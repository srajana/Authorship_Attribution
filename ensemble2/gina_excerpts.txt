A highly promoted and widely used computerized system for examining mammograms is leading to less accuracy, not more, a new study finds. The system, known as computer-aided detection, or CAD, did not find more breast cancer, researchers are reporting today. But it did lead to many more false alarms that resulted in additional testing and biopsies for spots on mammograms that turned out to be harmless. Such detection systems, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998, are sold by several companies, including Hologic of Bedford, Mass.; iCAD of Nashua, N.H.; and Kodak. According to the National Cancer Institute, the systems are now being used in about 30 percent of mammography centers. The equipment is expensive, costing $50,000 to $175,000, but Medicare, assuming it would improve the outcome, pays an extra $20 for each mammogram read with it. That made it profitable for large centers to use it. Doctors also worried about lawsuits if they were not using it and missed a cancer.
Researchers, both those associated with the studies and others who were not, said they hoped the findings would ease what they called inflated public fear of Lyme disease, which is widely perceived as a grave illness that is easy to catch. A total of  16,019 cases were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 1999; 92 percent of those cases were in nine states, most of which are in the Northeast, including New York and Connecticut. Dr. Leonard H. Sigal, a Lyme disease expert at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey-Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, who was not associated with the studies, said the message from them was that ''Lyme disease, although a problem, is not nearly as big a problem as most people think.'' ''The bigger epidemic,'' Dr. Sigal said, ''is Lyme anxiety.'' The study to see whether a single dose of the antibiotic doxycycline could prevent Lyme disease was directed by Dr. Robert B. Nadelman, a professor of medicine at New York Medical College and attending physician at the Westchester Medical Center, both in Valhalla, N.Y.
About the same time, Dr. Raymond N. DuBois, the director of the cancer prevention program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, noticed studies indicating that people who used aspirin regularly for, say, arthritis, contracted colon cancer at only about half the rate of people over all. At first, he said, he and his colleagues doubted that the finding was a matter of cause and effect. But the evidence continued to accumulate.  Some studies were enormous, like one involving 104,217 elderly people who were part of the Tennessee Medicaid program. Dr. DuBois became so intrigued that he decided to test the idea that anti-inflammatory drugs could inhibit colon cancer by testing cells in the laboratory and by conducting studies in animals. Other researchers took up the search, and more and more studies were done. By now, said Dr. Ernest Hawk, who is chief of the gastrointestinal cancer research group in the institute's division of cancer prevention, about 50 studies show that blocking cox-2 can prevent premalignant and malignant tumors in animals, and not just colon cancers.
''It is nearly impossible to avoid a reaction,'' Ms. Mu√±oz-Furlong said. ''There is no break in the constant worry about a reaction or the possibility of death.'' A drug that might provide a buffer zone, letting people accidentally consume a few peanuts without reactions, could transform lives, she said, adding: ''This study is the first ray of hope for individuals with peanut allergies that they might survive their next accidental ingestion.'' The study, reported yesterday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in Denver, was relatively small. It involved 84 patients ages 12 to 60. Experts said that the team had not only demonstrated a pronounced effect by giving the drug prophylactically, but that they had also showed that the more drug they gave the more they protected from the allergy. ''I think the evidence is quite convincing,'' said Dr. Henry Metzger, an immunologist at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
Scientists in Texas have cloned a cat, opening the door to what some experts say will be the first large-scale commercial use of cloning -- to reproduce beloved pets. The effort was supported by a company, Genetic Savings and Clone, of College Station, Tex., and Sausalito, Calif., which wants to offer cloning to dog and cat owners.  It is investing $3.7 million in the project. The study will be published in the Feb. 21 issue of Nature, a British science journal, but Nature released the paper yesterday because the result, although not the details of the study, had become  public. News of the company's success was first reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal. It was, some said, long expected. ''The commercial future of cloning is absolutely in animals,'' said Dr. Arthur Caplan, an ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. ''To put it bluntly, human cloning will turn out to be of interest only to the vain or the desperate, and companies know this. There is no commercial company that I'm aware of that is really interested in human cloning. But on the animal side, there is tremendous interest.''
But, Dr. Hansen cautions, proving a surrogate marker works ''is going to take a very long time, particularly if this pill is something you need to take in your 30's and 40's.'' Yet such markers must exist, researchers say. After all, said Dr. Douglas P. Kiel, director of medical research at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center for the Aged in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, people age at different rates. Some scientists have proposed that more than two dozen blood chemicals, taken together, act as biological markers and might be linked to aging. These include measures of inflammation (one hypothesis says that inflammatory damage contributes to the physical signs of growing old). Levels of growth factor, a muscle-promoting, insulin-like substance that dips in concentration with age, may also be factors. Other researchers prefer physical measurements. How fast do you walk? How quickly can you rise from a chair? How long can you stand on one foot with eyes closed?
Arteries removed during autopsies of heart attack patients tell the story. ''There are all kind of plaques, cheek by jowl,'' Dr. Libby says. There is the large, ugly yellow plaque that led to the heart attack. It popped open one day, attracting red blood cells that formed a clot on its surface, blocking the artery. There also are grayish-white plaques, old ulcerated plaques that became calcified. There is so-called vulnerable plaque, the pustules that are ready to burst. And there are yellowish streaks, thought to be plaques starting to develop. Patients typically have dozens of vulnerable plaques, and it is impossible to know which will burst and which of those will result in a blood clot that blocks an artery. ''From 100 plaque ruptures, it is only one that causes a heart attack,'' said Dr. Valentin Fuster, a professor of cardiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
He knows his results make many people uncomfortable because they suggest that free will may be an illusion when it comes to how much a person eats. ''Lean people think they stay lean because they are morally superior,'' he said. His data suggest that they are simply genetically lucky. He also knows there is money to be made in circumventing genes that make people fat -- whether truly obese or simply heavier than normal. That is fine with Dr. O'Rahilly, he says, because a drug for the masses will be a drug for his patients. ''Would I use a powerful pill?'' he said. ''You betcha.'' Obesity Inc. Articles in this series will periodically examine causes, costs and possible cures for obesity, one of the nation's major preoccupations.
''You become aware of people's preconceptions and biases,'' she went on. ''All of a sudden, the world divides itself into two kinds of people. Those who get it and those who don't. Those who have been in contact with their own fragility and those who have not.'' Cancer also becomes part of the person's identity, whether they seek it or not, said Dr. Jimmie Holland, a psychiatrist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. ''One man,'' she recalled, ''said to me: 'I used to be just Joe. Now I'm Joe, the cancer patient. Why can't I go back to being just Joe again?''' ''You can't,'' Dr. Holland said. For Doug Ulman, director of survivorship studies at the Lance Armstrong Foundation, being a survivor means understanding that the initial treatments are just the start of a new life. At age 26, Mr. Ulman has had chondrosarcoma, a rare tumor that produces cartilage, and two episodes of melanoma.
He tried it in training, and used it in the race. ''I definitely think it helped me,'' Mr. Spence said. Two American men, Steve Taylor and Brad Hudson, chose not to use glycerin in the Tokyo marathon, Dr. Martin said. Mr. Hudson did not finish the race, and Mr. Taylor ''finished miserably,'' coming in 26th, Dr. Martin said. Mr. Spence used glycerin again in the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, where he finished 12th. So did the other two American men in the marathon, Ed Eyestone, who finished 13th, and Bob Kempainen who finished 17th. One American woman, Cathy O'Brien, used it and finished 10th, Dr. Martin said. But the glycerin trick is not widely known, and that is just what Dr. Martin wants. He and his colleagues studied it in the early 1990's, testing it on athletes and asking, he said, ''if it did any harm and whether they could finish a 20-mile run in hot weather and feel great.''
Other researchers, who saw Dr. Berry's analysis in advance of its presentation yesterday, said they found the hypothesis convincing. Susan Ellenberg, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania, said the work was provocative. And, she added, ''I certainly don't see any obvious thing that says, 'Oh, this can't be right,' or any obvious flaws.'' Until 2002, as many as a third of American women over age 50 were taking menopausal hormones. The drugs could relieve symptoms like hot flashes, and were thought to protect against heart disease. Because the pills were known to slow bone loss, some women used them to prevent osteoporosis. Some women and doctors also believed, without any good evidence, that the pills could keep skin youthful, preserve memory and make women energetic. The use of estrogen to treat menopause took off in 1966, when a doctor, Robert Wilson, wrote the best-selling book ''Feminine Forever'' and flew across the country promoting it. He insisted that estrogen could keep women young, healthy and attractive. Women would be replacing a hormone they had lost at menopause just as diabetics replace the insulin their pancreas fails to make.
Whatever the reason, the falling number of abortions has come at a time when the number of clinics in major cities has not changed. Since 1992, the number of clinics doing 400 or more abortions a year has remained steady at 690. It is in these clinics -- 99 percent of which are in metropolitan areas -- that 89 percent of abortions take place. The Cost of Competition Clinic owners say they have little choice but to cluster in cities -- that is the only way they can find enough patients. Ruth Arick, the owner of Choice Pursuits in DeLand, Fla., which does management consulting  for abortion clinics, said that a population of about 200,000 is needed to support a full-fledged clinic. Abortion clinics are not so different from other specialty services, said Dr. William Ramos, who runs an abortion clinic in Las Vegas. ''In the entire state of Nevada, there is only one Lexus dealer and only one Acura dealer,'' he said.
''But if we go into the room of someone who's relatively healthy,'' he went on, ''the heart rate will be bouncing around.'' The explanation, experts say, involves the two competing nerve networks that control the heart's beats. The sympathetic system speeds up the heart, the parasympathetic system slows it down. In healthy people, the two systems are constantly working in opposition, making the heart rate fluctuate. But, said Dr. Arthur Moss, a heart disease researcher at the University of Rochester, ''the sicker the heart, the greater the likelihood that it will be dominated by the sympathetic nervous system.'' He added, ''If the heart is weakened, you can influence the output of blood by stimulating the heart to beat faster.'' And ''if you stimulate the heart, the heart rate will be more regular.'' As the sympathetic nervous system flogs the heart more and more, the heart can falter. ''It's very much like whipping a tired horse -- you get dysfunction,'' Dr. Moss said.
If Dr. Faustman's findings could be applied to humans, there would be no need for islet cell transplants. Embryonic stem cells, which many researchers believed might be turned into islet cells, eliminating the need to get islets for transplants from cadavers, would also be unnecessary. In fact, the work meant that unless the underlying immune system attack on the pancreas was stopped, these replacement cells would eventually be destroyed anyway, so such treatments would never be a cure. Dr. Faustman published the work in The Journal of Clinical Investigation in 2001. ''We weren't allowed to use the word 'regenerate,''' she said. ''People didn't believe that an organ could regenerate.'' Instead, she had to say ''restoration of insulin secretion by return of blood sugar to normal.'' Even though the islet cells were growing back, it was still unclear where the new cells were coming from. Before long, Dr. Faustman had a surprising answer. They were from the spleen, a fist-size organ on the left side of the diaphragm whose pulpy interior is filled with blood.
His analysis of cancer statistics leads Dr. Peto to this firm conclusion: ''Pollution is not a major determinant of U.S. cancer rates.'' Advocates for cancer patients, like Ms. Gillick, of Toms River, N.J., do not agree. They say they have heard it all -- scientists' insistence that the risk of cancer from environmental chemicals is very low, that it is almost impossible to ascribe cancer in any individual to an environmental exposure, that most cancers are just a result of unlikely genetic draw or spurious mutation. But Ms. Gillick and other advocates are not convinced. Her son Michael, 26, was given a diagnosis of neuroblastoma when he was 3 months old. Ms. Gillick had never heard of that cancer, a pediatric cancer of the sympathetic nervous system. But she soon learned how devastating it could be. Over the years, as Michael spent time in hospitals in New York and Philadelphia, she noticed something striking. Child after child in those cancer wards came from her town and surrounding Ocean County.
In the first week of 1999, Mr. Corser died. ''I had at that point a small quantity of his semen saved at Columbia,'' Ms. Morrison said. ''In March, I went to see Dr. Sauer and asked him if he would be willing to work with me. He said yes.'' She became pregnant on the second try, in October 1999, and had a son, Toby, on June 6, 2000. Neither mother nor baby is infected. ''It is unnervingly lonely to be pregnant and single,'' she recalled, ''particularly when you have a person in mind that you wish were there.'' Yet having Toby ''is the best thing I ever did,'' she said, and added: ''I might do it again. I have a little sperm left.''
In an effort to get the message out, the federal health care research agency recently printed pamphlets for men and women, telling them what tests they need, and when. But doctors say they have yet to see a patient come in waving the guidelines and asking for fewer tests. And many doctors say that although they are well aware of what evidence-based medicine recommends, they often do much more, out of habit and tradition and out of a fear that if they pulled back they would get the sort of reaction Dr. Min did. Even some Preventive Services Task Force members who helped write the recommendations do not always strictly adhere to them. Dr. Steven H. Woolf, a task force member who is a professor of family practice at Virginia Commonwealth University, explained, ''I do physical exams and I do those procedures that lack an evidence base, often because patients will think they have not gotten their money's worth if there is no laying on of hands.''
Before the 1940s when a pertussis vaccine for children was introduced, whooping cough was a leading cause of death in young children. The vaccine led to an 80 percent drop in the disease's incidence, but did not completely eliminate it. That is because the vaccine's effectiveness wanes after about a decade, and although there is now a new vaccine for adolescents and adults, it is only starting to come into use. Whooping cough, Dr. Kretsinger said, is still a concern. The disease got its name from its most salient feature: Patients may cough and cough and cough until they have to gasp for breath, making a sound like a whoop. The coughing can last so long that one of the common names for whooping cough was the 100-day cough, Dr. Talbot said. But neither coughing long and hard nor even whooping is unique to pertussis infections, and many people with whooping cough have symptoms that like those of common cold: a runny nose or an ordinary cough.
When the cast finally came off, the patient's limb would be stiff, the muscles atrophied. ''It would take six months of therapy to get strength and motion back,'' Dr. Kocher said. At the same time, in a parallel path, researchers were learning that painful conditions that are essentially inflammation -- arthritis and chronic lower back pain -- actually improve when patients keep moving. Now some researchers, like Dr. Freddie Fu, a sports medicine expert and chairman of the orthopedic surgery department at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and a colleague, James H-C. Wang, are studying minor injuries at the molecular level. Their focus is on tendinitis -- the inflamed tendons that are the bane of many exercisers and that affect 15 to 20 percent of all Americans at any given time. The symptoms are all too familiar -- pain, swelling and soreness. To study the injury process, Dr. Wang grows human tendons in the laboratory, stretching them repeatedly. In separate experiments, he has mice run on treadmills until their tendons begin to show the tiny microscopic tears that occur in the early stages of tendinitis.
But, Dr. Sauer asked, what are the egg recipients thinking when they offer to pay so much for a donor with such specific traits? ''What genetic textbook did they read,'' he asks, that would tell them that they could order up a tall, smart, athletic child by paying $50,000 for a donor? But other experts say they fail to see what is so wrong with looking for specific traits in a donor and paying $50,000 for them. Dr. Norman Fost, who directs the program in medical ethics at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, said it was not so crazy to ask for height and S.A.T. scores. Dr. Fost said he worried more about parents who tried to engineer their children after they were born, pushing them to get perfect grades and to take endless S.A.T. tutoring courses. ''I don't think that genetic engineering is any more pernicious,'' he said.
One 43-year-old who had her uterus and ovaries removed two years ago wrote: ''The aftereffects were terrible. The hot flashes, the night sweats, mood swings were more than I could live with. The idea of going back to the condition I was in postsurgery is scary to me.'' Another woman, who had taken estrogen since 1984, wrote that she was ''more confused now than ever.'' ''I have two doctors that I've used for a couple of years, and one says go off hormones and the other says stay on them,'' she said. Dr. Margery Gass, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Cincinnati and the immediate past president of the North American Menopause Society, said there were answers for such women but added, ''The problem is our answers may not be based on data.'' Dr. Gass says she tells patients that even if estrogen increases a younger woman's risk for stroke as much as in older women, the risk is still very low.
Other proponents of high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets claim that they work because they make you lose your cravings for food. Dr. Robert C. Atkins, who, like Dr. Levin, claims his diet can alleviate many ills as well as make you thin, explains the theory on his Web site: ''The biggest battle that most people have with weight loss is the constant obsession with food,'' he writes. The reason, he adds, is ''blood sugar fluctuations that are aggravated by carbohydrate consumption (especially the refined kind).'' But on his diet, which cuts out carbohydrates, Dr. Atkins concludes, ''no more false hunger pains.'' But studies say that no matter what diet, you will feel great at first and report that hunger pangs are disappearing. Then, as time wears on, hunger will come roaring back. Evidence for that includes a paper, published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 1985 by Dr. James C. Rosen of the University of Vermont, Dr. Ethan A. H. Sims, an emeritus professor there, and colleagues. In the study, some obese patients went on a low-carbohydrate diet and then a high-carbohydrate diet and others had the diets in the reverse order. The investigators wrote: ''the initial two weeks of dieting was associated with a decrease in appetite and elevation of psychological well-being, regardless of the composition of the diet.'' But, ''Thereafter, appetite and mood approached basal levels. Further changes in these psychological reactions to dieting did not vary with the type of diet.''
He asked for the test to be repeated, ''just to make sure,'' he said. In August, he had another CRP test. Once again, the level was 3.1. ''I don't know how you get it down,'' Mr. Newton said. ''I don't know what it means. Are your arteries swollen up or does it make your arteries swell up?'' In the meantime, he worries. Mr. Newton's quandary is becoming more common as scientists become increasingly convinced that CRP and heart disease are linked but do not know exactly what the relationship is. Until recently, it was the doctors who made the decisions about whether and whom to test for CRP. Most patients had never heard of the protein. That has been changing with increasing publicity; after widespread news reports on two studies published in The New England Journal of Medicine last week, some doctors say they are being flooded with requests from people who want a CRP test, now.
Some experts, however, said they thought the finding in the subgroup was likely to be real. ''Our take on this study is that it did find that the combination relieved pain in people who have moderate-to-severe pain,'' said Dr. Klippel of the Arthritis Foundation. M. Elizabeth Halloran, a biostatistics professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington in Seattle, who had no association with the study, also thought there was an effect. Dr. Halloran said she was swayed not only by the data but also by her sister's experience giving the supplements to her arthritic dog. ''If I had severe pain from osteoarthritis of the knee, based on this study, I would try glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate,'' Dr. Halloran said. But Donald Berry, chairman of the department of biostatistics at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston, who had no association with the study, said he was completely unconvinced by the subgroup finding.
Every time that Marion Nestle sees a new doctor, the awkward question comes up. The doctor looks at her age: 63. The doctor looks at her family history: heart disease. And the doctor asks her why on earth is she not taking estrogen? ''Every encounter with a new doctor involves a discussion about it, not raised by me, raised by the doctor,'' said Dr. Nestle, who is a professor and chairwoman of the department of nutrition and food studies at New York University. ''Are you taking it? Have you considered taking it? At your age, you should be taking it.'' Her experience is common, women say. As soon as women approach menopause, their doctors often start asking when they will start taking hormone replacement therapy. And if the woman hesitates, her doctor will often explain that the hormones can protect her against heart disease, the leading killer of women. But now, a huge federal study of hormone replacement therapy is calling that idea into question and doctors and individual women are trying to deal with the consequences. Phones rang in doctors' offices throughout the country yesterday, and doctors braced themselves for the inevitable questions that would come up in every office visit with a postmenopausal woman.
Some matchmakers advised their clients to be screened for the gene, and made sure carriers did not marry. Thirty years later, Tay-Sachs is virtually gone, its incidence slashed more than 95 percent. The disease is now so rare that most doctors have never seen a case. Emboldened by that success and with new technical tools that make genetic screening cheap and simple, a group is aiming even higher. It wants to eliminate nine other genetic diseases from the Ashkenazic population, which has been estimated at 10 million, in a worldwide screening. The groundwork is laid, the group says. Its members -- genetic counselors, geneticists and pediatricians at the New York University School of Medicine, the Montefiore Medical Center and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine -- point out that the genes for the major recessive diseases that afflict Ashkenazim have been isolated. New technology allows screening for all those diseases, plus Tay-Sachs, at once.
It can sound like haggling over minutiae, but the difference is substantial, Dr. Applebaum said. ''From our perspective, it was so difficult for them to say what constitutes agreement,'' she said. ''There had to be a consensus, if you will.'' Now the agency is planning to do what her group has wanted for years. ''They moved it to making an assessment of the weight of the evidence,'' she said. For example, Dr. Applebaum said, food manufacturers have long wanted to label products that contain Omega-3 fatty acids, which are present in certain fish oils, as being good for the heart. Under its old standard, the F.D.A. turned them down. ''Are we revisiting that one right now? You bet we are,'' Dr. Applebaum said. ''The weight of the evidence is that you can't ignore it.'' Not everyone is so delighted. ''My sense is that this is a lowering of standards,'' Dr. Kessler said. ''It's a cave to the food industry.''
In a 23-to-4 vote, two expert advisory committees to the Food and Drug Administration recommended Tuesday that a so-called morning-after pill to prevent unintended pregnancies be sold over the counter. The F.D.A. usually follows its committees' advice, although the final decision rests with its commissioner, Dr. Mark B. McClellan. But the overwhelming vote by the agency's outside advisers led proponents as well as opponents to expect that Dr. McClellan would go along with the committees, making his decision within weeks to months. The drug is an emergency contraceptive known as Plan B, to be taken when regular contraception either fails or is skipped. Consisting of two high-dose birth control pills, Plan B is meant to be used within 72 hours after unprotected sexual intercourse and may prevent up to 89 percent of unplanned pregnancies. If approved, widespread availability of Plan B could have an impact second only to the advent of the birth control pill, advocates say. The proponents, including groups like Planned Parenthood, argued to the panel that Plan B was safe and could prevent as many as half of the three million unintended pregnancies in the United States each year.
The scientists injected the animals with two AIDS virus genes along with stimulants for cells to make an immune system hormone to speed the production of CD8 cells. Cells picked up the DNA and used those viral genes to make viral proteins. The proteins were harmless to the cells, but the cells responded as they did to any foreign proteins -- they put pieces of the proteins on their surfaces, signaling killer T-cells to proliferate. The hormone amplified this process. The result was a wave of killer cells. Ordinarily, a monkey infected with an AIDS-like virus might end up with 5 percent to 10 percent of its billions of CD8 cells dedicated to fighting the virus. But, Dr. Letvin and his colleagues found, when they used their new vaccine and then infected the monkeys with an AIDS virus, the animals would have up to 30 percent of their CD8 cells specifically designed to fight the infection with the virus.
Mary Wittenberg, the 44-year-old president of New York Road Runners, is a fast, strong and experienced runner. But she races best, she says, when she runs just behind Witold Bialokur. He can run 10 kilometers, or 6.2 miles, in less than 44 minutes and he is so smooth and controlled. ''He's like a metronome with his pacing,'' Ms. Wittenberg says. ''I am often struggling to keep up with him and it's a good day when I do.'' While Mr. Bialokur's performance would be the envy of most young men, he is not young. Mr. Bialokur is 71. It is one of the persistent mysteries of aging, researchers say. Why would one person, like Mr. Bialokur, remain so hale and hearty while another, who had seemed just as healthy, start to weaken and slow down, sometimes as early as his 70's? That, says Tamara Harris, who is chief of the geriatric epidemiology section at the National Institute on Aging, is a central issue that is only now being systematically addressed. The question is why some age well and others do not, often heading along a path that ends up in a medical condition known as frailty.
British scientists report that microwave radiation can indirectly damage roundworms. Their data, the investigators say, bear on the question of whether cellular telephones are safe. But several American scientists questioned whether the worm experiments had anything to do with cell phone safety. The study, by David de Pomerai of the University of Nottingham and his colleagues, will appear in the May 25 issue of Nature, a British science journal. The journal's editors decided to release it yesterday because they thought that it might be important in discussions of a report by a committee of scientists convened by the British government to assess the safety of cellular telephones. On Thursday, that committee reported that while there was no direct evidence of danger from the popular devices, there were some worrisome findings, like the study with worms. To be on the safe side, they said, children under age 16 should limit their use of cellular telephones.
There is a reason the truth is so hard to find, he said. Increasingly, researchers are looking for very small effects like a tiny edge in a battle against heart disease. If an effect is huge like the increased risk that a person who smokes will develop lung cancer, an observational study will correctly find it. If a treatment is truly sensational, Dr. Peto said, its benefits will be so clear that any study, randomized or observational, will find them. The problems occur in questions like the one on estrogen, he said, ''when the effects aren't very big.'' If there is no effect or just a tiny one, chance comes into play, making one study turn out slightly positive and another slightly negative, and any flaw in a study or its analysis can throw the results into the wrong column. Dr. Michels has a particular stake in the estrogen debate because she works with data from one of the biggest and, most experts say, one of the best observational studies, the Nurses' Health Study. It saw, correctly, that smoking led to heart disease and lung cancer. It also found that smokers who stopped reduced their risk. But it also found the vitamin E effect on heart disease and it found the benefits of hormone replacement therapy that are now under question.
The company created nearly 500 embryos by cloning; 30 survived to birth, of which 24 grew to adulthood. The Advanced Cell Technology researchers, led by Dr. Robert P. Lanza, its medical director and vice president of medical and scientific development, are publishing their study on Nov. 30 in Science. But the journal released the paper today because the scientists will be describing their results next week at the National Academy of Sciences. Another company, Infigen, in DeForest, Wis., says it will be reporting similar results at the meeting, on Nov. 27 to 29, called ''Defining Science-Based Concerns Associated With Animal Biotechnology.'' In its Science paper, the Advanced Cell Technology group reports on clones it created by transferring skin cells from fetal calves into cow eggs whose own genetic material had been removed. The genes from the added cells directed the development of embryos that were clones of the fetuses from which the skin was taken, and the group then transferred those embryos to cows that would serve as surrogate mothers.
''At my age, you adjust to things,'' he said. But in Princeton, Dr. Dultz's patient, Ms. Buchanan, is just as devoted to her and to the hospital there. Dr. Dultz said she encouraged her patients to seek second opinions, but only half do, and nearly all decide to stay at the Princeton hospital. As a result, Dr. Dultz said, she ends up operating on about 200 women a year, which puts her and the hospital into the high-volume category. Those who leave for major medical centers tell her they were persuaded by other family members, she added. A small hospital offers more than the mechanics of medicine, Dr. Dultz said. She tries to always be there for her patients, giving out her home phone number and her cellphone number, meeting patients in the emergency room, going into her office to see patients early in the morning or after her staff has left for the day.
Dr. Scott and his colleagues offered half the patients their usual care and the others an opportunity to make any regular appointments they wanted but also to attend a monthly group visit with their doctor. The results were so encouraging in reducing doctor visits while improving patients' health that Dr. Scott expanded it to a study involving 800 patients. Those results which, were even more encouraging, have now been submitted to a leading medical journal for publication. Both studies found that patients who were offered group visits stayed healthier, with significantly fewer visits to the emergency room and to specialists and a slower rate of physical decline. And the patients were happier with their doctors. At first, patients in both groups rated their doctor highly. As time went on, however, those who were seeing their doctor only in the traditional method of office visits liked the doctor less while those who were seeing their doctor in the group visits liked the doctor more.
Dr. Samuel H. Preston, a demographer who is dean of the School of Arts and Sciences at the University of Pennsylvania, said that when he was a graduate student in the 1960's no one would have expected the death rates from heart diseases to decline. ''They hadn't moved for several decades and there was a suggestion that they may be rising with affluence,'' Dr. Preston recalled. ''There was a general aura of pessimism. Then all of a sudden in 1968, the rates began to go down very, very steadily and they have continued to go down.'' The disease control centers said no single factor was responsible. Instead, it noted, the contributing factors constitute an almost humdrum list inspired by public health campaigns and clinical trials that showed the benefits of controlling the risks and treating the diseases. One major factor was a decline in cigarette smoking, with 25 percent of adults smoking today compared with  42 percent 30 years ago. Other factors included better control of blood pressure, decreases in cholesterol levels and improved treatments of heart attacks and strokes. .
In a 9-to-6 vote, an advisory panel to the Food and Drug Administration recommended on Wednesday that silicone breast implants be allowed back on the market after an 11-year hiatus. But, concerned about a dearth of data on how safe the implants are and how well they hold up over a decade or more, the panel said its approval was contingent on a list of conditions, like education of surgeons and patients and continued monitoring of women who get implants. The implant maker, the Inamed Corporation, had volunteered most of those conditions in seeking the agency's approval. The Food and Drug Administration usually goes along with the advice of its expert panels, even when the vote is divided. Kathleen Quinn, a spokeswoman for the agency, said it would decide in ''weeks to months,'' but there was no specific time line. The panel's decision worried some who said they were not convinced the safety of silicone implants had been established. Some expressed concern that the provisions for monitoring women with implants were not enough to make a difference.
SCIENTISTS wasted little time deploring the announcement by a religious sect that it has created the first human clone. It's not just because Clonaid, the company founded by the leader of the sect, the Ra√´lians, has so far failed to support its claims with even a shred of evidence. It is also because cloning has two meanings. And scientists worry that the public and Congress don't understand the distinctions. What many scientists want to do is therapeutic cloning, which would create replacement cells for sick people, cells that their bodies would not reject because they would be genetically identical to their own. They want to cure diseases, not create cloned humans. What Clonaid said it did is reproductive cloning, which creates humans but has no role in curing disease. Please, scientists plead with the public, don't tar us with the same brush. ''A knee-jerk reaction to Clonaid's claims could set back much important medical research for years,'' said Dr. Albert H. Teich, head of the Directorate for Science and Policy Programs at the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
''Patients rarely come in with a pure problem in primary care,'' she added. ''It is the rare patient who comes in and says, 'I'm here to follow up on diabetes.' Instead, there is a new skin rash or a worry about arthritis. And then, 'Oh, by the way, I've got diabetes.' The chart's this thick and by the time I deal with all of their immediate concerns, the chronic condition is last on the list and it's very easy to forget things.'' But participating in the program is costing each doctor in the group $500 a month for four years for the electronic medical record system. Other innovations, like group office visits and e-mailing with patients, are poorly compensated, if at all. Nor are the follow-up calls by a nurse checking on patients when a doctor changes a medication or recommends a different regimen. ''I've been in practice for 25 years and I've made less money this year than I ever did before,'' Dr. Safford said.
''It's a widespread belief,'' Ms. Koenig said. And it is not restricted to women with breast cancer. Jim Kiefert of Olympia, Wash., is absolutely convinced that stress led to his prostate cancer. It was diagnosed in 1989, when he was 50. Mr. Kiefert was a school superintendent, and he was in the midst of difficult negotiations with teachers over their contracts. ''I was stressed out,'' he says. ''I know stress caused my cancer.'' The question of whether there is a link between stress and cancer has puzzled and intrigued researchers as well as patients. Study after study has asked whether people who developed cancer had more stress in the years before the diagnosis, and conversely, whether people who experienced extreme stress were more likely to develop cancer. Investigators have also explored possible mechanisms, asking, for example, whether stress might suppress the immune system cells that might be needed to squelch rogue cancer cells. And they have tried to determine whether the immune system, the body's defense system, protects people from cancer in the first place.
In desperation, Dr. Kessler said he sometimes sent fat children and their families to a nutritionist in nearby Wilmington, Del. But, he said, all too often, ''they lose weight and then they gain it back again.'' 2 Children, 2 Outcomes If ever there were two people who exemplified the mysteries of obesity, they are Sandie Sabo and Cheryl Haworth. To look at Ms. Sabo today, at her current weight of 370 pounds, it might be assumed that she was always fat. But Ms. Sabo, who owns a clothing store for fat women in Carlsbad, Calif., said she was normal sized as a child and adolescent. ''I was just your basic average-sized kid,'' she said. ''I never had food or eating issues at all.'' It was not until adulthood that the pounds started accumulating while Ms. Sabo, increasingly desperate, tried every diet, every weight-loss program. But while she always lost weight, the pounds came right back again, and more.
But Ms. Torrente said that those who reuse devices that are designed for single use are playing a risky game. ''If this is so safe and so O.K., why don't we tell the patients?'' Ms. Torrente asked. Dr. Haines said there was no reason to bring it up. ''Why force the issue?'' he said. ''Show us the data that says this is exposing the patient to increased risk.'' What if patients started insisting that Dr. Haines use new devices, fresh out of the package? ''If we found that a lot of patients were starting to demand that we use brand new equipment,'' Dr. Haines said, ''we would probably decline to take their cases and refer them elsewhere.''
But, Dr. Miller and others emphasized, the point is that a pinpoint genetic change in mice lengthened their life spans. Now, Dr. Miller said, another scientist, Dr. William Atchley of North Carolina State University, has bred 15 lines of mice, looking for variations in body size. Six turn into giant mice, six into small mice as adolescents but sometimes grow larger by adulthood, and three turn into medium-sized mice. The mice that remain small live on average 941 days and the large ones live a shorter time, with one living just 344 days. Dr. Atchley has asked Dr. Miller to look for the genetic changes that make the difference. The same thing happens with dogs, Dr. Miller said, noting that small dogs live much longer than large ones. Even small grasshoppers live longer than bigger ones, Dr. Miller said. Is the same true for people? ''We don't know,'' he replied, explaining that properly controlled studies have not been done.
So, she and others say, perhaps it should be no surprise that even though smoking is much more common in Britain, and it is the leading cause of cancer, nearly twice as many Americans as Britons -- 9.5 percent -- said they had had cancer. And the more educated Americans reported the highest rates -- 10.5 percent. As for heart disease, 50 percent more Americans than Britons say they have it, and more say they have high blood pressure and high cholesterol. But when Dr. Marmot and his colleagues looked at actual measurements of blood pressure in British and American populations ages 40 to 70, there was no difference. And Americans had lower cholesterol than the British. The paper did not include actual outcomes from heart disease, like heart attacks. The one area where the Americans stand out is with a blood marker for diabetes. The paper reports that 6.4 percent of Americans had elevated levels of hemoglobin A1c, compared with 3.8 percent of Britons.
Until now there has been no large national study on the subject and few studies done outside the auspices of the College Board or the companies that sell test preparation courses. Previous studies with designs like Mr. Briggs's have found similarly  small effects from coaching. Other studies have sometimes reported far more substantial benefits in coaching, but they also have had serious design flaws, said Dr. Nan Laird, a biostatistics professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, and other academic statisticians who have examined the data. Dr. Laird said most of the studies that showed big gains simply compared test scores before and after students were coached. But they did not include, for comparison, the scores of students who were not coached but who simply took the tests again. Retaking itself usually results in higher scores. While not arguing with the study itself, testing companies said the results did not apply to them.
For those who agreed, the day of surgery meant being wheeled into an operating room while neither they nor any of the medical staff knew what their treatment would be. When they were on the operating table, Dr. Moseley, who did all the operations, opened a sealed envelope telling him whether the patient was to have the surgery or not. Those in the placebo group received a drug that put them to sleep. Unlike those getting the real operation, they did not have general anesthesia. Dr. Moseley made small cuts in their knees to simulate an operation. He bent and straightened the knee and asked for surgical instruments, just in case the patient was partly conscious. An assistant sloshed water in a bucket to make the sound of a knee being flushed clean. The paper in The New England Journal is accompanied by two editorials. One, by Sam Horng and Dr. Franklin G. Miller of the National Institutes of Health, asks whether placebo surgery is unethical. The controversy, they wrote, comes because doctors assume that patients in clinical research should not be put at risk if they cannot benefit, and placebo surgery involves risk.
''We were all experienced colonoscopists,'' said Dr. Robert L. Barclay, a member of the group that participated in the study, Rockford Gastroenterology Associates in Rockford, Ill. ''We had each done 3,000 or more colonoscopies before the study.'' Yet, Dr. Barclay added, ''if our group is representative of an average group, you will see people who take 2 or 3 minutes and people who take 20 minutes'' to examine a colon. Insurers pay doctors the same no matter how much time they spend. Gastroenterologists say colonoscopies can help prevent colon cancer, but warn that there is a pressing need for better quality control. Still, the experts say, the onus remains on patients to ask for data on how proficient their doctors are. ''Patients assume that one colonoscopist is as good as another,'' said Dr. Douglas K. Rex, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine at Indiana University who did not take part in the study. ''But these are dramatic differences.''
Many of the patients treated have been Iraqis. ''By Geneva Convention and NATO standards, casualties are taken care of in order of priority, based on injury and illness, not based on uniform,'' Dr. Jenkins said. ''That's been the policy back to our own Civil War at least.'' Col. John Holcomb, a surgeon who directs the Army Institute of Surgical Research in San Antonio, said some of the innovations came from after-action reviews in which doctors analyzed data on why soldiers died, where they died, and how. Each branch of the service makes its own decisions about which innovations to adopt. For example, the Marine Corps has added a new product, QuikClot, to every marine's first-aid kit, said Lt. Cmdr. Joe DaCorta, who is in charge of expeditionary medicine at the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab in Quantico, Va. The substance was tested for battlefield use by Dr. Hasan Alam, a trauma surgeon at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md. Dr. Alam said he was haunted by troops who bled to death in Somalia before surgeons could help them.
But Jim's doctor suggested that he be tested for H.I.V. ''I said, no, that was crazy,'' Jim recalled. He went home, but soon he was back, asking for the test. ''I had to know,'' he said. And when the results came back, he learned that the doctor's hunch had been right. His blood was swarming with H.I.V. ''I was in shock,'' Jim said. Soon, he found himself enrolled in a new study at the Massachusetts General Hospital that had initially seemed so controversial that the hospital's ethics board had taken nearly a year to approve it. The idea was to see if the immune systems of newly infected people could be taught to control the AIDS virus on their own. The goal was to enable patients eventually to do without  the powerful drugs that can keep the virus in check. The study is on the frontiers of AIDS research, an arena where scientists are asking questions that are stunningly fundamental. And they are recruiting patients who are often astonished by what is being asked of them.
A more subtle problem occurs when doctors who are generally pleasant and communicative act differently toward certain patients, affected more than they realize by their personal prejudices against particular patients, like fat people, hypochondriacs or people who complain about pain. ''If you happen to be the person they don't like, they can respond very differently than they do to most people,'' said Dr. Howard Beckman, the medical director of the Rochester Independent Practice Association. Fat people say they know that problem well. It happened last summer to Tina Hedberg of Conover, Wis., who saw a doctor when a diet she was on was no longer eliciting drastic weekly weight loss. The doctor, Ms. Hedberg said, told her that she had a mental problem because she weighed 400 pounds. Ms. Hedberg was trying to commit suicide by getting so fat, the doctor informed her. Then the doctor said Ms. Hedberg had two choices. She could be admitted to a mental institution, or, the doctor said, ''I could wire your jaws shut so tight that you can't move your jaws to talk, and if you can't talk you can't eat.''
Yet as excitement over stem cell research built over the summer, and surged again with recent reports of experiments with human cloning, scientists and doctors became deluged with calls from desperate patients who saw salvation around the corner. Somehow this research has come to be seen as the great hope for medical science. How, scientists ask, did expectations grow so quickly? Though some say the news media overplayed the issue, some scientists say the problem lies within themselves. The crucial questions involve basic research, the sort supported by federal funds and conducted in universities. But with calls by some politicians to ban the work, and to bar any use of tax money to pay for it, scientists say they feel obliged to stress how important the research is. And, some say, they now fear they may have promised too much. ''We're being forced into taking extreme positions by the whole need to try and convince people of the need to go ahead,'' Dr. Hogan said.
Dr. Gail Martin, a mouse stem cell researcher at the University of California at San Francisco, said: ''The expectations have been raised a little higher than perhaps is appropriate. It became politicized and tied up in the abortion debate.'' But, as the exaggerations and talk of revolutionary treatments continued, few made concerted efforts to set the record straight. And some small biotechnology companies continued to promise quick cures. One problem is simply to find a way to get stem cells to grow into the types of cells that are needed, and not a mixture of cells. Scientists know this is a thorny problem, but their views were not widely heard when the public and politicians seemed to assume that it was easy to grow any tissue type desired from embryonic stem cells. In fact, no one has been able to do this even with mouse cells. Using stem cells to cure diabetes, for example, would mean converting them to islet cells, specialized cells of the pancreas that secrete insulin. And then the new islet cells would have to be protected from the underlying disease process that caused the diabetes in the first place. The science is not even close.
Specialists get no more than primary care doctors for an office visit, but they provide tests and procedures that demand higher Medicare reimbursements. Doctors say those payments allow them to stay in business, especially if they provide the procedures in their own office. Medicare pays the doctor and the facility where a procedure is done. For a nuclear stress test, for example, the doctor gets about $200 and the facility gets about $1,200. ''Doctors have incorporated these tests as much as possible into their offices so they can gain from the facility fee,'' Dr. Thomas Bartzokis, an interventional cardiologist in Boca Raton, said. Patients say they have lots of specialists, and lots of tests. Asked how many doctors he saw, Leon Bloomberg, 83, a patient of Dr. Miller, thought for a minute and looked at his wife, Esther. ''Between us, we have 10 or 12,'' Mr. Bloomberg said, including a pain specialist and a neurologist for his neuropathy, a cardiologist for his heart condition, ''a pulmonary man'' for his asthma, a rheumatologist for his arthritis and Dr. Miller for his prostate. Mrs. Bloomberg has her own doctors, including ones for heart disease and for diabetes. ''We have two to four or more doctors' appointments a week,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.
The million patients a year who get stents typically get more than one, with some getting four or five, said Dr. David Hillis, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern School of Medicine, who called the increased use of defibrillators and coated stents ''a good way to bust the budget wide open.'' Medical experts say that in addition to the legitimate costs of each of these procedures, they fear technology creep -- an increasing use of expensive procedures to wider and wider groups of patients, many of whom may not benefit and may even be harmed. ''I think it is huge, I think it is pervasive. And it is a major driver in Medicare's cost growth,'' said Dr. Scott Ramsey, a health economist at the University of Washington who analyzed the cost of lung volume reduction surgery. ''The reason Medicare is cutting payments to doctors is that its expenses for technology are expanding so fast.''
The stories about patients who had their spleens removed are not proof that Dr. Faustman's work applies to humans as well as mice. ''Denise's work is remarkable in animals,'' Dr. Nathan said. ''But does it apply to humans? As a clinical investigator, I have to remain skeptical. Scientifically, is it a long shot? I don't know.'' Mr. Iacocca's check, and the money he wants to raise, will pay for the initial phase of a clinical trial, the first step for finding out. Dr. Nathan, who will direct the trial, will ask whether BCG kills the islet-destroying white blood cells of patients in the same way it does in mice and, if so, at what dose. Dr. Faustman is working on a blood test that will immediately assess the effects of BCG by determining whether the dangerous white cells are being destroyed. In the meantime, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation is financing an independent effort to replicate Dr. Faustman's work. The researcher, Dr. Anita Chong of the University of Chicago, said her studies were still under way. But, she added, ''so far, what we have done replicates what she has done.''
In the last 10 years, millions of patients have taken a class of drugs that can prevent agonizing broken and deteriorating bones. The drugs, called bisphosphonates, once seemed perfectly safe and have transformed life for patients with cancer or osteoporosis. But recently there have been reports of a serious side effect: death of areas of bone in the jaw. Everyone agrees that the condition, osteonecrosis of the jaw, is an uncommon complication but that its true incidence is not known. It is estimated that among the 500,000 American cancer patients who take the drugs because their disease is affecting their bones, 1 to 10 percent may develop the problem. As for the millions of osteoporosis patients, who take lower doses, the condition seems less common. But no one knows how much less. Some oral surgeons have as many as a couple of dozen cases, but their clinics have become centers to which patients elsewhere are referred. Among people with osteoporosis, only 15 cases of the new ailment have been reported in the medical literature.
But published studies were dismaying. ''We were struck by the real paucity of studies and the relatively small number of subjects in them,'' Dr. Blazer said. On the other hand, he said, testosterone may well be effective and the published studies do not show it is harmful. Still, the harms like an increased risk of prostate cancer or heart attack would emerge only from large studies, for example the federal study of estrogen in women, which followed thousands of participants for years. Some are impatient for such studies and think the new report calls for too slow a pace. ''Essentially what this means is we won't know for a long time,'' said Dr. Alvin Matsumoto of the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, who had proposed a large testosterone study. Dr. John B. McKinlay of the New England Research Institutes in Watertown, Mass., said proposing small trials was premature. There is no consensus on what level of testosterone in an older man is too low, Dr. McKinlay said; nor is there a consensus on how to measure testosterone levels, which can fluctuate from day to day.
But epidemiologists said non-randomized studies could be misleading. And, in fact, such studies previously indicated that estrogen could slow the progress of heart disease, making it all the more surprising when it did not and stunning some who had believed in the treatment.
Unlike ordinary cells, which divide a certain number of times in the laboratory and then stop, immortalized cells have genetic changes that allow them to divide indefinitely. Scientists used them because they were easy to maintain, said Scott Lowe, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. One paper, however, raised questions. Its lead author, H. Earl Ruley, now at Vanderbilt University, pointed out that the ras gene not only failed to produce cancer in cells that were not immortalized, but also seemed to do something else. It seemed to make such cells stop dividing altogether. It let them remain alive but never divide again. In his paper, published in 1988, Dr. Ruley even suggested pursuing the work to develop cancer therapies. That idea, however, went against the entire cancer gene hypothesis. Why would a cancer gene make a cell stop growing? Cancer genes were supposed to make cells grow out of control, not stop. And no one had any idea how such a process, if it were real, would even work.
The Rockford study was preceded by other signs that colonoscopies are by no means foolproof. But as problems have been pointed out, they have all too often been met with disbelief among doctors, Dr. Rex said. The first indication that colonoscopies were not as effective as widely believed came with two studies, one in 1991 and a larger one, in 1997, in which patients had two colonoscopies on the same day. Those studies showed that doctors were missing 15 to 27 percent of adenomas, including 6 percent of large adenomas. Then, in the last few years, two studies of so-called virtual colonoscopies, which use a CT scan to view the colon, found that the rate of overlooked adenomas in traditional colonoscopies was even higher. Patients in those studies had traditional and virtual colonoscopy on the same day. Traditional colonoscopies missed 12 to 17 percent of the large adenomas detected in the virtual colonoscopies. But many doctors dismissed those findings, saying -- if they believed them at all -- that they applied to other doctors, not to themselves, Dr. Rex said.
Correction:  January 25, 2003, Saturday  A chart in Science Times on Jan. 14 with an article about Alzheimer's disease misstated the chance that a person would have two variants of a protein known as Apo E. People may have Apo E4, a variant that may increase risk of the disease, or Apo E3, which does not, or a combination; it is not just one or the other.
After five unsuccessful attempts at artificial insemination with the washed sperm, the Florida doctor tried sperm washing combined with in vitro fertilization. That did not work either, so Mrs. Madeiros got in touch with Dr. Sauer. ''I know a lot of H.I.V.-positive people,'' Dr. Sauer recalled thinking. ''They are feeling well, they are doing well. Of course, a lot of them would want kids.'' When he decided to offer treatment to men with the virus, Dr. Sauer obtained the permission of his hospital's ethics committee and quietly began offering the procedure. In the meantime, Mrs. Madeiros became pregnant with the help of the Florida doctor and went on to have two children -- Ashley, now 3, and Taylor, 2 -- before her husband died last fall of liver failure. Other fertility centers say they have wrestled with treating patients with H.I.V. One idea, promoted by Dr. Ann Kiessling, a virologist in the Boston area, is to test semen for the virus while men are taking drugs to suppress it. If there is no detectable virus in the semen, it can apparently be safely used for insemination, she said. Dr. Kiessling founded a company, Duncan Holly Biomedical in Somerville, Mass., to provide the testing.
''All recognize that the age at the first period, which I think is the most critical event, has not changed, which would suggest to me that the tempo of puberty has not changed,'' said Dr. Edward Reiter, president of the Lawson-Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society and a pediatric endocrinologist at Baystate Medical Center Children's Hospital in Massachusetts. Dr. Benita Katzenellenbogen, president of the Endocrine Society and a professor at the University of Illinois, said she worried that serious medical conditions, like tumors and hormonal disorders, that can cause early sexual development might be missed if pediatricians simply assumed that it was normal for girls to start puberty at a very early age. ''It really is an important issue,'' she said. The new statement was applauded by some pediatric endocrinologists, who had been deeply concerned that the public and many pediatricians had decided that it was a settled fact that girls were now starting puberty as early as first grade and that there was no need to worry about such early sexual development.
The advertisements started appearing last week in newspapers at the nation's top schools -- Ivy League colleges, Stanford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the California Institute of Technology. ''Egg Donor Needed,'' the advertisements said, adding, ''Large Financial Incentive.'' The advertisements called for a 5-foot-10, athletic woman who had scored at least 1400 on her Scholastic Achievement Test and who had no major family medical problems. In return for providing eggs, she would receive $50,000. Already, more than 200 women have responded to what is believed to be the largest amount of money offered for a woman's eggs. Darlene Pinkerton, who with her lawyer-husband, Thomas Pinkerton, placed the advertisement on behalf of an infertile couple, said that most respondents were from Ivy League institutions and that she was starting to get calls from women in countries as far away as Finland and New Zealand. Women from state colleges and universities are calling, Ms. Pinkerton said, as are women who are too short or whose S.A.T. scores are too low.
''If you have a good source of vitamin A in your food and you take a supplement with another 100 percent, you can easily reach a level that can accumulate'' to one associated with increased risk of osteoporosis, Dr. Caballero said. Dr. Dickinson said that multivitamin manufacturers were decreasing the vitamin A in their products, but that it might take a year for the reformulated products to appear. Others warn about overdosing on other vitamins and minerals. Dr. Richard J. Wood, director of the mineral bioavailability laboratory at Tufts, worries about iron overload, which can increase the risk of heart disease. In a large federal research effort, the Framingham study, Dr. Wood found that 12 percent of the elderly participants had worrisome levels. ''Hardly anyone had iron deficiency anemia,'' he said. ''But 16 percent were taking iron-containing supplements.'' While readily noting that the proof of a benefit is not in, some researchers said they took multivitamins. They agree with Dr. Joann E. Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who takes a multivitamin and recommends it to patients whose diets seem imbalanced.
The drug had a serious side effect -- it could cause potentially life-threatening bleeding in the brain in about 6 percent of patients. But the clinical trial demonstrated that the drug's benefits outweighed its risks. When the study's results were announced, Dr. James Grotta of the University of Texas Medical School at Houston expressed the researchers' elation. ''Until today, stroke was an untreatable disease,'' Dr. Grotta said. But the expected sea change did not occur. One problem was that patients showed up too late. Many had no choice. Strokes often occur in the morning when people are sleeping. They awake with terrifying symptoms, paralyzed on one side or unable to speak. ''That's the challenge -- we have to ask the patient'' when the stroke began, said Dr. A. Gregory Sorensen, a co-director of the Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital. ''If they don't know or can't talk, we're out of luck.''
''We can't just throw up our hands and say, 'We tried,' '' Dr. Haskell said. He is convinced that one reason people are getting fatter is because they are so sedentary and because they don't know it, with many thinking they are moving more than they really are. Dr. Haskell and others are undeterred, determined to keep trying to find a way to change Americans' exercise habits. ''Physical activity is as close as we've come to a magic bullet for good health,'' Dr. Manson said. ''It's more difficult than popping a pill, but it's worth it.''
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that its widely publicized estimate that 400,000 Americans die each year from being too fat is wrong and that it will submit a new, lower figure to the medical journal that published its original estimate last March. It will be a simple correction of an inadvertent calculation error, the centers said. But that figure of 400,000 deaths has taken on a life of its own. Those concerned about obesity cite it to show that being fat is almost as bad as smoking. And tobacco opponents attack the number, saying it is grossly, possibly purposely, inflated. Yesterday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the centers planned to revise the estimate and had undertaken an internal review of the study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The estimate originated with an effort by the C.D.C. to determine the effects of the nation's growing number of overweight and obese people.
Suppose there were an anti-inflammatory drug that sharply reduced the level of CRP, the protein that has proved to be as powerful an indicator of heart disease risk as high cholesterol. A doctor might well prescribe such a drug for a patient with high levels of the protein. After all, CRP is linked to inflammation, and high levels of it are linked to heart attacks. As it turns out, there are such drugs. But this may not be good news. The anti-inflammatory drugs that lower CRP levels are COX-2 inhibitors, the very drugs that were recently found to increase the risk of heart attacks. For example, Vioxx, which was pulled from the market in late September because of those risks, had been found in a study just a month earlier to cut CRP levels in half, from the danger zone to a level considered excellent. Celebrex, still on the market but linked to an increased risk of heart attack, has also been found to lower CRP levels.
After reviewing thousands of papers and documents submitted by scientists, implant makers and groups representing women who had implants, the group reached a unanimous consensus: the primary safety concern with implants is their tendency to cause local complications like infections, pain and scarring and the possibility that women might have to have second or even subsequent operations as a consequence. The committee chairman, Dr. Stuart Bondurant, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, said the group heard women tell them in testimony and letters that they had not known that their implants could cause local problems. ''One of the notable things they told us is that they were told the implants would last a lifetime,'' Dr. Bondurant said. While emphasizing that that is the women's recollection, he noted that there were never any data to support such an assertion. Dr. Virginia Ernster, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California at San Francisco, said that the best she could do in assessing the published data on the complications of implants was to come up with a range of risks.
Their prognosis is not good. Mild cognitive impairment may be caused by other disorders, especially depression. But when no such cause is found, it has been shown in studies to lead to full-blown Alzheimer's, with its additional impairments in reasoning and thinking, in at least 80 percent of cases. Patients with mild cognitive impairment progress to Alzheimer's at a rate of 12 percent to 15 percent a year, the studies show; for people of similar ages without mild cognitive impairment, the rate is about 1 percent a year. Nothing has been shown to slow brain cell death. But doctors and patients alike say the new diagnosis holds one other bright spot: it is giving a new, first-person voice to Alzheimer's, allowing patients to talk about the disease before it robs them of the ability to understand that they have it. ''The problem with dementia has always been that it is so foreign and so frightening that the impulse is to recoil from it,'' said Dr. Alan Dienstag, who coordinates psychology research for the New York chapter of the Alzheimer's Association.
Last December, scientists appointed by the judge overseeing implant liability litigation, Sam C. Pointer Jr., of Federal District Court in Alabama, came to a similar conclusion as the Institute panel and as a report issued last July by scientists in Britain who had been charged by the British minister of health with reviewing implant safety. Scientists appointed by Judge Robert E. Jones of Federal District Court in Oregon, reached a comparable conclusion. Meanwhile, Dow Corning, a subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company, which filed for bankruptcy citing the burden of its breast implant litigation, has agreed to pay women $3.2 billion to settle their claims. Other implant manufacturers, Baxter International, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and 3M, have agreed to a total settlement estimated to be nearly $4 billion. In addition, thousands of women have settled their cases in private agreements with implant makers or gone to trial and won awards that reached millions of dollars.
She said Afghans have a reputation as the dumbest dogs around, but that is just because they are ''very aloof,'' more like a cat than a dog. ''They are sweet and affectionate. If you have one you can never go back.''
The middle-aged people born during the famine also say they just do not feel well. Twice as many rated their health as poor, 10 percent compared with 5 percent of those born before or after the famine. ''We asked them whether they felt healthy,'' Dr. Roseboom said. ''The answer to that tends to be highly predictive of future mortality.'' But not everyone was convinced by what has come to be known as the Barker hypothesis, the idea that events very early in life affect health and well-being in middle and old age. One who looked askance was Douglas V. Almond, an economist at Columbia University. Dr. Almond had a problem with the studies. They were not of randomly selected populations, he said, making it hard to know if other factors had contributed to the health effects. He wanted to see a rigorous test -- a sickness or a deprivation that affected everyone, rich and poor, educated and not, and then went away. Then he realized there had been such an event: the 1918 flu.
By contrast, in earlier studies, researchers had no good way of knowing what drugs people had taken. Some studies with patients suggested that anti-inflammatories prevented Alzheimer's, whereas others did not. Studies in the laboratory and in animals had also suggested that anti-inflammatory drugs prevented Alzheimer's disease or delayed its onset. Alzheimer's disease experts say that clinical trials that may confirm or refute the Dutch study will be completed soon. In one study supported by the National Institute on Aging, people who already have Alzheimer's disease are taking either dummy pills or anti-inflammatory drugs to see whether the drugs can slow the progression of the disease. The researchers will have an answer by the middle of 2002, said Dr. Neil Buckholtz, chief of the Dementias of Aging branch at the institute. Another study, also supported by the institute, involves healthy people 70 or older with family histories of Alzheimer's. Those subjects, too, are taking anti-inflammatories or dummy pills. That study will take at least five more years, Dr. Buckholtz said.
Jerry Gordon, a 52-year-old Philadelphia record producer, says he knows the stigma. Five feet four inches tall and 220 pounds, Mr. Gordon has struggled with his weight his whole life, trying countless diets. But the pounds always came back. For the past year he has been on a low-calorie diet as part of a clinical trial. At first, he dropped 45 pounds, but he has regained 9. Mr. Gordon says he has felt the impact of the moral crusade. ''People have become so self-righteous,'' he says. Friends and even casual acquaintances have offered advice. ''I get people saying, 'Hey, you ought to exercise more. You ought to go to the gym,''' Mr. Gordon said. ''Do they think people will say, 'Gee, thanks for telling me I'm overweight -- I didn't realize it?''' A news conference in December 2001 had all the trappings of a major event. Dr. David Satcher, the surgeon general, announced that two-thirds of Americans were overweight or obese.
''Now that they found this difference in incidence rates,'' Dr. Buckholtz said, ''the question is why.''
As a result, some doctors who could administer the drug may choose not to do so. Spokesmen at health agencies in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said yesterday that it was not clear if their states had laws that might restrict access to the pill or require guidelines for doctors who prescribed it. Janet Benshoof, the president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, a legal advocacy organization that has represented abortion clinics, said, ''Any doctor who regularly does abortions in most states has been subjected to extra scrutiny from law enforcement -- they don't fool around with this.'' Ms. Benshoof said that in many states the laws written for surgical abortions also applied to pill-induced abortions. ''Despite mifepristone's great potential to improve medical services for women, anti-abortion state legislatures have already erected a labyrinth of laws restricting all abortion,'' Ms. Benshoof said. Mifepristone was first synthesized 20 years ago, in France, and came on the market in Europe more than a decade ago. But from the beginning its introduction into the United States was entangled in abortion politics.
At this point, Dr. Greenough said, ''the important thing to realize is that going from basic science to effective clinical treatment is a pathway that invariably has many steps.'' ''This is a really big step along this pathway,'' he added, but there is still a long way to go.
''The idea was, when a state changed compulsory schooling from, say, six years to seven years, would the people who were forced to go to school for six years live as long as the people the next year who had to go for seven years,'' Dr. Lleras-Muney asked. All she would have to do was to go back and find the laws in the different states and then use data from the census to find out how long people lived before and after the law in each state was changed. ''I was very excited for about three seconds,'' she says. Then she realized how onerous it could be to comb through the state archives. But when her analysis was finished, Dr. Lleras-Muney says, ''I was surprised, I was really surprised.'' It turned out that life expectancy at age 35 was extended by as much as one and a half years simply by going to school for one extra year.
So perhaps it's a good thing that few people seem to assess their weigh based on the B.M.I. On one hand, ''almost no women think they are skinny,'' Dr. Flegal. On the other, she said, only 42 percent of men with a B.M.I. of 25 think they are overweight.
So far, Medicare and other insurers do not generally pay for the CT scans to screen the colon, but that is expected to change as the technology improves. With a CT scan, as with colonoscopies, patients have to take powerful laxatives ahead of time to cleanse their bowels. But for the actual test, they simply lie down and hold their breath for about 10 seconds, exhale, then hold their breath again while a scanner X-rays their colons, creating detailed, three-dimensional images. With traditional colonoscopy, patients are sedated while a doctor threads a long tube into the colon. It takes about half an hour to examine the colon's walls. Then the patients wait in a recovery room for about an hour as the sedative wears off. Of course, if CT scans or other screening methods replace colonoscopy, the very nature of gastroenterologists' practice will be altered, said Dr. Timothy Cragin Wang, chief of the division of digestive and liver diseases at Columbia University Medical Center and the chairman of the gastroenterological association's committee. And, he added, ''obviously it has economic consequences.''
''I said, 'Well, hell yes they were thin. But were they healthy?' '' It is likely that they were poor, malnourished and sick from the coal dust, he added. No wonder they were thin. ''It really got me thinking about, gosh, have we gotten so out of touch?'' Dr. Williamson said. Obesity, he said, is a very legitimate concern, but it is not the only health risk. And being thin does not necessarily equate with being healthy.
The first lifesaving decision was to go to a hospital soon after his chest pain began. But the miscalculation was to call his friend for a ride. He should have called an ambulance. Had his friend gotten caught in traffic, Mr. Orr might have been dead or sustained serious injury to his heart. He might have had to go to a rehabilitation center and learn special tactics for conserving energy, like sliding a coffeepot along a counter instead of lifting it. What few patients realize, Dr. Antman said, is that a serious heart attack is as much of an emergency as being shot. ''We deal with it as if it is a gunshot wound to the heart,'' Dr. Antman said. Cardiologists call it the golden hour, that window of time when they have a chance to save most of the heart muscle when an artery is blocked. But that urgency, cardiologists say, has been one of the most difficult messages to get across, in part because people often deny or fail to appreciate the symptoms of a heart attack. The popular image of a heart attack is all wrong.
Others said that the analysis itself was flawed and that Dr. Gotzsche and Mr. Olsen had arbitrarily discarded data from major studies whose conclusions did not fit with their notion that mammography was not working. In the meantime, the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society reiterated their positions that women should start having regular mammograms at age 40 because, they said, the test saves lives. In February, Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, held a news conference to announce the Preventive Services Task Force's conclusion that mammography was beneficial starting at 40. Yet the questioning continued in medical circles, with researchers publishing dueling articles, analyses and editorials in medical journals and holding debates at meetings. As the papers in the current issue of The Annals indicate, there are no signs that the dispute will soon be settled. Dr. Steven H. Woolf, a task force member, said the message he wanted to convey in his group's analysis was that ''there is clearly a mortality benefit with mammography,'' and he said the benefit increased as women grew older. In its paper, the group took note of what that benefit might be, and what the risks might be. It wrote that with mammography, the breast cancer death rate was reduced by about 16 percent. That meant that if 1,224 women were screened, one death might be prevented after 14 years.
Two months after the soldiers died, an obese woman died when the flu swept through her isolated Alaskan village. She was buried in a mass grave, along with 72 other adults -- virtually all of the adults who lived there. Dr. Johan V. Hultin, a retired pathologist from San Francisco, unearthed the woman's still-frozen body about a year and a half ago and sent samples of her lungs to Dr. Taubenberger for his analysis.
Opponents say the over-the-counter rule would be an invitation to medical nightmares, with some people, particularly teenagers, using the pills repeatedly and not telling anyone even if they have complications. The safety of repeated use has not been well studied. Also, opponents say, women opposed to abortion who believe that pregnancy begins at fertilization may not realize they may be preventing an egg from implanting. Among the groups in favor of selling the pills without prescriptions are the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American Academy of Pediatrics and Planned Parenthood. Opponents include the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Concerned Women for America and 44 members of Congress, including the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, who asked the members of the F.D.A. advisory committee to vote no on the over-the-counter application. One large anti-abortion group, the National Right to Life Committee, has not taken a position.
''I would call it, at this stage, interesting leads,'' Dr. Blair said. ''None are large enough for any regulatory agency to take action or to say they are a human carcinogen. They are leads.'' They include, for example, a slightly higher rate of lung cancer and leukemia in farmers who used the insecticide diazinon and a possible increase in prostate cancer among farmers who used methylbromide to fumigate the soil. The investigators looked for an association between pesticides and herbicides and breast cancer, but they did not find one, Dr. Blair said, adding that one pesticide, atrazine, was under particular suspicion because it causes breast cancer in rats and has estrogenlike properties. Even if the study finds that some chemicals have increased farmers' cancer rates, it remains unclear what that means for the general population, where exposures are usually much lower. Also unclear is whether those chemicals should be banned.
''All the old warriors were there,'' Dr. La Montagne recalled. But, they agreed, the list of possible diseases was short, for several reasons, among the most important of which was the requirement that the human disease be unique to humans, with no animal host. ''If you have an animal reservoir, unless you eradicate it in the animal, you can't eradicate it,'' explained Dr. Frederick C. Robbins, a virologist and Nobel laureate who is professor emeritus at Case Western Reserve University. That means, Dr. La Montagne added, that flu is not a likely candidate for eradication. ''There are so many flu viruses in animal species,'' he said, with viruses infecting birds, pigs, horses -- even ferrets. Some experts at the meeting 20 years ago suggested polio as a target. Like a few other diseases, measles and syphilis among them, it infects only humans. And there is a vaccine. But, Dr. Robbins said, polio still proved ''a tougher one than smallpox.''
Dr. Masliah proposed another hypothesis. ''I thought probably something was going wrong at the level of the connections between the brain cells,'' he said, reasoning that if the system was not working properly, it might be because the communications between the nerve cells were failing. Those connections, the synapses, which link the cells in complex networks, might be damaged. But his work was not widely accepted at the time. Why, colleagues asked, were the synapses failing? Was there a link between synaptic damage and dementia? Did it explain the lack of correlation between plaques and the degree of dementia? In the next decade, other scientists began finding small molecules that, they proposed, might be the culprits in damaging nerve cells. The molecules seemed to be clumps of amyloid protein, Dr. Mucke said, and a new picture was emerging. These small amyloid clumps, he said, ''do not just exist in these garbage piles, the plaques, but they also float around like cruise missiles.'' When they do, they might injure synapses.
The other methods include sigmoidoscopy, which costs only a few hundred dollars and does not require sedation. But it examines only the lower half of the colon, where most cancers arise, and it must be repeated every five years. Patients can have barium enemas, which cost several hundred dollars and must be repeated every five years. They are not as effective as colonoscopies and sigmoidoscopies in finding polyps. The fourth choice is a fecal occult blood test, which costs about $20 and looks for traces of blood in stool that can arise when polyps ooze blood. Since it misses many polyps, it should be repeated every year or two. Rigorous studies show that it reduces the colon cancer death rate, although doctors believe the other tests have the same effect. ''It's important that we be working on new approaches to colorectal cancer screening because we have low adherence rates,'' Dr. Rex said. ''As you have more options, you may have something that will appeal to everyone.''
A similar problem occurs with cystic fibrosis, another of the 10 diseases, Dr. Kaback said. One child will be severely ill, and his brother, who inherited exactly the same disease-causing genes, may have nothing wrong except, perhaps, the absence of the vas deferens, which carries sperm from the testes. Ms. Dubler, not overly concerned, said: ''It's not that complicated. We have taught people about health issues that are much more difficult. It's a matter of finding the messages that people listen to most easily and the metaphors. We can do that.''
But medical experts have had many good ideas. The real question is, Do they work? After several years of testing some of these ideas, researchers now have evidence that they not only can greatly alleviate irritations felt by doctors and patients, but they can also save substantial amounts of money. Based on the early results, some medical groups across the nation are starting to incorporate the innovations, as are the national health services of England and Sweden. A Boston-based nonprofit organization, the Institute for Health Care Improvement, has formed a national coalition of 23 medical centers that are putting a variety of the ideas on improving care into practice and gathering data on their effectiveness. But even the most enthusiastic proponents readily admit that they face real hurdles. Many doctors have not heard of the new methods and even some who have hesitate to use them because of worries about how to bill insurance companies. And yet, supporters say, the benefits can be overwhelming.
For now, said Dr. Steven DeKosky, who directs the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh, the Dutch study is encouraging. ''This is solid circumstantial evidence,'' Dr. DeKosky said. ''It is probably the strongest evidence so far that anti-inflammatory drugs can quiet things down perhaps enough to delay the onset of the disorder. ''Now it's up to the clinical trials to show us whether or not they are an effective prevention or an effective treatment strategy.''
Nonetheless, Dr. Berry said, when the P.D.Q. last discussed mammography, in 2002, the concern was that the risks were clear but that the benefits uncertain. ''This makes the benefits more certain,'' he said.
For some common illnesses, there may be no difference in outcomes between community hospitals and academic medical centers, ones that are connected to medical schools and that serve as referral centers for patients with the most complicated, difficult cases. For heart surgery, what matters appears to be the surgeon's experience, not the number of such patients at the hospital. But for some cancers, the important factor seems to be the total number of patients with that cancer at a hospital, not the number any particular surgeon sees. Everyone agrees that medical statistics are not the only issue. People want to like and trust their doctors. And with a community hospital, patients have the convenience of staying close to home and may be more likely to receive warm, personal care. That was an important consideration for Mary Bruce Buchanan, a 60-year-old retired real estate broker from Flemington, N.J., whose decision about where to go for cancer care went against her own upbringing. Her father, a surgeon, had trained at the University of Pennsylvania and, she said, ''when anything was really wrong, that was where you went.''
The study on birth defects, several fertility experts noted, contradicts results from other studies that did not find such an effect. Dr. Mitchell said, however, that the assessment of birth defects had many problems. He praised the Australian study, which overcame difficulties in many previous ones.
And if good health and nutrition early in life are major factors in determining health in middle and old age, that bodes well for middle-aged people today. Investigators predict that they may live longer and with less pain and misery than any previous generation. ''Will old age for today's baby boomers be anything like the old age we think we know?'' Dr. Barker asked. ''The answer is no.'' Trying to Change a Pattern Craig Keller does not know what to expect of his old age. But he is optimistic by nature, and he knows he has already lived past the life span of his beleaguered ancestor Valentin. He is 5-foot-9, 200 pounds and exuberantly healthy. He grew up in Hamilton, the same town on the Kentucky border where Valentin lived, worshiped and was buried. And he still lives there, working as a court bailiff, married to Sandy, whom he met when they were in second grade. Now, married 25 years, the Kellers have two grown daughters, a lively black dog and no complaints.
''The fact that she isn't there any more will be brought home to us when we go near that barn and she's not there,'' he said. ''She's been a friendly face of science,'' Dr. Wilmut said. ''She was a very friendly animal that was part of a big scientific breakthrough.'' He said he had no plans to clone Dolly. ''There are lots of reasons why we would be slightly curious,'' he said. ''But our priority has been to move along, to try to understand what happens during cloning, to try to make it more effective.'' Besides, he said, because genes interact with the environment, ''if we did clone her, it wouldn't be the same sheep.'' Dolly lived her entire life at the Roslin Institute where she was born on July 5, 1996. She entered the world head and forelegs first, weighing an unsurprising -- for a lamb -- 14.5 pounds.
The screening changed that. Now, Dr. Ostrer said, the number of babies in the United States with Tay-Sachs has dropped, from 50 a year to 5, and most of those are born to couples who are not Jewish and but happen to have the mutated gene. Many scientists assumed that the next steps would be straightforward. Just find the genes for the other major recessive diseases in the Ashkenazim, and those diseases, too, would die with screening. The genes were found. In some cases, parents of affected children raised the research money themselves. But, said Dr. Susan J. Gross, a geneticist at Montefiore and Albert Einstein, which began a Tay-Sachs program in the 70's, nothing happened. Dr. Gross and others watched with dismay as babies continued to be born to couples who had no idea that they carried aberrant genes. Doctors were either unaware of the tests or were not offering them to their patients. Jews were unaware that they were at risk or did not ask for or receive testing.
Dr. Goodwin said that had also been a problem in Canada, explaining: ''There were some women who came to us and said, 'I must have a support group.' We tried to educate them and said, 'There's no clear evidence.' '' Some were persuaded but others, she said, were not. In the end, however, the Canadian investigators recruited enough women so that statistically they would have seen a survival effect if there had been one. They also made sure that the weekly support groups were run according to Dr. Spiegel's specifications. ''We had Spiegel come and train all of our leaders,'' Dr. Goodwin said. ''He came back every year to make sure we were doing it right and he said we faithfully replicated his intervention.'' Dr. Goodwin said that rather than being disappointed by the results, she saw them as liberating. She explained: ''The way I would interpret the results is that women are now free to make a choice. They don't need to feel they have to participate in a group to be doing everything they can to prolong their survival.''
Dr. Clarke said that they had data through 2004 and so could ask whether the decrease in cancer incidence in 2003 continued the next year. It did, she said, although it slowed somewhat, as might be expected. The investigators found that the breast cancer incidence fell even more in California than in the rest of the country -- the overall drop was 11 percent in 2003, compared with 7 percent nationally. And, Dr. Clarke said, more women in California also had been using hormone therapy than women in other states. Kaiser Permanente's prescriptions for hormone combinations like Prempro fell by two-thirds in 2003 and prescriptions for estrogen alone dropped by one-third, Dr. Clarke and her colleagues reported. (Estrogen without progestin can cause cancer of the uterine lining so should only be used by women whose uteruses have been removed. While there is some question about whether estrogen alone increases breast cancer risk, the Women's Health Initiative did not find such an effect.)
Participants in the study did not grow stronger, even though they gained muscle, but it is possible that that might change if the treatment continues longer, said Dr. Harman, who also helped direct the study. Dr. Harman noted that when the hormone was given to people with rare medical conditions who lacked it, ''you see very little increase in muscle strength until a year.'' Dr. Blackman was cautious. ''I personally believe these data are quite exciting,'' he said. ''But there are two issues that are the bottom line. One is that we are uncertain about the possible effects and their functional relevance -- getting out of a car, being able to bathe. The other is that there needs to be a lot more research with larger numbers of people and a reduction of these adverse effects.'' Dr. Michael Thorner, chairman of the department of medicine at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, said the recent fall from grace of hormone therapy in menopause should give people pause. ''If you just advocate that growth hormone be used because it might help,'' Dr. Thorner said, ''the next thing you know, the whole world is on it. I think in medicine one should tailor therapies based on evidence.''
Then there are the controversial methods that some doctors promote: Viagra suppositories to increase blood flow to the uterus, ''embryo glue'' to attach embryos to the uterine wall, and a variety of immunological tests based on extrapolations from other medical conditions. Still, in a field where success is intermittent and unpredictable, some fertility experts find themselves with nagging doubts about methods that seem irrational. ''The problem that I have, the problem that those of us who are honest have, is constant self-doubt,'' said Dr. Richard Paulson of the University of Southern California. ''There's always that 1 percent element of doubt. What if this guy really has tripped upon the next new thing?'' That possibility, of course, also draws patients, many of whom sought controversial approaches only after they tried and failed with standard therapies. Ms. Todd's journey began in the most straightforward way, with drugs that elicit ovulation. They had worked for her before: at 29, she had her first baby, becoming pregnant the first month she tried, with the aid of Clomid, a drug that stimulates ovulation.
A postdoctoral student at the Philpott Institute in Cambridge, Mass., has an astonishing result: a virus he engineered seems to cure breast cancer in mice. Now the two lab directors, cautious Marion Mendelssohn and politically savvy Sandy Glass are arguing about what to do. Dr. Mendelssohn wants to take her time and make sure the results are correct before discussing them; Dr. Glass wants to make his move now, before a competitor hears about his work and beats him to it. ''We can wait until we've dotted every 'i' and crossed each 't,' '' Dr. Glass tells her. ''We can wait until we reproduce it all and submit it to Nature. We can make sure every research note coming from the lab is of archival quality. Or we can seize the moment now. We can announce results that are still preliminary.'' ''Results that may be incorrect,'' Dr. Mendelssohn replies. ''Right,'' says Dr. Glass. ''We can risk that they're incorrect and stake our claim before someone else does.''
Now, patients whose impairment is still relatively mild are starting to tell their stories, he said. ''We're on the cusp of seeing a really substantial change,'' he added. Dr. Petersen, of the Mayo Clinic, says mild cognitive impairment was discovered almost by accident. His group was studying patients who came in for routine care, looking for those who had complained, or whose family members or doctors had noticed, that they were getting forgetful. The Mayo Clinic doctors studied these patients and discovered that their memory impairment was very specific -- their only problem was remembering experiences of the last few minutes or hours or days. In a typical test for mild cognitive impairment, a patient is asked to repeat a string of unrelated words. The tester goes on to ask other questions: multiply 5 by 13, name the first president and the current president. At the end, the patient is asked to recall the unrelated words.
Federal rules required Mr. Wenzell to take an exercise stress test. He knew he would never pass. He had had one artery opened with angioplasty, but the other remained fully blocked and required bypass surgery. So did he see a surgeon right away? No way. ''I thought I'd exercise myself out of it,'' he said. That, of course, did not work, as his doctor had warned him. Finally, he ended up in the office of Dr. Robert E. Michler, the chief of cardiothoracic surgery and transplantation at Ohio State University Medical Center in Columbus. Dr. Michler was dismayed but not surprised by Mr. Wenzell's attempts to take his serious medical problems into his own hands. Men, he says, are like that. ''It's a denial response, a proactive response,'' Dr. Michler said. ''It's their body, and they know how to adjust their body.'' Instead, he explained, they end up on the operating table -- or worse.
Some consumer groups are wary and some industry groups said they wanted to be sure consumers would accept milk or meat from clones or clone offspring. Public interest groups are weighing in and the F.D.A. will hold a public meeting to air the issue. It expects to decide by next spring whether to regulate food from animal clones. What changed? Cloning methods, for one. The clones in 1988 were made from embryos -- scientists would breed a prize cow or bull, freeze some of the embryos and let a few go to term. Then they would examine the calves to see if the animals were what they wanted. If so, they would go back to the frozen embryos and clone them, making multiple copies that were clones of the embryo clones, and letting them go to term. Today, scientists start with adult animals, making clones from adult cells. Like the embryo clones, the clones made from adult cells start out as embryos and are gestated in surrogate mothers. Cloning of adults is less likely to succeed than cloning of embryos, but the methodology is much the same.
TO many, the good life may be lying on a hammock strung between palm trees, sipping a long cool drink, doing nothing, planning nothing, worrying about nothing. But the latest scientific research offers more evidence that this version of the the good life and good health may not be the same thing. Of course, the research is preliminary and involves mostly insects and rodents, but some experts, like Dr. Mark Mattson, chief of the laboratory of neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging in Baltimore, are taking no chances. He has been on a low-calorie diet for 20 years, starting when he was a 26-year-old graduate student. He skips breakfast and eats a meager lunch, concentrating the semi-starvation effects into one discrete period. Then he consumes a more normal dinner. He is 5-foot-9 and weighs 120 pounds. He also exercises each morning. His goal is to subject his body to daily low-level stress -- like abstaining from food for much of the day. ''Stress is a very ill-defined term, and there's clearly bad types of stress,'' Dr. Mattson said. ''It is very clear that uncontrollable chronic stress and psychological stress is bad for the brain and the body.'' But, he and others say, mild stress is a very different, beneficial thing.
Dr. Nicholas A. Christakis, tall, animated, and impassioned, burns with a mission: to bring prognosis into what he sees as its rightful place in medicine. A 38-year-old associate professor of sociology and medicine at the University of Chicago, Dr. Christakis does research on how well doctors do in predicting their patients' outcomes and on how well they do in helping dying patients spend their remaining time without pain and among their family members. But he also is a hospice doctor, caring for dying patients living at home on the South Side of Chicago, and so he has seen firsthand what happens when doctors' prognoses are wrong and they tell patients who have little time left that there is no rush to write a will or to send for far-flung relatives or to enter a hospice. Dr. Christakis spoke from his office at the university.  Q. At a time when most of medicine seems to be focused on diagnosis and treatment, you are ardent about prognosis. You have written a book, ''Death Foretold: Prophecy and Prognosis in Medicine,'' and you have lamented what you say is a neglect of prognosis in medicine. What makes you think that prognosis is overlooked or avoided in the medical profession today?  A. There are three things that doctors are supposed to do. They are supposed to diagnose disease. They are supposed to treat disease. And they are supposed to predict its outcome. If you think about it, treatment and prognosis are alternative ways that doctors can cope with illness.
In doctors' offices and in women's homes, however, it is more than a question of numbers. Many women have no problems stopping the hormones and see no reason to continue taking them: they feel fine or, at worst, have mild symptoms of menopause, like warm flushes that are not disabling, for a few months. While it is unclear how many women fall into that category, Dr. Deborah Grady, who directs the University of California San Francisco/ Mount Zion Women's Health Clinical Research Center, says studies of prescription use indicate that half of the women who start taking the hormones are no longer renewing their prescriptions a year later. For some, however, stopping is not an easy option. Ms. Kipfer began taking the hormone combination in April 1991, when she was 44. ''I was going through incredible hot flashes and could not get a good night's sleep,'' she said. Two years later, when she had an X-ray for other reasons, a doctor noticed that the bones in her back looked thin, as if she had osteoporosis. She went to Dr. J. Christopher Gallagher, an osteoporosis expert at Creighton University, who confirmed the other doctor's suspicions: her spine had 18 percent less bone than was normal for her age. He discovered that she was continuing to lose bone on the usual dose of estrogen, .625 milligrams a day, so he increased her dose to .9 milligrams a day.
''Unfortunately,'' she said, ''in monkeys, that's all we have to show.'' Science
Dr. Hwang said he had no intention of using the method to produce babies that were clones. ''Our proposal is limited to finding a way to cure disease,'' he said. ''That is our proposal and our research goal.'' Previously, the same group produced a single stem cell line from a cloned embryo, but the process was so onerous that many scientists said it was not worth trying to repeat it, and some doubted that the South Koreans' report was even correct. Things have changed. The new finding buoyed researchers who had wanted to use such stem cells to study diseases but had thought it would be years, if ever, before it would be practical to obtain them. ''It is a tremendous advance,'' said Dr. Leonard Zon, a stem cell researcher at Harvard Medical School and the president of the International Society for Stem Cell Research, who was not involved in the research.
It is the increasing risk of conditions like heart disease and diabetes that come with higher weight that makes fighting fat a public health priority, according to Tom Skinner, a C.D.C. spokesman. ''We would really be remiss if we didn't continue to mount a full-court press,'' he said. But the idea of an epidemic, some critics say, is in the financial interest of weight loss centers, supplement makers, drug companies and purveyors of diet books and diet programs. And the alarm can also benefit many scientists, who get research grants to study the problem and who often serve as consultants to drug companies or run weight loss centers at their universities. A sense of crisis can also help government agencies get additional funds from Congress. ''Obesity works across the board -- that's a big part of it, and that's what's fascinating about it, '' said Dr. Eric Oliver, a University of Chicago political scientist who is writing a book on the politics of obesity. ''If you are on the political right, obesity is indicative of moral failure,'' he said. ''If you are on the left, it means rampaging global capitalism.''
Ms. Atrubin woke with mild chest pain. Waited a day to call doctor, not wanting to bother him on a Sunday. Doctor sent her to a cardiologist. Tests, including stress echocardiogram and nuclear stress tests, show abnormalities. Angiogram reveals blockage in an artery branch. She declined more stents because her pain was not that bad. 2007  CURRENT STATUS, AGE 76  TOTAL SUBMITTED SO FAR, IN 2007 DOLLARS $66,737.27 At age 76, Ms. Atrubin gets tired but does not know if it is her heart or insomnia. ''After my heart attacks, I felt like I was cured. I thought I could go ahead and do everything. I don't feel like that now,'' she says. She goes to a gym and walks on a treadmill. And if she had that weak feeling or chest pains again? ''I would like to think I would run like hell to an emergency room. But how tired do I have to feel? I don't really want to be a hypochondriac.''
Dr. Wennberg is the director of Dartmouth's Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences. A 68-year-old professor who specializes in family and community medicine and in public health, he has spent his career studying variations in medical care across the country. But nothing, Dr. Wennberg says, is so counterintuitive as the peculiarities that keep cropping up in the use of medical services. Whether it is the frequency of visits to a doctor or how often people have diagnostic tests or how much time people with chronic diseases spend in intensive care units or how often they are hospitalized, the data are consistent, he says: the greater the supply, the greater the use. If medical care were just another commodity, the opposite would happen, he notes. ''In areas where there are too many doctors it would be like areas where there are too many McDonald's,'' Dr. Wennberg said. Offices would be half-empty, doctors would see fewer patients.
Nonetheless, some medical experts are optimistic. ''These are really intriguing results,'' said Dr. Gregory Stock, who directs the program on medicine, technology and society at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Medicine. The results show that ''there may be ways of eliciting responses from the body that we would not have dared to look for,'' he said. That, however, was furthest from the minds of the scientists who chanced upon regeneration of pancreas cells in mice. The work began, said Dr. Denise Faustman, a diabetes researcher at Harvard, because she was trying to get around a fundamental obstacle to curing Type 1 diabetes. The disease usually occurs in puberty and afflicts an estimated half-million to a million Americans. It occurs because islet cells, the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas, die, almost always because they are attacked by cells of the immune system. But the underlying disease that killed those cells also seems to kill any that are transplanted to replace them.
OF course, the estrogen story is not finished yet. For women with heart disease, most experts would agree with Dr. Nanette Wenger, a cardiologist at Emory University. ''Women with established heart disease should not use estrogen,'' she said. For healthy women, she added, ''the final chapter is not yet written.'' The heart disease story is also a lesson in scientific evidence, experts said. As scientists and the public seize upon indirect evidence for other effects, like the current hope that estrogen may prevent Alzheimer's, they might do well to remember how clear estrogen's effects on the heart once appeared. ''We thought it was very likely that heart disease risk would be reduced and that therefore those most at risk should take estrogen,'' Dr. Grady said. ''Now, I think that's wrong.''
But it is also possible, Dr. Barry said, that the men with very early cancers will reap a greater benefit from the surgery. Most men in the Swedish study did not have P.S.A. screening and, with their cancers found later, they may have spread outside the prostate, invisibly seeding themselves in the bone by the time they began causing symptoms. In that event, removing the prostate would have been futile, although the doctors would not have known it because they had not detected the cancer's microscopic spread. Dr. Walsh said that reducing deaths from prostate cancer is overwhelmingly important, even if the overall death rate did not budge. ''If you've ever seen anyone die from prostate cancer, it's a terrible death,'' he said, explaining that the cancer tends to spread to the bones, making them break. Others said they would like to see a reduction in the overall death rate, especially in men having the operation years before they have symptoms.
Dr. Shalender Bhasin, an endocrinologist at Charles R. Drew University in Los Angeles, says it should not be surprising that people keep taking the drugs. They do build muscle, decrease fat and improve athletic performance. In the meantime, society is sending mixed messages: no one should take steroids, but athletes should be winners and everyone should strive to be muscular. ''There is some degree of denial and hypocrisy with the use of these compounds,'' Dr. Bhasin said. ''We discourage it by punishing a few people now and then to show our displeasure, but we tolerate their use. We haven't taken a stand as a society, and the widespread use of these agents is reflective of our ambivalence.'' A Trend Is Born  Muscles Get Bigger, And So Do Steroids John D. Fair, a competitive weight lifter and historian of weight lifting at Georgia College and State University in Milledgeville, remembers his first foray into the world of pumping iron. He was a senior in high school, 5 feet 11 inches tall and just 129 pounds. He wore layers of shirts to make himself look bulkier. ''The Charles Atlas 97-pound weakling thing is for real. I've been there,'' he said.
''It is making us re-evaluate the whole area,'' Dr. Janet Woodcock, who directs the F.D.A.'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said. ''The real question is, Where do we go from here?'' Dr. Daniel A. Shames, the director of the F.D.A.'s division that evaluates reproductive and Urologic drugs, asked the audience at the conference for guidance. Until now, he said, the agency has accepted data from studies lasting just 12 weeks to show that hormone therapies relieve the symptoms of menopause, with the women being followed for perhaps a year longer to assess the drugs' safety. Now, he said, with the lessons of the Women's Health Initiative, what advice would the experts give? ''Is this adequate?'' Dr. Shames asked. ''If not, what should we do?'' At the same time, researchers at the National Institutes of Health said they must consider whether to sponsor large studies of other therapies for menopause and, if so, which ones to test.
The drug company Merck announced yesterday that it would stop selling its arthritis and pain medication Vioxx, currently taken by close to two million people worldwide, because a new study found that it doubled patients' risk of heart attack and strokes. Vioxx has been a blockbuster for Merck, with sales of $2.5 billion last year, and has been widely marketed as a safe alternative to drugs like aspirin, which can cause ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. The decision to remove the drug from the market, the largest drug recall in history as measured by sales, comes as Merck has been struggling to find new drugs for its aging product line. [Page C1.] Vioxx represented about 11 percent of the company's revenue last year. Merck stock plunged 27 percent yesterday on the news, reducing the company's stock market value by $25 billion and helping pull the Dow Jones industrial average down by 0.6 percent for the day.
Then, about half a century ago, doctors noticed that after a heart attack, CRP flooded the patient's blood, and for a while the protein was used to help diagnose heart attacks. Dr. Ridker's study involved 3,745 patients who had been hospitalized with heart attacks or with severe chest pain from the blocking of coronary arteries and who were then followed for two and a half years. Dr. Ridker said that when the study, sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb, was being planned several years ago, the thought was that it would ask whether moderate statin therapy -- 40 milligrams a day with Pravachol, a Bristol-Myers product -- was as effective in preventing heart attacks as more intense therapy: 80 milligrams a day of Lipitor, a statin made by Pfizer Inc. ''I said, 'This is a good study, but it can be better,''' Dr. Ridker said. He proposed also asking about CRP. Would there be fewer heart attacks and deaths among people in the study with lower levels of the protein?
''It's certainly fair to say that the effects have been modest,'' Dr. Gortmaker said. ''Yet they show you can make a difference.'' For fat children, however, no one really thinks that modest effects will be enough.  And no one has found a way to prevent obesity. That leaves treatment -- providing diets and exercise programs for fat children in the hope of helping them lose weight and keep it off. But there, the most fundamental question arises: which programs work and which children should be treated? Fat Children, Fat Adults Day after day, parents who came to Dr. Whitaker's pediatric clinic would ask him the same questions: Was their fat child destined to be a fat adult? And, if so, was  there anything they could do to prevent it? Dr. Whitaker did not know how to answer. He said he worried about labeling children as abnormally overweight and in need of help, especially when some might very well outgrow their chubbiness if they were simply left alone. On the other hand, he said, he did not want to ignore a problem that might only worsen if the family did nothing.
''I was thrilled by the concept,'' said Dr. Maxine Papadakis of the University of California in San Francisco. But Dr. Papadakis said she worried about the sweeping conclusion about reversing aging. It was a small study, she said, and the men who took part knew who was taking growth hormone and who was not. Dr. Papadakis set out to test growth hormone in 52 healthy men from 70 to 85. She designed the study so that the men did not know if they were taking the drug or a dummy medication. Reporting in 1996, she found that growth hormone slightly increased muscle mass and decreased body fat but, paradoxically, did not make the men stronger. People had claimed it improved their mental clarity, but she found no such effects; if anything, those taking growth hormone did slightly worse on memory tests. They also suffered swollen legs and feet and achy joints, making them so uncomfortable that a quarter taking growth hormone had their doses reduced during the study.
It is true that thinner people tend to be healthier, but studies have found that, biochemically, the formerly fat are like people who are starving: obsessed with food, needing fewer calories to maintain their body weight. Many -- again the issue is with the obese, not those who want to lose a few pounds -- have slow heart rates after they lose weight and always feel cold; women may stop menstruating, even if they are still relatively fat. Is that better or worse than remaining fat? No one knows for sure. Another unknown should weight loss turn out to improve health: How much weight must be lost? Most obese people dream of being thin, but researchers say a more realistic goal is losing just 5 percent to 10 percent of their weight. That is the best that can be achieved in clinical trials lasting a year or two, they say, and over the short term, is associated with lower blood sugar and blood pressure.
In the end, three pregnancies resulted. One ended in a miscarriage, one was carried to term but the puppy died a few weeks later of respiratory failure, and one resulted in Snuppy. Until dog cloning becomes a lot more efficient, few people will be able to afford to clone their pets. Mr. Hawthorne estimated that it would cost more than $1 million to repeat what the South Koreans have done. The market among dog owners might not be much, in any case. Apart from ethical issues, Dr. Cameron said, dogs are like family members. ''My dog is now deceased,'' he said. ''But I wouldn't want to clone Charlie. It would be disrespectful to Charlie and to Charlie II.'' Tina Vogel, an Afghan breeder in Norwalk, Ohio, agreed that cloning a dog ''would be like cloning a person.'' And she is opposed to that. ''If it was meant to be, God would have done it,'' she said.
IT is a question that occurs to almost everyone who becomes seriously ill: Should you go to your local hospital or would you do better if you went to a major medical center? It may mean a long trip when you are ill and it will almost certainly mean seeing doctors who are strangers to you. But what if going to a major medical center makes the difference between life and death? Patients reach different conclusions, based often on gut feelings about a doctor or a hospital. And medical researchers, looking for data, say they are not always certain themselves about how to decide. ''There really is very, very little information,'' says Dr. Elliott S. Fisher, a professor at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, N.H., who studies medical outcomes. ''It's the great weakness of all the efforts to foster consumer engagement in health care decision making.'' But there are a few hints, he and others say, and the answers from the studies so far have sometimes been a surprise.
When her son was 15 months old, she and her husband decided to have another child. This time, however, Clomid did not work. Neither did more powerful ovulation-inducing drugs. So she tried in vitro fertilization, going to an expert, Dr. Zev Rosenwaks of Weill Medical College of Cornell. She was so certain she would become pregnant that she participated in a television show meant to follow a couple from in vitro fertilization through pregnancy and birth. A film crew followed her, but the treatment failed. Ms. Todd tried again with Dr. Rosenwaks, and failed again. Then she heard about Dr. Geoffrey Sher, who owned seven clinics across the country that offered immunological testing and treatments. The idea behind the immunological approach is that some women may fail to become pregnant because their bodies reject the embryos, an extrapolation from studies of women who become pregnant easily but have repeated miscarriages.
Spiral CT scanning is much more sensitive than chest X-rays, and it is possible that it is picking up cancers when they are really curable. On the other hand, cancer experts said, it is also possible that it is picking up tumors that would never have caused a problem, and that patients would have died with them, not of them. It is also possible that, like chest X-rays, spiral CT finds cancers early but does not save lives. Dr. Barnett Kramer, deputy director of the division of cancer prevention at the cancer institute, said more was at stake than medical certainty that patients would be helped. Spiral CT scanning would be enormously expensive. It costs anywhere from $250 to $1,000 for a scan, depending on the hospital offering it, Dr. Kramer said in an interview before today's meeting. He calculated that it would cost $39 billion to screen all smokers and former smokers in the country. And, he added, that does not include the cost of doing biopsies for people whose tumors turn out to be benign and those whose tumors are so indolent that they would never have been life-threatening.
''We could find no evidence to support a causal relationship between the breast implants and any systemic disease,'' Dr. Bondurant said. ''As far as I know there has been no information since the report was written that would materially change the conclusion.'' Dr. Bondurant, who is professor of medicine and dean emeritus at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, added that the committee believed that the lawsuits and wrenching claims of serious illnesses had diverted attention from the problem of complications like ruptures and scarring. The Institute of Medicine recommended that if the drug agency decided to permit implants again, the agency should require a study after the devices were on the market, to glean information on how often such complications occur. That is exactly what Inamed is proposing. Asked if Inamed was worried about being destroyed by lawsuits if it tried to market implants, Ms. Kuhne said no.
The orthodox way to find out is to randomly assign patients to have the lung scanning test, or not, and then compare outcomes. If more people die in the unscreened group, it can be concluded that the test is saving lives. But, Dr. Henschke asks, how many people are going to enroll in such a study? Who would forgo a simple, painless test that could find cancer early? And even if people did agree, would they hold off having a lung scan for more than a decade while the study wound its way to a conclusion? ''Down the line, more and more people are going to be convinced'' of the effectiveness of the test, Dr. Henschke said. ''What do you do when your neighbor has a CT scan and it detects a nodule and the nodule is cured?'' So what Dr. Henschke is planning  is almost scientific apostasy -- a study in which everyone gets a CT scan.
The colon cancer studies published last week involved patients who were at high risk of the cancer. Some were given aspirin, others a placebo. Those who took aspirin had fewer polyps in their colons and rectums a year or two later. While most colon polyps never develop into cancer, almost all colon cancers start as polyps. By preventing polyps, the researchers said, aspirin may be reducing cancer risk. While the colon cancer studies are furthest along, researchers say they are part of a much larger effort that began with chance observations, decades ago, that people with arthritis seemed to have less cancer. The doctors knew that many people with arthritis took aspirin and they wondered if it might be having an anticancer effect. Researchers still cannot say for sure why aspirin or the other drugs that have similar effects might work against cancer. Perhaps, they say, their ability to reduce inflammation is important. Or the drugs may be reducing DNA damage, preventing mutations that turn a normal cell into a cancerous one. Another possibility is that they prevent tumors from growing a blood supply.
Yet, if people know that a drug can solve their problem, how much incentive is there to change their diet and exercise patterns? ''The behaviorists say that if you have a medication available, you can hang up the idea that the patients will try lifestyle,'' Dr. Nathan said. Still, he said, ''as a realist, it seems to me that the truth is that whatever your thoughts are on the importance of self-control and willpower and profligacy, and that we shouldn't be such pigs, that we should exercise more, the truth is that we are what we are.'' Dr. Nathan added, ''We have recognized that although lifestyle can be miraculously effective, it often isn't, because people won't change.'' PROSPECTS
For now, said Dr. Sean Tunis, the chief medical officer at the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, ''nobody has a good estimate on how big this population of patients is.'' Complicating the issue are other similarly expensive procedures that are on the horizon or have been approved recently. For example, Medicare is to decide next month on devices for patients with congestive heart failure, whose hearts are so damaged they can barely pump. The devices, known as L.V.A.D.'s, for left ventricular assist devices, can help failing hearts pump. Dr. Annetine Gelijins and Dr. Alan Moscowitz of Columbia University, who did an economic analysis, said they expected about 5,000 Medicare patients a year to get the devices at first, but that as many as 60,000 have heart damage so severe that they might need them. At $60,000 per device, and with an additional $150,000 in hospitalization charges, the price for L.V.A.D.'s could range from $1.05 billion to $12.6 billion a year.
Across the nation, hospitals and doctors' offices are returning blood pressure cuffs to their manufacturers to comply with a federal environmental initiative to cut down on the use of mercury, a toxic metal that can pollute the air and water when disposed of improperly. But leading medical experts, joined by the American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, say the mercury gauges are being replaced by newer devices that may be unreliable, and they warn that inaccuracies may be leading to false diagnoses and inappropriate treatments. Nobody knows how many hospitals and doctors have abandoned the old blood pressure cuffs. Nor is it known how well the newer devices are performing. Anecdotal evidence from doctors suggests that erroneous pressure readings have caused illness and death, but some medical centers, including the Mayo Clinic, say other devices have been reliable. Still, experts are alarmed enough to call for a pause in the rush to install the newer devices. In a joint statement, the heart association and the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute (one of the National Institutes of Health) say that before the old mercury devices are removed, the nation needs a system to be sure the new ones are accurate and reliable.
Yet while the prostate cancer death rate was reduced in the Swedish study, the overall death rate from all causes, including prostate cancer, was not. Fifty-three men who had surgery died, as against 62 men in the watchful-waiting group, a statistically insignificance difference. The study's principle investigator, Dr. Lars Holmberg of University Hospital in Uppsala, said he was not surprised because there were so many other possible causes of death in men in that age group. While prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in this country, it is but one of many reasons men of that age might die. To make an impact on the overall death rate, there would have to be a much greater decline in the prostate cancer death rate than occurred in this study. ''In this age group, the competing risks for death are so large that deaths from prostate cancer would vanish in the noise,'' Dr. Holmberg said in a telephone interview.
Dr. John E. Moulder, a professor of radiation oncology at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, noted that two previous, but less powerful, studies also failed to find a link between cell phones and brain cancer. Dr. Moulder has consulted for cell-phone service providers in Australia, Bermuda and Britain. Dr. Michael Thun, who heads epidemiological research for the American Cancer Society, said there was no increase in brain cancer incidence or mortality in the past decade, when the use of cell phones mushroomed. ''The evidence so far is reassuring,'' Dr. Thun said, ''but cell phones are a recent phenomenon and it is extremely difficult to prove that a new technology is absolutely safe.'' But Dr. George L. Carlo, who once headed an industry group, Wireless Technology Research, that supported the smaller study of brain cancer and cell-phone use, said the two studies were inadequate to assess the risks. Most patients they enrolled, Dr. Carlo said, had brain tumors that were too far from where the patients  held their cell phones to have been caused by the phones.
Significant numbers of older men whose results on a popular screening test for prostate cancer are normal may nonetheless have cancer, a new study has found. The result, medical experts say, raises questions about what a normal test score should be and whether these men are better off let alone or treated when, through biopsies, cancer cells are discovered. It also amplifies a controversy over the test, known as the P.S.A., and whether finding prostate cancer early and treating it by removing or destroying the prostate is, on balance, helping or harming men. The P.S.A. test is a blood test that looks for prostate specific antigen, a protein released by prostate cells. When the prostate gland enlarges, whether because of cancer or benign conditions, P.S.A. levels in the blood tend to rise. The test was initially used to look for recurrences of cancer after men had been treated. But in the 1990's it came into widespread use as a screening test to find new cancers.
Dr. Kathy Hudson, assistant director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, said that the group was submitting its paper on the findings of publicly financed genome project on Thursday, but that it would not say where. In the end, the compromise solution was for Celera to agree to allow scientists to use the data and to download parts of them with no restrictions. If researchers make a commercially important discovery using the Celera data, they do not have to give Celera any rights to their inventions. Companies that want to use the data for research purposes may do so, but they must agree not to redistribute them or to transfer them. In addition, Science stated in a news release that it would hold a copy of the data in escrow to make sure they would remain publicly available. Not everyone is satisfied. Dr. Eric Lander, a molecular biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who was one of the leaders in the Human Genome Project, said, ''Science magazine seems confused about the purpose of scientific publication.''
Many, like Dr. Lipsitz and Dr. Roubenoff, hold out high hopes for exercise. Dr. Roubenoff points to the problem of muscle loss, for example. ''Muscle loss happens to everyone,'' he said. But, he added, if people exercise regularly, they can go into old age with a reservoir of muscle that may protect them from slipping over the edge into frailty. They note that even when frailty has already developed, or is well on the way, it may be possible to reverse it. Numerous studies have shown that even very old, very weak people can gain strength and mobility through modest strength training. The question, however, is whether such programs will work for everyone or whether there are people who, for genetic reasons, simply do not respond, growing frail despite attempting to exercise. ''There certainly is a variability in response to exercise,'' Dr. Roubenoff said. ''How much of that is motivation and how much is biology we don't know.''
Dr. Clarence E. Grim, a blood pressure expert at the Medical College of Wisconsin, said doctors at an obstetrician's office near his hospital used were using an aneroid device that was consistently giving gave readings 30 points too low. At Hartford Hospital in Connecticut, where the mercury sphygmomanometers have been replaced with aneroid devices, one cardiologist, Dr. Paul Thompson, got permission to buy and keep three mercury devices for himself. Eric Rosow, director of biomedical engineering at Hartford Hospital, said his group bought the devices from a reliable company. The hospital then checked them against mercury sphygmomanometers. Now, he said, the group examines them quarterly to be sure that the dials read zero when they are not in use. Dr. Thompson is not assuaged. Recently, he said, he referred a patient for a test of her arteries that required taking nitroglycerin. The testing laboratory said ''they couldn't do it because her blood pressure was 90,'' he recalled. ''I said, 'Her blood pressure was never that low.' ''
Activity and Weight Dr. Richard S. Strauss says the reason for the obesity epidemic among children is obvious: children are so inactive as to defy belief. ''It's pretty clear what's going on,'' said Dr. Strauss, who directs the childhood weight-control program at the Robert Wood Johnson School of Medicine in New Brunswick, N.J. Children used to play outside. Now they just sit in front of a television set or a computer screen. ''Being inside used to be boring,'' Dr. Strauss said. ''Now it's exciting.'' He and his colleagues recently completed a study of children ages 10 to 16, giving them monitors to measure how active they were. ''We found that for about 10 hours of the day they're basically doing nothing,'' Dr. Strauss said. ''And what we call vigorous activity -- moving faster than three and a half miles an hour -- that was on average 12 minutes a day.''
''The only way to keep from gaining weight is to make gaining weight a conscious activity rather than an unconscious activity,'' Dr. Hill said. ''If you leave it to your physiology, you're going to gain weight. You have to plan.'' Dr. Madelyn H. Fernstrom, director of the weight management center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Health System, put it bluntly: ''The term 'chronic dieter' is not a negative one.'' And, Dr. Hill added, it is the responsibility of obesity researchers to tell the public that they really do have to think about food and exercise all the time. Ever Vigilant on Regimens For years, the great hope and promise of diet programs had been to get people's weight down and then allow them to, in essence, forget about food, living the rest of their lives like someone who was naturally thin. ''That was the meta-message. You go on a diet for short period of time and then the diet's over,'' said Dr. Gary D. Foster, who is the clinical director of the Weight and Eating Disorders Program at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.
''For many years many investigators have labored very intensively to get those cells to jump through the appropriate genetic hoops to form a tumor,'' Dr. DePinho said. ''They've thrown the book at these cells and have been horribly unsuccessful.'' Scientists were troubled. They use rodents routinely to study cancer. They test hypotheses and treatments in rodents and apply them to human cancer. Why, then, were they able to make normal rodent cells into cancer cells but unable to do the same with human cells? The next advance came from the discovery of a gene for an enzyme, telomerase, that cells use to put caps on the ends of chromosomes. ''They are like the caps on the end of shoelaces,'' Dr. Hahn explained. ''They protect the ends of the chromosomes from damage.'' In humans, telomerase is abundant during embryo and fetal life, but there is significantly less of the enzyme when cells mature -- except in most human cancer cells, where it once again is plentiful.
New research and studies that are under way are leading many heart disease experts to say they expect that the current guidelines for lowering cholesterol may not be stringent enough. Lower may be better, perhaps even stopping heart disease in its tracks, they say. A new study looking at the growth of plaque in arteries of heart disease patients came to that conclusion. And while medical experts are awaiting the results of studies asking if lower levels also lead to fewer heart attacks and deaths, many say they are betting that the answer will be yes. But there is just one problem. While it has become increasingly easier and more feasible to lower cholesterol levels, most people whose levels are dangerously high either do not know it or are not doing much about it. Recent national data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention illustrate the problem. Sixty percent of people with high cholesterol levels did not know that they were high. Of those who knew, only 14 percent were taking a cholesterol-lowering drug and only 7 percent were getting their cholesterol within the recommended limits.
Life expectancy is no greater in regions that have more intensive medical care, the researchers find, and Medicare surveys find that their quality of care is no better. ''What increased spending buys you is generally unpleasant interventions like intensive care units and feeding tubes,'' Dr. Wennberg said. Another recent study, on the distribution of newborn intensive-care specialists and the death rate among infants, reached a similar conclusion. A tripling of the numbers of these specialists did not result in any improvement in infant mortality. The Dartmouth findings are controversial, coming when much of the national conversation is about Americans who are receiving too little care -- not too much -- either because they lack insurance or because they cannot afford prescription drugs. Still, the research is attracting attention from mainstream medical groups, even those who say it is too preliminary to draw any firm conclusions. ''They are excellent scientists,'' said Dr. Yank D. Coble, president of the American Medical Association. But he added that many factors other than supply might be driving demand for medical services, including the cultural preferences in an area and the underlying health of its population.
But the lesson for Americans is clear. These days, and especially in the United States, with its screening and testing, ''we are labeled,'' said Dr. Hadler of North Carolina. ''I call that medicalized,'' he added. ''And one of my creeds is that you don't medicalize people unless it is to their advantage. When you medicalize people, they think they're sick, and in our culture it's, 'Do something, Doc. Don't just stand there.' '' Dr. Hadler has written a book about the problems of medicalization, calling it ''The Last Well Person: How to Stay Well Despite the Health Care System'' (McGill-Queen's University Press, 2004). The title refers to a story told by Dr. Clifton K. Meador, director of the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance, a cooperative program between the medical schools in Nashville. One day, as Dr. Meador tells it, a doctor-in-training was asked by his professor to define a well person. The resident thought for a moment. A well person, he said, is ''someone who has not been completely worked up.''
She is not surprised, though, by the increased public wariness. ''I really think food safety has become a much more high profile issue,'' Dr. Whelan said. ''Food is an intensely emotional topic. People who are otherwise rational become irrational about food safety. Most Americans hear 'cloning' and they hear 'genetic engineering' and it's all the same thing.'' Dr. Linda Tollefson, who is deputy director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Veterinary Medicine, said times had really changed since the late 1980's. ''Consumers in general are much more aware of what's in food.'' And companies, worried about a consumer backlash, are seeking the F.D.A.'s assurances that food is safe. ''The companies did come to us,'' Dr. Tollefson said. ''They said that they would like the concurrence of the F.D.A. before they start putting cloned animals in the food supply.''
''We had four chimp viruses, three that were closely related to each other and to the human strains,'' Dr. Hahn said. ''And they were different from a fourth strain. So we said, obviously, the west-central African chimps were the likely source'' of the human AIDS virus. But, she added, some scientists looked askance. ''Some said: Four chimps are not a lot. You don't know what happens in the wild,'' Dr. Hahn recalled. And so, she said, she and her colleagues set out to find a way to detect AIDS-like viruses in wild chimpanzees. Dr. Hahn and Dr. Shaw were pretty certain what they would find -- widespread infection with a virus that resembles the AIDS virus but does not make chimpanzees ill. After all, they reasoned, there must be a reservoir of infected chimpanzees if the virus had passed to people. The captive chimpanzees that were infected had not become ill. And researchers have found that other animals have their own AIDS-like viruses and are widely infected with them but do not become ill.
''The Tay-Sachs and thalassemia carrier screening programs over their 30-year existence in Montreal have resulted in an almost complete absence of new cases of these two diseases,'' Dr. Scriver said. Some critics ask about ensuring that people understand more complicated Jewish diseases, which may be more typical of genetic diseases in general. In Gaucher's disease, people can have a serious illness starting in infancy with anemia, bone pain and enlarged livers and spleens. While there is an effective treatment, it has cost as much as $150,000 a year. Half the people who inherit two copies of the mutated gene have no symptoms at all until their mid-40's, and some may never develop symptoms at all. ''You cannot predict who will have the severe disease,'' said Dr. Arno G. Motulsky, a geneticist at the University of Washington and a member of the advisory board to the group that wants to screen for the 10 disease genes. ''This becomes a very tricky issue. How should you counsel?''
A diffusion M.R.I. ''answers the question 95 percent of the time," Dr. Sorensen said. It seemed the perfect solution, but it was not. Most hospitals say they cannot provide such scans to stroke patients. They would need both an M.R.I. technician and an expert to interpret the scans around the clock. They would need an M.R.I. machine near the emergency room. Most hospitals have the huge machines elsewhere, steadily booked far in advance for other patients. It is simply not practical to demand the scans at every hospital or even every stroke center, said Dr. Edward C. Jauch, an emergency medicine doctor at the University of Cincinnati and a member of the Greater Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky Stroke Team. ''If you made M.R.I. the standard of care before giving tPA, most centers would not be able to comply,'' Dr. Jauch said. And if it takes more time to get a scan -- as it often does -- it might be better to forgo it and give tPA immediately if the patient's symptoms seem unambiguous.
But a high price tag is no excuse for Medicare to refuse to pay, said Dr. Joel Cooper, a lung surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis who introduced the operation about a decade ago. He said he was not participating in the study because he knows the operation helps patients, and so it would be unethical to randomly assign some to forgo it. Other surgeons agree, he said, adding that most of the 17 medical centers in the study are continuing to offer the operation anyway to paying patients. ''The centers keep two sets of books,'' Dr. Cooper said. ''They have two sets of surgeons.'' One is the official Medicare surgeon and one is the partner who operates on everyone else. Dr. Cooper said: ''If you say, 'I'm not a Medicare patient,' or if you say, 'I'll pay for it myself,' they say, 'You want to go next door. My partner will explain that of course we know this operation works.' ''
''I wanted to take the reader there, to give the reader that concrete sense of process, people working,'' Ms. Goodman said. Once, she saw a sign that had been posted by a postdoctoral student: ''DO NOT use my NaOH!! STOP!!!!'' ''I copied that. It was just too good,'' she said. The sign shows up in her book. She also noticed the routine, casual ways that the scientists would deviate from their protocols. There was a laminar flow hoodin the lab to allow researchers to work with the mice and not spread any viruses from the mice into the room, possibly infecting other animals. The researchers often ignored that hood. ''There is the theory and then there is the practice,'' Ms. Goodman says. ''All that was very, very interesting to me.'' When it came to writing the novel, Ms. Goodman mapped out each chapter with detailed outlines in notes that looked much like a script for a play. She diagrammed scenes; a few pages away from a drawing of a mouse cage in one of her notebooks is a sketch of the annual picnic that the laboratory held on the grounds at Walden Pond.(She also clocked her husband swimming back and forth across the pond so that when her characters did the same thing, she could get the timing right.)
Was it the drugs or the power of suggestion, the diet and exercise or the growth hormone that made the difference? Will she develop a serious disease as a result of taking the drugs or will she enter old age healthy and vigorous, younger than her years? It is impossible to know, researchers said, and that is why good studies are needed. ''Our concern is that the evidence is mostly based on personal testimonials rather than good data,'' Dr. Warner said. ''It's not hard to get people to believe something works, particularly if they are paying a lot of money for it.'' Dr. Alvin Matsumoto, a geriatrician at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, sounded a similar note of caution. ''For any particular patient, the trick is to determine who is the practitioner who has your best interests at heart. It is hard to distinguish that sometimes.''
Dr. Michael Berry, a professor of health and exercise science at Wake Forest University, explained the difference between casual and serious bicycling as ''the difference between the person who goes home and says, 'O.K., we've got a few minutes before the sun goes down,' and goes out and walks around the block, and the person who goes home and puts on running shorts and running shoes and goes out for a run, goes out specifically to exercise.'' A person whose time is limited and who wants to burn the most calories should stick to running, said Dr. Berry, who was a competitive runner before taking up cycling. But cycling calories can also add up. How many depends on wind speed and direction, the amount of uphill climbing, and riding on the tail of another rider, which can reduce energy expenditure by 30 percent. One of the few rigorous studies of caloric output during cycling was conducted by Dr. James Hagberg, a passionate cyclist and exercise physiologist at the University of Maryland. He monitored competitive cyclists, riding on a flat road at 15 to 24 miles per hour, and used the data to establish formulas for the number of calories burned depending on speed and body weight.
Reaction among those who may end up paying for new research has been mixed. Some are going along; others are arguing why them? But Medicare holds a powerful hand -- its beneficiaries are the biggest users of drugs and medical devices, and private insurance companies often follow Medicare's lead on coverage decisions. The problem arises because while drugs and devices are tested and evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration before they come on the market, those tests often leave huge gaps in doctors' knowledge of how well they work, and for whom. The tests to gain F.D.A. approval ''leave an awful lot of ground uncovered,'' said Dr. Richard Platt, professor and chairman of the department of ambulatory care and prevention at Harvard Medical School. They do not tell doctors or patients whether an older and cheaper drug is as good as or better than a newer one, for example. And they do not reveal whether older people, with many medical conditions, will fare as well as the generally younger and healthier people on whom the drugs or devices were tested.
Warren Wegele is on the front line of a medical revolution. After doing a simple blood test recently, doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center told Mr. Wegele, a 65-year-old former salesman for air compressor companies, that he had inherited a tiny alteration in one of his genes. A certain chemical unit out of the string of three billion that make up the mass of DNA in his cells is different from the norm. The alteration -- found in 5 percent of the population -- would normally be of no more medical significance to Mr. Wegele (pronounced WEG-lee) than his black hair or burly physique. But it translated into a potential medical catastrophe for Mr. Wegele when he became ill with congestive heart failure, a disease in which the heart muscle no longer contracts vigorously. On average, patients with the condition live 5  years after they become ill; some live 10 years or more.
Dr. Taubenberger and his colleagues spent nearly a decade carefully extracting and piecing together the viral genes, like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. Along the way, they published findings that they and others used to try to understand the 1918 flu, but until now they had published only the sequences of five of the eight genes that make up the virus. The last three, which make up half of the virus's length, are published today in their paper in Nature. In August, Terrence M. Tumpey of the Centers for Disease Control and his colleagues used the viral genome to reconstruct the 1918 virus, and they wondered what would happen if they infected mice and if they infected tissue from human lungs. And, they asked, would the virus remain as lethal if they switched some of its genes with genes from today's influenza viruses? The scientists took great precautions, Dr. Gerberding said, using special labs that were designed to protect the researchers and prevent the spread of the viruses. ''We have erred on the side of caution at every step of the process,'' she added.
The F.D.A. used to exempt most academic research from this process, said William Vodra, a former F.D.A. lawyer who now works for the law firm Arnold &amp; Porter in Washington. But, he said, with recent problems, including the death of a subject in a gene therapy study at the University of Pennsylvania, that policy ''was shaken to the core.'' But if the F.D.A. did require universities to adhere to the same standards for research studies as industry, it was not clear where the money would come from, he said. ''I don't think society will be comfortable with industry picking up the tab,'' Mr. Vodra said. ''And I don't think George Bush wants to repeal his tax cut to pay for this.''
Dr. John Gearhart, a stem cell researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said the new paper would provide an impetus. ''I think you will see more people in the game,'' he said. Not everyone is excited. Dr. Leon Kass, chairman of the President's Council on Bioethics, commented in an e-mail message that ''whatever its technical merit, this research is morally troubling: it creates human embryos solely for research, makes it much easier to produce cloned babies, and exploits women as egg donors not for their benefit.'' The South Korean government, which paid for the new study, has made it a crime to implant a cloned embryo into a woman's uterus, Dr. Hwang said. ''It should be banned throughout the world,'' he added. The study included 18 women who provided eggs. The South Korean scientists worked hard, said Dr. Gerald Schatten of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who visited their laboratory and helped the scientists, whose English is limited, write their paper.
''Many companies see this as the way of the future.'' Dr. Sigal said. The Ethics  Discriminatory Risks In Genetic Testing Mention genes and diseases to many ethicists and they will see a dark side to a bright future. Will people be getting information about their medical conditions that they would rather not know? Can their privacy be protected? Few are more acutely aware of these problems than Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, the federal effort to map the human genes. From its inception, the genome project has had ethicists as consultants, and it has had to answer piercing questions about the consequences of unveiling what could be intimate genetic information. While Dr. Collins is excited by the prospect of pharmacogenetics, he sees situations in which it could raise privacy problems. Knowing if someone will respond to a drug, or have a side effect, can tell something about that person's susceptibility to disease.
''My experience was plain and simple,'' said Alice Wolfson, a 55-year-old lawyer in San Francisco. Although she has no risk factors for heart disease, she said, her doctor urged her to take the therapy to protect her heart. ''My doctor said, 'You should be taking hormone replacement therapy,' '' she recalled. Sarah Grindel, 59, who runs a quilting business with her daughter in Rockport, Mass., saw three doctors, all of whom insisted that she should take estrogen to protect against heart disease, even though her blood pressure is low, her cholesterol level is fine and she has no family history of heart disease. ''Every doctor was saying just do it, do it,'' she said. Dr. Wenger, a principal investigator in the Women's Health Initiative Study, said yesterday that her office had been inundated with calls from other doctors. ''My phone has been ringing off the hook from my colleagues,'' she said. ''Should I let my wife take estrogen? Should my wife continue with estrogen?''
Dr. Hillis said he tried to explain the evidence to patients, to little avail. ''You end up reaching a level of frustration,'' he said. ''I think they have talked to someone along the line who convinced them that this procedure will save their life. They are told if you don't have it done you are, quote, a walking time bomb.'' Researchers are also finding that plaque, and heart attack risk, can change very quickly -- within a month, according to a recent study -- by something as simple as intense cholesterol lowering. ''The results are now snowballing,'' said Dr. Peter Libby of Harvard Medical School. ''The disease is more mutable than we had thought.'' The changing picture of what works to prevent heart attacks, and why, emerged only after years of research that was initially met with disbelief. Early attempts to show that opening a narrowed artery saves lives or prevents heart attacks were unsuccessful. The only exception was bypass surgery, which was found to extend the lives of some patients with severe illness but not to prevent heart attacks. It is unclear why those patients lived longer; some think the treatment prevented their heart rhythms from going awry, while others say that the detour created by a bypass might be giving blood an alternate route when a clot formed somewhere else in the artery.
Obesity experts say that many fat people will have to lower their expectations and realize that they can look and feel better even though they will not be thin. ''Most of us have a little bit of an unrealistic idea of what we should look like,'' said Cathy Monas, the director of the weight management and nutrition center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York. Ms. Monas reminds patients of how much better their lives are with even a small but sustainable weight loss. ''We say, 'Look, you're maintaining your weight. Your blood pressure has gone down, your cholesterol has gone down, you're playing tennis again. This is terrific.' '' That, of course, is not the message that many fat people want to hear. Dr. Foster says he tries to explain to patients that they must be realistic. But, he said, ''when you tell a woman who weighs 220 pounds that she has to lose 22 pounds, she looks at you like you've got three heads.''
We say, well, we want doctors to provide hope. And again and again, doctors told me about their struggle with this. They would say things like: ''Patients will not improve if all hope is denied. Yet it is important to be realistic.'' Another doctor says, ''Under bad circumstances, physicians should be as encouraging and optimistic as possible, and should also be honest with the patient and family.'' Another physician said, ''I try to be hopeful and realistic.'' And here's my favorite quote. One doctor said to me: ''Always exude optimism tempered with reality. And be humble at the same time.'' This speaks to the impossibility of the task that physicians face.  Q. There is the idea that patients need hope and that the doctor can destroy a patient by taking away hope. Is that true?  A. The way out of that conundrum is to recast our vision of hope. We need to have hope and optimism not about the cure of the disease but about a variety of other objects so that the object of our hope shifts at the end of life.
'''What's this I hear?' I exclaim, putting on my severest face, which I do perhaps once a year. 'Very well then; eat! Get fat! Become ugly and thick, and asthmatic, finally die in your own melted grease. ''' In 1863, the low-carbohydrate diet returned after the publication of ''Letter on Corpulence'' by a London undertaker, William Banting. At 5 feet 5 and 202 pounds, he suffered, he said, ''sneers and remarks of the cruel and injudicious.'' But after a doctor told him to cut back on carbohydrates, he lost 50 pounds. ''I am most thankful to Almighty Providence for mercies received, and determined still to press the case into public notice as a token of gratitude,'' he wrote. So many were converted that for decades in the United States, the word for dieting was ''banting.'' The term is still used in Britain, says Dr. Hillel Schwartz, a cultural historian and visiting scholar at the University of California at San Diego.
In 1983, the morning sickness drug Bendectin was removed from the market amid a barrage of lawsuits claiming that it caused birth defects. Now, in what medical and legal experts say is a highly unusual reversal of fortune, it may well be brought back. A small privately held Canadian company, Duchesnay Inc., is working with the Food and Drug Administration to gain permission to market a generic version of Bendectin, which it calls Diclectin. Duchesnay is already selling the drug, its only product, in Canada, labeling and marketing it specifically for pregnant women. The company says -- and medical experts agree -- that dozens of studies, many prompted by the litigation, have failed to find that Bendectin poses any dangers to pregnant women or their fetuses. And the drug agency said that since Bendectin was withdrawn by its maker, independently of the agency, and was not withdrawn for reasons of safety or efficacy, it might not be difficult to bring it back.
''I have patients right now who are struggling with this,'' said Dr. Raymond DuBois, a colon cancer specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine who has been a consultant to Merck and Pharmacia, a previous maker of Celebrex. One family, Dr. DuBois said, learned just last week, when the Celebrex news broke, that their child was affected. Many scientists say that the decline and fall of the COX-2 inhibitors is particularly poignant since these were drugs that once seemed to be the perfect marriage of science and clinical medicine. They were designer drugs, deliberately created to have the pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin without its side effects of ulcers and bleeding. And laboratory research, animal studies and serendipitous observations of cancer patients made researchers hopeful that the COX-2 inhibitors would be the first safe and effective drugs that could actually prevent cancer. The story began in the 1980's, when scientists studying cancer discovered COX-2, which was activated when cells were inflamed or proliferating. It turned out that aspirin and related drugs blocked COX-2, but they also blocked a related enzyme, COX-1. And blocking COX-1 prevents platelets from clumping and so can cause bleeding and stomach ulcers.
But people with anomalies like Mr. Wegele's altered gene, doctors told him, usually live only one to two years. For these people, the drugs used to treat the disease may be of little help. ''I don't accept it,'' Mr. Wegele said of the bad news doctors gave him about his gene, which directs heart cells to make a crucial protein. After all, he argued, as he lay in his hospital bed, ''I've never really gotten ill, and I've always recovered from everything instantly.'' But Mr. Wegele's former vigor was beside the point. Clearly ill, he had spent weeks in the hospital, growing sicker by the day, waiting for a heart to become available for a transplant -- the only way, his doctors said, to save his life. The revolutionary new genetics that predicted Mr. Wegele's dire circumstances is not about genes that confer generally good health or health that is generally poor. Instead, it is about a collection of common single-molecule variations in genetic material that are normally no more important than having curly or straight hair or brown or blue eyes, but might be revealing when people become ill.
''This is really telling us about a system of natural immunity to viruses,'' said Dr. Joseph Sodroski, a professor of pathology at Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute who was the lead author of the study. He described the protective mechanism used by the cells as ''very specific, very potent and very targeted to particular viruses.'' Dr. Nathaniel R. Landau, an AIDS researcher at the Salk Institute in San Diego, called the study ''excellent,'' and predicted, ''I think it's going to open up a new avenue of research.'' Dr. Sodroski and other researchers said innate immunity might help explain why some people were more prone to getting H.I.V. or other viruses, or why the same types of infections were mild in some people and severe in others. The clue may lie in slight individual differences in cellular proteins conferring this immunity, they said. The finding will not immediately lead to new AIDS drugs, the scientists said, but they said that any time a new way of intervening in a virus's life cycle is discovered, it can generate ideas for antiviral therapies.
With another method, called RNA interference, investigators can turn off any gene and see what happens to a cell. And new methods of DNA sequencing make it feasible to start asking what changes have taken place in what gene. The National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute recently announced a three-year pilot project to map genetic aberrations in cancer cells. The project, Dr. Druker said, is ''the first step to identifying all the Achilles' heels in cancers.'' Solving the problem of cancer will not be trivial, Dr. Golub said. But, he added, ''For the first time, we have the tools needed to attack the problem, and if we as a research community come together to work out the genetic basis of cancer, I think it will forever change how we think about the disease.'' Already, the principles are in place, scientists say. What is left are the specifics: the gene alterations that could be targets for drugs.
''People can't be told they can either join the program or be in a control group. That's not what this treatment is about,'' he said. Dr. Stifler said his company had data showing that patients dropped large amounts of weight if they stuck with the diet. When the company assessed patients three years later, some had still kept the weight off. Much of that data has not been published, Dr. Stifler said, but it has been presented at professional meetings. Robert Hallock, vice president and general counsel for Medifast, also said his company had unpublished but promising data. The company keeps track of thousands of patients, he said, and ''everyone knows that very low-calorie diets and structured programs get huge amounts of weight loss.'' As for Internet-based weight loss programs, the only study Dr. Wadden and Dr. Tsai found was one that Dr. Wadden, Dr. Leslie Womble and their colleagues conducted, using eDiets, which provides clients with low-calorie recipes and foods. They randomly assigned participants to use eDiets or a standard behavioral weight-loss manual. They also provided counseling and weigh-ins to all the participants. After a year, the eDiet participants had lost 1.1 percent of their weight while those using the manual had lost 4 percent.
''I guess I sort of had the view that whether I considered this a problem has to do with the likelihood that it would persist over time if you did nothing,'' he said. Dr. Whitaker said he suspected that it was not just the child's weight that mattered but also the parents' weights and that the prognosis would be much grimmer if a fat child had fat parents. Dr. Whitaker said he thought that genetic controls that made people become fat and stay that way would more often occur in the children of fat parents, who presumably had the genes that kept them fat. But how much worse is it to be the fat child of fat parents? Dr. Whitaker looked for studies that would answer the question. He came up empty-handed. So Dr. Whitaker and his colleagues decided to get some answers. Using data from the Group Health Cooperative, a health maintenance organization in Puget Sound, Wash., they examined data from 854 people born from 1965 to 1971, following their heights and weights until 1994.
The finding was so serious that it could be comparable in its health effects to a vitamin deficiency, medical experts said. It was so shocking that U.S. News &amp; World Report published a special 11-page section warning the nation. ''There is deep concern in high places over the fitness of American youth,'' the magazine's report began. ''Parents are being warned that their children -- taken to school in buses, chauffeured to activities, freed from muscle-building chores and entertained in front of TV sets -- are getting soft and flabby.'' The date of that report was Aug. 2, 1957. Nearly 50 years later, the hand-wringing continues, but now it is compounded by concerns about an obesity epidemic. Public health experts say they do not know why their exercise exhortations have gone unheeded for so long, but they are gathering more evidence of the extent of Americans' inactivity and the health benefits that could accrue from even moderate exercise. The latest sallies appeared last week.
Mr. Woodland was outwardly calm. ''I've got to think about it,'' he said. ''If it's best for me to have treatment, I'll get treatment.'' He signed up to be a patient at the medical center and went home. Dr. Kaplan said some scientists had criticized the study because it found so few men with hepatitis C. ''Yes, it's a small number,'' Dr. Kaplan said. ''And yes, one could be critical of the small number. But it goes against a pervasive thought that the diagnosis of hepatitis C borders on a death warrant. If it does nothing more than to say to people that we should look at that assumption again, then it has served its purpose.''
Helping men with H.I.V. have children is one of the last taboos for specialists, who now routinely offer services to patients with advanced cancer, gay men who use surrogate mothers, single women who pick sperm donors from catalogs and women well past menopause. While no statistics indicate how many of the nation's nearly 400 fertility clinics offer services to men with H.I.V., interviews with doctors and couples seeking help suggest that the number is minuscule -- and that such clinics are hard to find, as they tend to shun publicity. Many fertility doctors say they are torn over treating infected men. They worry about medicine, ethics and their business. Whether to treat women or infected couples is even more controversial, because an infected woman is much more likely to pass on the virus to the baby. And while clinics say their methods can minimize the transmission risk from an infected man to an uninfected woman and from her to the baby, too few procedures have been done to ascertain the risk.
Ultraviolet light revealed faint traces of writing, but it included both the prayers and the mathematics. ''The major problem is the combination of the fact that many characters are hidden with the fact that many are so faint that they are invisible,'' Dr. Netz said. Then there are the gaps where the pages were ripped or eaten away by mold. Computer imaging helped. Dr. Roger Easton of the Rochester Institute of Technology, Dr. Keith Knox of the Boeing Corporation and Dr. William Christens-Barry of Johns Hopkins University managed to write programs to pick out writing from the ''noise'' around it, and in many places the Greek letters fairly pop off the computer screen. ''The product of the software is incredible,'' Dr. Netz said. But it too has limitations, especially near the tattered edges of the pages. To reconstruct the writings, Dr. Netz and Dr. Nigel Wilson, a classics professor at Oxford University, are using every tool available: ultraviolet light, the computer images, Mr. Heiberg's photographs and their own intimate knowledge of ancient Greek texts. Still, in some areas, ''the text is likely to remain a conjecture,'' Dr. Netz said.
New research has found that Alzheimer's patients at the end of their lives often receive everything that medicine has to offer. For example, a recent study of nursing home patients, by Dr. Susan Mitchell of Harvard and the Hebrew Rehabilitation Home for the Aged, found that those with end-stage Alzheimer's received more aggressive medical treatment -- including feeding tubes, intravenous fluids and antibiotics and hospitalizations -- than cancer patients at the end of their lives. But Alzheimer's patients rarely receive the palliative care intended to relieve suffering but not to prolong life that is normal in cancer cases; they make up only 7 percent of people who receive hospice care. The comparison with cancer patients is imperfect because cancer patients often die more quickly, and, unlike Alzheimer's patients, they can speak for themselves about their care. But some experts and family members argue that intensive treatment in cases of late-stage Alzheimer's patients is inappropriate, even cruel, and that its costs are excessively high.
Dr. Jeffrey Botkin, a professor of pediatrics and medical ethics at the University of Utah and chairman of the ethics committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics, asserted that only PKU and perhaps five other conditions among the 29 had treatments that were known to work. Tests he considers problematic include those that identify disorders like citrullinemia and arginosuccinic aciduria, which lead to an accumulation of ammonia and can result in coma and death; and tyrosinemia, caused by a missing enzyme, which can be lethal unless the child has a liver transplant. Each disorder affects fewer than 100 babies a year. ''The conditions are not well understood, the spectrum of the disease is not well understood, it is uncertain how efficacious the treatments are, and it is uncertain how well people can tolerate the treatments,'' Dr. Botkin said. When little is known about the effectiveness of screening and treatments, Dr. Botkin said, that raises concerns about babies who test positive but have a mild form of a disorder. He added that screening tests typically picked up substantial numbers of such babies.
When I got home, my son and I headed out for a quick ride. Before I had gone a quarter-mile, I knew what the man at the shop meant. The bicycle responded, it handled, it moved, it was like a living thing. I was flying. Now that was bicycling.
From redesigned first-aid kits to a radically new kind of surgery on the front lines, battlefield medicine has changed markedly and, as a result, doctors in the war in Iraq hope to significantly reduce the death rate from battlefield wounds -- a rate that has not budged for 150 years. Since the Civil War, experts in military medicine say, one of five wounded soldiers has died, half from profuse bleeding. Pentagon doctors hope to change that, and have mobilized an array of innovations. Some, like putting pressure bandages in first-aid kits, are drugstore cheap. Others, like a new anticlotting drug for internal bleeding, are high-tech expensive, about $7,000 per dose. And some, like sending radically redesigned surgical teams to operate at the front lines, involve tactics and equipment that simply were not available in the last gulf war. These special surgery units were tested in Afghanistan, where they reduced the died-of-wounds rate, the death rate for those who survived long enough for a surgeon to operate, to a fraction of a percent. For the past half-century, it has hovered around 2 percent.
As for now, Dr. Neill said, the flu season has not begun. ''If someone comes in, shaking badly, I'm not going to say, 'This is the flu,' '' she said, ''particularly if they were in a geographic area that has anthrax.'' A NATION CHALLENGED: THE RESPONSE  Correction:  November 1, 2001, Thursday  An article on Oct. 5 about a news briefing on the first of the series of  pulmonary anthrax cases quoted incompletely from two comments by Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services. Parts of the incomplete quotations were repeated in an article on Sunday about the nation's minimal experience with anthrax. According to a transcript from his office, Mr. Thompson said, ''Based on what we know at this point, it appears it is an isolated case,'' and later said, ''But I want to point out once again that this is an isolated case, and it's not contagious'' (not ''It is an isolated case, and it is not contagious''). Before being interrupted by a question, he also said, ''There's no evidence of terrorism -- at this ---- '' (not ''There is no terrorism'').
While cancer researchers recognize that not every cancer will grow and become deadly, they cannot predict which ones are dangerous and which are not, so they treat them all. ''Some women were getting mastectomies that they didn't need,'' Dr. Baines said, adding that the test did not help younger women. ''I think the message should be accepted by all rational people.'' In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Harold Sox, editor of The Annals, wrote that his interpretation of an analysis of several large randomized clinical trials in Sweden was that they also failed to find a benefit from mammography in women under 50. ''The big picture message is that the effect of screening in any age group is limited at best,'' Dr. Sox said in a telephone interview. He said there appeared to be a small benefit in women starting at 50, and so he agreed with the task force for that age group. But, he said, for women in their 40's, ''it is not clear that there is any benefit at all.'' With such questions, he added, ''I think we should be worried about harms.''
''We forget the dementia,'' Dr. Morrison said. ''What people see is a potentially curable illness.'' Burton Federman, 79, of Brockton, Mass., allows intravenous antibiotics for the infections of his wife, Diana, 76, but not a feeding tube. Twelve years after she entered a nursing home with Alzheimer's, she is still able to eat if someone spoon-feeds her. He and his two daughters visit her nearly every day. ''She sits in a chair,'' Mr. Federman said. ''She hasn't spoken for several years, and I can't say that when I or any of the family comes that there is any recognition. Occasionally, some sort of guttural sound will come out, but other than that, nothing.'' Reflecting on a common question, he said: ''People ask us: 'Why do you do this? She doesn't know you. She doesn't speak.' But we know ourselves. As long as there's any breath left, we're not writing it off.''
In December 1995, an international consortium of advocates for emergency contraception sought a company to make a pill specifically for emergency contraception that did not have the side effects of birth control pills. They found Gedeon Richter, a Hungarian firm, to make a pill consisting solely of a synthetic hormone, a progestin. Women would take one progestin pill immediately and a second one 12 hours later. The old birth control pill regimen provided women with a combination of estrogen and progestin. With the pill in production, the World Health Organization, a member of the consortium, then tested it, finding in an international study that it was just as effective as using birth control pills for emergency contraceptives. But with this pill, just 23 percent of women complained of nausea -- 50 percent fewer than with birth control pills -- and 5.6 percent vomited, 70 percent fewer compared with birth control pills.
Two important studies being published today challenge conventional thoughts about treating and avoiding breast cancer. One suggests that doctors may eventually be able to identify women who do not need chemotherapy. The others says that women who have had hysterectomies can take estrogen to relieve symptoms of menopause without increasing their risk of breast cancer. The first study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, indicates that many of the 70 percent of women whose cancers are fed by estrogen get so much benefit from estrogen-blocking hormonal therapy that chemotherapy adds little if anything. The caveat is that there is as yet no reliable way to identify the women who may not need chemotherapy. Currently, guidelines call for women to get chemotherapy if their tumors are of a certain size. Dr. Eric P. Winer, an author of the paper who is director of the Breast Oncology Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, explained the guidelines' message: ''Virtually every woman with a tumor larger than a centimeter should get chemotherapy. Period. End of story.''
''Is it worse than Alzheimer's?'' he asked. ''I don't think so. Is it worse than a debilitating stroke? I don't think so?'' The problem with demanding that treatments or screening tests reduce the total death rate, however, is that it is a high hurdle, sometimes an impossible one, researchers say. Statistics can be against you if a disease causes proportionately few deaths. Men in their 70's and 80's, for example, are at risk of dying of many diseases besides prostate cancer, and so even if prostate surgery saved a few lives, that effect could be lost because there are so many other deaths from other causes. It is easier to find effects on the death rate when all you look at is the deaths from the particular disease, but there are trade-offs. One problem, said Dr. Steven Goodman, a biostatistician at Johns Hopkins, is that you may be missing risks.
''There is a lot of controversy as to why,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone thinks it has to do with the skill of the surgeon doing the original operation.'' Instead, Dr. Birkmeyer explained, the key may be the tumor board, a group of medical specialists who review each patient's proposed treatment program. At medical centers that see large numbers of patients, the tumor boards, he said, ''may be better at matching patients with therapies.'' ''The totality of evidence leaves little doubt that for most serious cancers, you improve your outlook by going to an experienced center,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. Yet, Dr. Downey said, most of his patients do not ask about such things. ''And when they do, they're apologetic,'' he said. Instead, they tell him they went to Memorial Sloan-Kettering because a local doctor told them to, or because they know someone who was treated there and did well. The most common reason, though, is the hospital's famous name. ''As soon as they hear the word 'cancer,' they head for Memorial,'' Dr. Downey said.
Other researchers, like Dr. Ishwarlal Jialal of the University of California, Davis, have found evidence that CRP itself might cause heart disease. The protein, which is secreted in response to inflammation, is present in plaque, he said, and can create conditions for a heart attack. (Dr. Jialal is on advisory boards for Merck, which made Vioxx, and Pfizer, which makes Celebrex.) Scientists have learned that the standard advice for the public -- lose weight, stop smoking and get any diabetes under control -- can also result in lower CRP levels. But much remains uncertain. One study found that aspirin, an anti-inflammatory drug that can prevent heart attacks, lowered CRP levels in heart patients. Another found no such effect in healthy men. That second study also found strenuous exercise slightly increased CRP levels. Some researchers, like Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, lead author of the second article in The New England Journal, say that while more research is needed, he knows enough to make some clinical decisions for patients who are in danger of a heart attack now. High CRP levels are dangerous, Dr. Nissen said, and it is imperative for many patients to drive them down.
But Dr. John Hathcock, the vice president for scientific and nutritional affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition disagrees. He is not convinced by the new study's conclusion that high doses of vitamin E are risky, Dr. Hathcock says, and he believes there is at least presumptive evidence that it can help. For the past 15 years he has taken 400 international units of vitamin E a day, he says, and he does not intend to stop.
''Everyone is focusing on Cipro, and that is giving the false impression that it is the only drug that would work against anthrax,'' said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Fauci said Cipro, or ciprofloxacin, is one of a class of antibiotics known as fluoroquinolones. ''There are other fluoroquinolones, and if you look at their spectrum of activity against microbes, they are essentially identical,'' he said. ''There are at least four and maybe five fluoroquinolones, and although they are not explicitly recommended, in a pinch they certainly are drugs that one would be able to use.'' The Food and Drug Administration has also approved two other types of drugs against anthrax, tetracyclines, including doxycycline, and penicillins. Originally, they were meant to prevent and treat cutaneous anthrax. But both drugs are also generally expected to work against infections caused by anthrax spores.
Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said her organization's clinics had been deluged with calls. ''We're taking tens of thousands of calls here,'' she said. Doctors at abortion clinics also say they have been inundated with calls from women who are interested in mifepristone. But the problem, they say, is that most of these women are confused about what the drug does. ''They think that no matter how far along you are in a pregnancy, you just swallow a pill and that's it,'' said Dr. West, the operator of the Dallas abortion clinic. ''There's a very common misconception in the lay public, and even way too common among physicians, that this is a nice, easy way to get rid of a pregnancy,'' said Dr. William Ramos, who runs an abortion clinic in Las Vegas. Many abortion providers say they tell women that a pill-induced abortion is an option, but that surgery is faster and less painful and requires one visit to the clinic rather than three. ''We're telling them straight up front that if any of us needed an abortion, we'd go for the surgical procedure,'' Dr. Ramos said.
In a letter, also in the journal, doctors describe 14 runners in the 2003 London Marathon with hyponatremia who waited more than four hours on average before going to a hospital. Some were lucid after the race, but none remembered completing it. That sort of delay worries Dr. Siegel. ''The bottom line is, it's a very prevalent problem out there, and crossing the edge from being dazed and confused to having a seizure is very tricky and can happen very, very fast,'' he said. Boston Marathon directors want to educate runners not to drink so much, Dr. Siegel said. They also suggest that runners write their weights on their bibs at the start of the race. If they feel ill, they could be weighed again. Anyone who gains weight almost certainly has hyponatremia. ''Instead of waiting until they collapse and then testing their sodium, maybe we can nip it in the bud,'' Dr. Siegel said.
Patients can develop bumps on their skin, their skin can sag and wrinkle, blood vessels in their gastrointestinal tracts and those in the legs can be blocked, causing pain, and so can vessels in the heart, causing heart attacks. But the disease's most likely serious consequence is a calcification and cracking of the membrane behind the retina. Blood leaks into the eye, causing progressive and severe loss of vision, with many becoming nearly blind by the age of 40. But the 400 papers that the Terrys found on the disease were just case studies. ''We knew right away that we did not want to wait in the deli line for our number to be called and whine 'when will you do our disease?' '' Ms. Terry said. They wanted to make it irresistible for scientists to find the gene that causes it. In 1996, they set up a foundation, PXE International, found 2,000 patients, established a repository of patients' tissue, raised money and enlisted scientists. The foundation's efforts succeeded.
The Dartmouth whooping cough story shows what can ensue. To say the episode was disruptive was an understatement, said Dr. Elizabeth Talbot, deputy state epidemiologist for the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services. ''You cannot imagine,'' Dr. Talbot said. ''I had a feeling at the time that this gave us a shadow of a hint of what it might be like during a pandemic flu epidemic.'' Yet, epidemiologists say, one of the most troubling aspects of the pseudo-epidemic is that all the decisions seemed so sensible at the time. Dr. Katrina Kretsinger, a medical epidemiologist at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who worked on the case along with her colleague Dr. Manisha Patel, does not fault the Dartmouth doctors. ''The issue was not that they overreacted or did anything inappropriate at all,'' Dr. Kretsinger said. Instead, it is that there is often is no way to decide early on whether an epidemic is under way.
A product can be a drug if a company tests it for safety and efficacy, receives approval from the Food and Drug Administration and makes the product according to Federal standards. But under current rules, many of the same products can be sold as supplements if they do not make drug claims. ''The boundary between food and drugs is by no means clear and sharp,'' said Dr. John Hathcock, the director of nutritional and regulatory science for the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents the supplement industry. ''It is perfectly legal and, I believe, also legitimate for some products to be on the market both as supplements and drugs.'' Patients who need products to treat diseases can take the drugs if their doctors prescribe them, Dr. Hathcock said, while others can buy the supplements. But patients, their advocates and companies that try to sell drugs like zinc acetate say it is not that simple. Because a substance sold as a supplement is not regulated by the F.D.A., there is no guarantee that it will contain the product on its label or that the dosage stated on the label is accurate. Although only a few products are sold as both drugs and supplements, some are vital to patients, especially those with rare disorders who must take them regularly and in fixed amounts.
Glucosamine and chondroitin are also marketed for pets -- dogs and horses in particular -- and veterinarians routinely prescribe them for arthritic animals. Nancy MacLeod, 65, an administrative assistant who works in Manhattan, said that as far as she was concerned, the supplements worked. ''The difference is like walking on a spike and having padding in your knee,'' Ms. MacLeod said. ''The medical profession says that can't happen, but I'm not in pain and I take no other drugs.'' Despite the study's findings, she said, ''I'm going to continue doing it.'' The study found that in a subgroup, consisting of patients with moderate-to-severe knee pain, 79 percent of those who took the supplements together improved compared with 54 percent of those who took a placebo. Such findings are viewed by most researchers as fodder for further studies but not as rigorous evidence in themselves, because they can be caused by random fluctuations in data and tend not to be confirmed in subsequent studies.
But, researchers say, most heart attacks do not occur because an artery is narrowed by plaque. Instead, they say, heart attacks occur when an area of plaque bursts, a clot forms over the area and blood flow is abruptly blocked. In 75 to 80 percent of cases, the plaque that erupts was not obstructing an artery and would not be stented or bypassed. The dangerous plaque is soft and fragile, produces no symptoms and would not be seen as an obstruction to blood flow. That is why, heart experts say, so many heart attacks are unexpected -- a person will be out jogging one day, feeling fine, and struck with a heart attack the next. If a narrowed artery were the culprit, exercise would have caused severe chest pain. Heart patients may have hundreds of vulnerable plaques, so preventing heart attacks means going after all their arteries, not one narrowed section, by attacking the disease itself. That is what happens when patients take drugs to aggressively lower their cholesterol levels, to get their blood pressure under control and to prevent blood clots.
For the first time, scientists have shown in a rigorous study that surgery to remove a cancerous prostate gland can reduce the risk of death from the disease. About a third of the 189,000 American men who are newly diagnosed with prostate cancer each year choose to have their prostates removed, said Dr. Patrick Walsh, director of the Brady Urological Institute at Johns Hopkins Hospital. But until now, Dr. Walsh said, doctors could offer no proof that the operation affected the course of the cancer, because it can progress so quickly -- or slowly -- that surgery might be useless. ''There was all this, 'We don't know,' '' Dr. Walsh said. ''There was all this uncertainty. It was crazy for men.'' The new study changes all that, he added. Others agreed. ''It's going to be a landmark study,'' said Dr. Otis Brawley, the associate director for cancer control at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University. ''It's really the first that shows that radical prostatectomy does something positive.''
But what the findings of those studies mean remains uncertain. That CRP levels drop with exercise and weight loss, for example, has led some experts to argue that the protein is a marker of heart disease risk, not a cause, just as gray hair is a marker rather than a cause of aging. CRP is made in the liver and also in the walls of coronary arteries and possibly elsewhere in the body. Its levels, which can be measured with a simple blood test, often rise and remain high in patients who have chronic inflammation from conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, for example, or periodontal disease. Patients with chronic inflammation also have an increased risk of heart disease. Questions remain as to the protein's normal purpose in the body. CRP was discovered about 70 years ago by scientists who were trying to understand why some strep bacteria caused disease and others did not. It is so called because it was found in the third band, which the scientists called Band C, in a gel used to separate proteins.
But many people, including doctors, wonder if they should plan for medical emergencies or for a sudden diagnosis of a serious disease and, if so, how. That is what troubled Dr. Peter K. Lindenauer, an internist and medical researcher at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Mass., and Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. At parties and at family gatherings, he said, friends, relatives and acquaintances often sidled up to him and asked for advice about where to go for medical care. He would tell them that if they had something as common as pneumonia or needed surgery for something as mundane as a hernia, they probably would do at least as well at a small local hospital as they would at a major medical center. But, he said, ''those comments were based more on gut than on actual evidence.'' He decided to look for proof. Dr. Lindenauer and his colleagues began looking at national data on two common conditions: pneumonia, the fifth-leading cause of death in America, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema and is the fourth-leading cause of death. ''When we think about bread-and-butter medical problems, these are the classic ones,'' Dr. Lindenauer said.
Opinion polls have had varied results, often depending on the words that are used to describe the work. In a recent Gallup poll, just 38 percent of respondents approved of cloning embryos for research. Another poll, which used the term ''somatic cell nuclear transfer'' instead of ''cloning,'' found that 72 percent approved. Dr. Hwang's paper goes a step further, using ''S.C.N.T.'' instead of ''somatic cell nuclear transfer.'' Dr. Ruth Faden, the executive director of the bioethics center at Johns Hopkins, said the moral debate would change if the research led to new treatments with dramatic benefits for some patients. ''That could really shake it up,'' she said. But Dr. Richard Land, the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's ethics and religious liberty commission, said his group would not be assuaged. ''We believe a cloned embryo is a human being,'' Dr. Land said. ''We should not be the kind of society that kills our tiniest human beings in order to seek a treatment for older and bigger human beings.''
''It was really quite astonishing,'' Dr. Wilkinson said. The woman should have had a brain that was ''absolutely peppered with amyloid plaque,'' but instead, huge areas were devoid of plaque. ''It was one of those, 'We remember when we were all sitting around the microscope' days,'' he said. Dr. Wilkinson published his finding last year in the journal Nature. Now, he says, four other patients from the trial have died, and their brains have been examined. One was from Portugal and the rest from the United States. In every case, the plaque was mostly gone. In four of the five cases, the patients had had severe brain inflammations, raising the question of whether it was the immunization or the reaction to it that cleared the plaque. But the fifth patient, who did not develop inflammation, also had little plaque. ''This is the first concrete evidence of a disease-modifying strategy for Alzheimer's disease,'' Dr. Relkin said.
Mrs. Brandt, who is 63, says that after her initial diagnosis and a lumpectomy, she went to the University of Pennsylvania's hospital and she became a patient of Dr. John Glick. She had radiation treatments and chemotherapy at Penn and is now going through more chemotherapy there because her cancer has spread. ''I never considered going anywhere else,'' Mrs. Brandt said. ''Dr. Glick is at the top of his research game, and from the beginning he instilled great confidence in me and my family.'' Other patients, Dr. Glick said, are eager to return to their local doctors for chemotherapy and follow-up care, and he encourages it whenever he thinks it is appropriate. Penn has a network of community physicians, and other academic hospitals, like Memorial Sloan-Kettering, have suburban satellite centers. ''We try to get patients back into our network of community physicians if we think the same care can be given,'' Dr. Glick said. If there is a specialized surgical technique or treatment that is available only at Penn, though, he encourages patients to stay at Penn for that treatment.
''I think that women don't know enough about it yet,'' Dr. Prine said. ''They don't know to ask for it.'' Correction:  September 26, 2002, Thursday  A front-page article yesterday about the slow sales of the abortion pill misstated the source of patients of Dr. Linda Prine, a family practice physician in New York. She does not advertise but relies on referrals from other doctors and word of mouth.
In an article published in 1995 in Annals of Epidemiology, Dr. Omenn urged scientists to be more careful about the words they used. ''We should be fastidious in referring strictly to 'associations' when the studies have generated associations; we should reserve the terms 'effects,' 'reductions,' 'decreases' and 'protects' to studies that actually alter incidences of end points, preferably in randomized, double-masked designs,'' he wrote. ''That's exactly right,'' said Dr. Barnett Kramer, deputy director of the division of cancer prevention at the National Cancer Institute. As editor of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Kramer deals directly with authors whose words convey more certainty than their data. ''We often have to work with them to change the wording,'' Dr. Kramer said. The ambiguous language is understandable, Dr. Kramer added, because scientists studying preventive measures fervently want their findings to be meaningful. ''It's easy to look at your data and say, 'Gee, I believe it has strong implications for human health,' '' Dr. Kramer said. ''It takes a lot of discipline to slow down and say, 'There are a lot of steps between what I observed and what I hope is true.' ''
Dr. Christopher P. Cannon of Harvard Medical School, the study's lead author, said heart patients should leave the hospital with a high dose of a statin, something that rarely happens now. He added that the millions of Americans who have high L.D.L. levels but ignore them should do so no longer. ''Everyone needs to shift up one level in their intensity of cholesterol treatment,'' Dr. Cannon said. ''Currently people will try a diet and say, 'O.K., O.K., I've been cheating a little,' and their doctor will say, 'Come back in six months.' Hopefully this will be a wake-up call.'' Dr. Eugene Braunwald, chairman of the Harvard Medical School group that conducted the study, said people with L.D.L. levels over 100, whether or not they have symptoms of heart disease, were ''accidents waiting to happen'' and should get those levels down. Like others interviewed, he said the lower the better.
Realism About Treatments Meanwhile the national debate over the use of human embryonic stem cells goes on. While many Americans say in polls that they favor using these cells, many others have strong moral objections. Creating and destroying a human embryo to obtain stem cells, they say, is ethically unacceptable, and doing research on human embryonic stem cell lines that are already in existence does not right the wrong. It is ''a kind of after-the-fact cooperation with this destruction,'' said Richard Doerflinger, deputy director of pro-life activities for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. The challenge for scientists in the midst of a fierce political debate, many say, is to be realistic about how hard it is to develop treatments. Dr. Battey lists some of the challenges ahead: getting the cells to develop into exactly the adult cells that are needed, demonstrating that the adult cells can survive, preventing rejection and controlling cell growth.
Hyponatremia is entirely preventable, Dr. Adner and others said. During intense exercise the kidneys cannot excrete excess water. As people keep drinking, the extra water moves into their cells, including brain cells. The engorged brain cells, with no room to expand, press against the skull and can compress the brain stem, which controls vital functions like breathing. The result can be fatal. But the marathon runners were simply following what has long been the conventional advice given to athletes: Avoid dehydration at all costs. ''Drink ahead of your thirst,'' was the mantra. Doctors and sports drink companies ''made dehydration a medical illness that was to be feared,'' said Dr. Tim Noakes, a hyponatremia expert at the University of Cape Town. ''Everyone becomes dehydrated when they race,'' Dr. Noakes said. ''But I have not found one death in an athlete from dehydration in a competitive race in the whole history of running. Not one. Not even a case of illness.''
Dr. Rabin said that just because there are other weaknesses in communications systems, that did not mean that secure encryption was not important. It is as though medical researchers started arguing that there is no need to find a cure for AIDS, Dr. Rabin said. After all, many more people die of heart disease, and if you cure people of AIDS, heart disease can still strike them. ''This is not a reason not to work on H.I.V.,'' Dr. Rabin said. ''The problem of H.I.V. is still important.'' Dr. Morris said that even though the actual breaking of codes might not be necessary to read encrypted messages, Dr. Rabin's method could have an effect. ''In a sense, what it does is shift the emphasis from cryptanalysis to some other sort of attack,'' he said.
Since the viruses mutate at a roughly constant rate, the researchers could construct a path of how the virus had mutated and determine how long it would take to move from one virus to another one with the amount of genetic diversity found today. From those calculations, they found a date when the spark of the epidemic was lit: 1931, plus or minus 15 years. ''You might think, if the virus was present in 1930, how on earth did we not see it?'' Dr. Korber asked. ''But if it is only present in a few thousand individuals and it takes a decade to get sick, it could easily have been missed.'' Researchers say the virus almost certainly infected humans repeatedly as they killed and ate chimpanzees over the years, but that it is hard to start an AIDS epidemic. For it to develop, the virus must be prevented from dying with its victims and a steady chain of transmissions must occur.
After years of telling athletes to drink as much liquid as possible to avoid dehydration, some doctors are now saying that drinking too much during intense exercise poses a far greater health risk. An increasing number of athletes -- marathon runners, triathletes and even hikers in the Grand Canyon -- are severely diluting their blood by drinking too much water or too many sports drinks, with some falling gravely ill and even dying, the doctors say. New research on runners in the Boston Marathon, published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, confirms the problem and shows how serious it is. The research involved 488 runners in the 2002 marathon. The runners gave blood samples before and after the race. While most were fine, 13 percent of them -- or 62 -- drank so much that they had hyponatremia, or abnormally low blood sodium levels. Three had levels so low that they were in danger of dying.
Another Advanced Cell researcher, Dr. Teruhiko Wakayama, who had cloned mice at the University of Hawaii, tried thousands of times before it worked. Others were luckier -- or very skilled. Dr. Steen Willadsen, a cloning pioneer in Windermere, Fla., said he cloned the first sheep from an embryo cell in the 1980's. It worked the first time he tried it -- he got a healthy lamb. But one problem in the field, said Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi, a mouse cloning expert at the University of Hawaii, is that scientists talk only about their successes, not their many failures. ''The ones that survive are the exceptions, not the rule,'' Dr. Yanagimachi said. ''People do not report negative results.'' Maybe they should, Dr. Dominko said, especially if cloning is to be used to make commercial products, like stem cells. ''If you want to make it into something that will have commercial value, not only do you have to pull a volume of material out of it, but the process has to be repeatable,'' she said. ''Your success cannot be 1 or 2 percent. A 2 percent success rate is not a success, it's a biological accident. Where's the other 98 percent? Show me them.''
Now they are planning to adopt. Another St. Barnabas patient who tried to keep a level head soon ended up, despite herself, caught in the fertility treatment trap. She, too, steered clear of unconventional procedures, but even so, the time, costs and emotional travail mounted quickly, and soon she and her husband found themselves agonizing over how and where to draw a line. The woman, who insisted on anonymity because she has not told people exactly how she ended up with a baby, started trying in 1998, when she was 30. Learning her husband's sperm count was low, she went to the Diamond Institute for Infertility in Irvington, N.J. There, she and her husband were told that in vitro fertilization would give them ''just a little push to get up the hill,'' she said. She became pregnant with the second cycle of treatment but miscarried. After five cycles, the couple switched to St. Barnabas, a big financial challenge, since the center did not accept their health insurance.
To people who have struggled for a lifetime to lose weight, the new drug called rimonabant sounds like a dream come true. It will make a person uninterested in fattening foods, they have heard from news reports and word of mouth. Weight will just melt away, and fat accumulating around the waist and abdomen will be the first to go. And by the way, those who take it will end up with higher levels of H.D.L., the good cholesterol. If they smoke, they will find it easier to quit. If they are heavy drinkers, they will no longer crave alcohol. ''Holy cow, does it also grow hair?'' asked Dr. Catherine D. DeAngelis, editor of The Journal of the American Medical Association. At obesity treatment centers, nearly every patient asks for rimonabant -- or Acomplia, as it will be called if its maker, Sanofi-Aventis, gets approval to market it in the United States.
Doctors often have no idea that happens, said Dr. Bertha Safford, a family care physician in Ferndale, Wash., whose practice is part of a 41-doctor group. ''We recently had a meeting with clinical care specialists and patients,'' Dr. Safford said. ''I was just horrified to hear their tales, and I took it back to the doctors. I told them, 'We have a serious problem. Patients can't get through.' The doctors said, 'Not at my office.' Every single doctor said that.'' Dr. Safford was quick to sign on to the Whatcom County program. She said she knew what would help her patients with chronic diseases: she and her colleagues ought to keep in contact with patients, they ought to send reminder notices about checkups and return visits if test results indicate a problem. ''It takes a whole different mind-set that it is our responsibility to do callbacks and reminders and to organize their care,'' Dr. Safford said.
But nothing was done, Dr. Fost said, adding, ''This train had left the station, and no one wanted to say we had screwed up.'' Finally, by the 1970's, the problems were sorted out. Researchers learned to distinguish true PKU from the innocuous condition and how best to prevent the consequences of the disease with a diet. ''Now it is an exemplary program,'' Dr. Fost said of PKU screening. PKU was not the only screening test that ran into problems. It happened, for example, with a test for acidic blood in premature babies, whose immature lungs have difficulty excreting carbon dioxide. The gas combines with water in blood to form carbolic acid. Eventually blood can be acidic enough to be lethal. The treatment seemed obvious: neutralize the acid with intravenous bicarbonate of soda. So for more than a decade, from the 1960's until the mid-1970's, every hospital in the country routinely screened premature babies for acidic blood and treated them with bicarbonate of soda.
In discussing these data, Dr. Norton said he relied on analyses by Dr. Eric J. Feuer, a National Cancer Institute statistician, and others. Dr. Feuer said that a number of factors could complicate an analysis. Since the mid-1930's, the incidence of breast cancer has been rising by about 1 percent a year, for unknown reasons, but perhaps including factors like delayed childbearing, Dr. Feuer said. In addition, the way doctors examine women to see if their cancers have spread has improved. For example, the number of women with cancers that had spread to their lymph nodes fell in the late 1980's and early 1990's to 35.63 from 42.16 per 100,000 women, probably reflecting the effects of mammography, he said. Then the rate rose again to 38.24 per 100,000, probably reflecting better detection methods. ''We're trying as best we can to tease it apart,'' Dr. Feuer said. Dr. Norton stressed that early detection and better treatments went together. Screening, he said, is needed to find the cancers most likely to be aided by better treatments.
The review is not just an academic exercise, warns Dr. David A. Kessler, who was the agency's commissioner from 1990 to 1997. ''It represents a frontal attack on the fundamental responsibilities of the agency under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act,'' said Dr. Kessler, who is now the dean of Yale's School of Medicine. ''I have great concerns that this is simply an attempt to deregulate while doing it in the name of the First Amendment.'' Others say the review is long overdue. Jonathan Emord, a lawyer who sued the F.D.A. on behalf of the First Amendment rights of supplement manufacturers and won, says the the agency has long been treading on shaky legal ground. ''We are advocating that the F.D.A. undergo a change in regulatory mind-set, a First Amendment sensitivity training,'' Mr. Emord said. ''They take the position that science must be interpreted for the public and given to them piecemeal when the regulators decide it is proven. That role of being a gatekeeper is precisely what the First Amendment was designed to prevent.''
With tube feeding and medical treatment for each crisis, end-stage Alzheimer's patients can live on, sometimes for years. Many no longer recognize family members, speak only a word or two, cannot walk or eat, and are prone to pneumonia and repeated urinary tract infections. ''We have this sense that you can only be dying for a decent interval, a few months or so,'' said Dr. Joanne Lynn, director of the Washington Home Center for Palliative Care Studies. ''You can't be dying for years.'' But that is what many demented patients do, Dr. Lynn said, adding, ''They just sort of hang on for remarkable lengths of time.'' Family members and doctors must decide what steps to take. But many find themselves at a loss. ''People desperately need some guidance,'' Dr. DeKosky said. ''Everyone, including the docs, is saying: 'Tell us what's O.K. Tell us what's appropriate.' '' Often, doctors simply treat the medical conditions as they arise, putting off conversations about where, and whether, to draw a line.
Last month the government halted a major study of hormone replacement therapy in healthy women, saying the treatment under study seemed to do more harm than good. But while that action generated headlines and alarm, few people noticed just a few weeks earlier when the government decided not to go ahead with a different study of hormone replacement -- in older men. The hormone is testosterone, and its use is soaring. Doctors wrote 1.5 million prescriptions for testosterone and drugs like it in 2001, up from 806,000 in 1997. The hormone has been trumpeted as a possible antidote for aging and a way to get a lean and muscular body. But while the theory is that testosterone may help counter the effects of aging -- bone and muscle loss, diminished libido -- those effects have never been demonstrated in a large clinical trial. As a result, medical experts say, men taking the drug are participating in a vast, uncontrolled medical experiment.
Dr. Daniel Rader, a lipid expert at the University of Pennsylvania, also expressed surprise, saying: ''It is amazing. The biggest and by far the most surprising thing is that it can happen so quickly. A weekly infusion? It is surprising enough that it makes us all want to see it replicated in a larger study.'' Dr. Bryan Brewer, chief of the molecular disease branch at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said, ''No one has ever seen anything like this in this amount of time.'' ''Hardening of the arteries takes years and years to develop,'' Dr. Brewer said. ''It was thought that if we initiate therapy to decrease or prevent it, it would probably take years to have an effect. We thought H.D.L. therapy would work, but that it would work in six weeks was something no one anticipated.'' But all the investigators urged caution. This was a single small study that needs to be confirmed. And then there need to be large studies showing that the drug-induced reduction in plaque corresponds to a reduced risk of heart attacks.
''We have in our hands the power to reduce the risk of heart disease by a lot,'' said Dr. Waters, who had no role in the research. ''It's very exciting.'' National guidelines call for levels of L.D.L. cholesterol, the kind associated with heart disease, to be below 100 milligrams per deciliter in high-risk patients. But the two-year study, of 4,162 patients hospitalized for a sudden attack of chest pain from heart disease, asked whether reducing cholesterol levels far below 100 milligrams would be beneficial. It found that the answer was yes. The study, by researchers at Harvard Medical School, will be published in the April 8 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, which released the findings now because they were presented in New Orleans yesterday at meetings of the American College of Cardiology. Patients in the study were randomly assigned to take Lipitor at 80 milligrams a day, the maximum dose, or Pravachol at 40 milligrams, the highest dose when the study began. (Although Pravachol is now available in an 80-milligram dose, experts say doubling the dosage does not make much difference in its ability to reduce L.D.L. levels.)
Doctors say that even though some patients worry about cox-2 inhibitors, many people continue to ask for the drugs. And doctors tend to comply, even when they suspect that the patients would do just as well with a cheap, over-the-counter pain reliever. Dr. Lockshin, for example, said about half of his arthritis patients who took nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs took cox-2 inhibitors. ''That's as much due to public pressure as to my desires,'' he said. ''They come in all the time and ask for them,'' he said. Dr. Sergent has the same experience. ''We have a lot of people who don't have contraindications to the standard drugs and who get cox-2 inhibitors,'' he said. ''If someone comes in and says, 'My friend is on Vioxx and I took some of it and it made me feel great,' I may not go to the trouble of suggesting they take naproxen first,'' he said.
Finally, it was time to go into the wild, working with primatologists who study chimpanzees so closely that they know each animal in a colony. That allowed the researchers to trace every sample to a specific animal, to verify suspected infections by looking at more than one sample from an animal, and to observe whether infected animals were ill. The primatologists collected urine and feces from 58 chimpanzees from colonies in the Ta√Ø Forest, a national park in Ivory Coast, in Kibale National Park in Uganda, and in Gombe National Park in Tanzania, and shipped the material to Dr. Hahn and her colleagues in the United States. None of the chimpanzee communities where primatologists spent years observing the animals included the subspecies, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, but the researchers expected that most chimpanzees, no matter where they lived, would be infected with AIDS-like viruses -- a situation that would resemble that of the cats and other African primates.
''The heart fails in one of two ways,'' Dr. Moss said. ''There can be a disastrous electrical catastrophe, an arrhythmia leading to sudden death. Or it can dwindle away,'' with increasingly feeble blood-pumping efforts, causing a slow death from heart failure. ''Up until now, the only treatment was for the mechanical problem -- that's what beta blockers and ace inhibitors did,'' Dr. Moss said. Some cardiologists are asking if the price for defibrillators might fall with wider use. Dr. Zipes said that one way to lower the price might be  for manufacturers to make simpler devices, ''a Volkswagen rather than a Rolls-Royce,'' he said. But Dr. Garber said the devices were inherently costly. ''They represent extremely sophisticated technology that has to be completely reliable,'' he said. ''I think they will remain expensive.'' Dr. Faxon said it should be possible to identify heart attack patients who fit the study criteria but who are more likely than others to be helped by the devices. That might enable doctors to restrict defibrillators to a somewhat smaller group. But that requires more research and, for now, there is no way of choosing those who should -- and those who should not -- get defibrillators.
It all makes for an odd and not entirely satisfactory coda to the antismoking crusade. But on balance, Dr. Williamson points out, a nation with an expanding waistline is in far better shape than one with a cigarette in its mouth. Obesity may be bad, he said, but the health effects of smoking are far worse. ''I sure would like for people not to be obese,'' Dr. Williamson said. But, he added, if they got that way because they don't smoke, then ''maybe the sky isn't falling quite as much as we think it is.''
Dr. Schuelke said he and his colleagues would be following the boy for years to come and eagerly watching what happens.
But it does bother opponents, whose safety arguments are joined by moral concerns. Opponents fear that women and teenagers may end up repeatedly using the drugs without doctors' supervision and without being monitored for the known risks of birth control pills. Dr. Wendy Wright, policy director for Concerned Women for America, said a recent death of a California teenager who took RU-486 without telling her parents or without further medical supervision, showed that teenagers could take major risks when they feared pregnancy. The main moral concern, opponents said, is that they do not consider the drug simply as a contraceptive. It has several actions that prevent ovulation, fertilization and a fertilized egg's being implanted in a uterus. The opponents say that life begins when an egg is fertilized and that the pill can, in fact, abort a life. ''When it comes to contraception as a policy issue -- access, availability -- the Catholic bishops do not get involved in that debate,'' a spokeswoman for the bishops, Cathy Cleaver Ruse, said. ''But when it comes to abortion, that's a different matter. It's far greater than just a religious issue. It's a human rights issue.''
Medicare bases its payments on a system in which each kind of service is assigned a ''relative value,'' Mr. Scully said. To increase the payment for routine office visits and stay within its budget, Medicare would have to decrease the relative value of other services. A committee of doctors meets each year to suggest relative values, he said, but ''the most aggressive and active groups tend to be the specialists.'' ''Year after year,'' Mr. Scully went on, ''the specialists come in and make a very strong argument for higher reimbursements. There's eventually a squeeze on the basic office visit.'' In many areas of the country, private insurers pay more for office visits than Medicare does, so doctors can essentially subsidize their Medicare patients. ''If we just saw Medicare patients and didn't see anyone with regular insurance, we wouldn't be able to pay the bills,'' said Dr. James E. Kurtz, an internist at Chatham Crossing Medical Center in Pittsboro, N.C.
Dr. Marcie Richardson, a gynecologist who is Dr. Connelly's partner -- the two direct the Harvard Vanguard Menopause Consultation Service -- said that, in fact, there are few alternatives for patients like Ms. Danzig. Dr. Richardson and others have begun giving some women antidepressants like Effexor, of a class known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. She has also used the anti-epilepsy drug Neurontin to control hot flashes and night sweats. Both treatments ''work about 50 to 60 percent of the time,'' Dr. Richardson said. Asked if women will have to take those drugs for the rest of their lives to prevent menopausal symptoms, Dr. Richardson and others said no one knows because there is too little experience with them. Doug Petkus, a spokesman for Wyeth, which makes Effexor, said he knew of no studies on the uses of the drug to treat menopause symptoms. He added that although some doctors say it works, the drug was not approved for that use. The same is true for Neurontin, said Dr. Eric Grossman, senior medical director at Pfizer, the drug's maker. ''We would caution people not to use preparations that have not been adequately studied,'' Dr. Grossman said.
It reappeared in the 1970's, in the hands of a French family that had bought it in Istanbul in the early 20's and held it for five decades before trying to sell it. They had trouble finding a buyer, however, in part because there was some question of whether they legally owned it. But also, the manuscript looked terrible. It had been ravaged by mold in the years the family kept it, and it was ragged and ugly. In 1998, an anonymous billionaire bought it for $2 million and lent it to the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, where it still resides. ''I should emphasize how incredibly uncommon the situation is,'' Dr. Netz said. With the manuscript in hand, a small group of scholars set out to reconstruct the original Greek text. It was not easy. ''You look with the naked eye and you see nothing, absolutely nothing,'' Dr. Netz said.
Dr. Diana Fite, a 53-year-old emergency medicine specialist in Houston, knew her blood pressure readings had been dangerously high for five years. But she convinced herself that those measurements, about 200 over 120, did not reflect her actual blood pressure. Anyway, she was too young to take medication. She would worry about her blood pressure when she got older. Then, at 9:30 the morning of June 7, Dr. Fite was driving, steering with her right hand, holding her cellphone in her left, when, for a split second, the right side of her body felt weak. ''I said: 'This is silly, it's my imagination. I've been working too hard.' '' Suddenly, her car began to swerve. ''I realized I had no strength whatsoever in my right hand that was holding the wheel,'' Dr. Fite said. ''And my right foot was dead. I could not get it off the gas pedal.'' She dropped the cellphone, grabbed the steering wheel with her left hand, and steered the car into a parking lot. Then she used her left foot to pry her right foot off the accelerator. She pulled down the visor to look in the mirror. The right side of her face was paralyzed.
A new drug regimen can markedly reduce the chance that breast cancer will recur in postmenopausal women, a large international study has found. The results were so strongly, and surprisingly, positive that the investigators ended the study early and offered the drug to women taking a placebo. The study involved 5,187 women at hundreds of medical centers in the United States, Canada and Europe. It asked what to do after they finish the recommended five-year course of tamoxifen, the standard treatment to prevent breast cancer recurrences. Tamoxifen, which blocks the hormone estrogen, is remarkably effective in postmenopausal women whose cancers are fueled by the hormone, about 100,000 women each year. But women gain no additional benefits after they take tamoxifen for five years, and so doctors have told them to simply stop taking it then and hope for the best. They are better off for having taken it: the drug's effects last for years after it is stopped. But they are left vulnerable to a return of their cancer.
''This is a new discipline,'' said Dr. Michael Kalichman, who teaches a similar course at the University of California at San Diego. ''All of us are in many ways floundering. What should we be teaching about, and how should we teach it so it is effective?'' The scientists say that there is a reason why they, not professional ethicists, are doing the teaching. ''We may not know as much as we would like to about ethics, but by and large people who are ethicists are not going to know much about the practical issues of doing science,'' said Dr. Michael Zigmond, a neurology researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. ''They may end up providing advice that will not work, and they may have a hard time relating to our students. They are coming from a different place.'' He and other scientists said they were largely self-taught in scientific ethics, by necessity. ''The truth is that somebody like me, who runs a lab, we deal with ethical issues several times a day,'' Dr. Zigmond said. And they have watched graduate students falter. ''Usually, these kids are good at evaluating research questions,'' Dr. Zigmond said. ''But when they step outside their field into ethics, it's as though they think their capacity to logically analyze a situation is suspended.''
''I would say that by doing these small studies, they are taking a Mr. Micawber approach to science,'' Dr. McKinlay said of the committee's report. He explained that Mr. Micawber, a Dickens character, ''always said he hoped something good would turn up.'' ''Let's do a trial here, a trial there, and if something good turns up, we'll pursue it,'' Dr. McKinlay said. But Dr. Hodes said the studies would give investigators an opportunity to carry out definitive clinical research at a far earlier stage than happened with estrogen. There, the effective studies only began after prolonged widespread use. With testosterone, Dr. Hodes said, ''this cow is not far out of the barn.''
But he continued to give sulindac to patients with F.A.P., to gather data and to publish results, though they got little attention. ''Very few people believed it,'' said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer researcher at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. ''I was intrigued by it, but I asked my clinical colleagues and they said it was unlikely to be valid.'' But by 1989, Dr. Francis M. Giardiello, a colon cancer specialist at Johns Hopkins, had heard of the sulindac findings and decided to test them in 22 patients, 11 of whom took the drug and 11 a placebo. His results were not as striking as Dr. Waddell's: patients who took sulindac had 44 percent fewer polyps after a year and the diameters of their polyps had decreased by a third. No patients saw all their polyps disappear. Still, Dr. Giardiello considered the results ''astounding.'' His paper was published on May 6, 1993, in The New England Journal of Medicine; this time, the sulindac story got national attention.
In one scene in her book, Dr. Mendelssohn's husband considers the drama playing out: ''As far as Jacob was concerned, his wife's work was basic science. Cancer was her instrument, not her enemy. The disease was her reveal, framing and displaying the workings of the cell.'' Ms. Goodman says that ''''The starting point for me is always the character.'' The lab was her reveal.

When he tested his own muscles, Dr. Costill learned why he was not a champion distance runner. ''I'm built like a sprinter,'' he said. ''I only had 35 to 40 percent of the muscles in my legs that were slow twitch. If you train a fast twitch fiber to do a lot of endurance work, it will eventually get a lot better, but it will never be as good as a slow twitch fiber.'' And that, he said, was his problem. ''I was running the mileage and doing all the things right, but you can only adapt so far.'' But while most people are in the middle of a bell-shaped curve in ability, there are a few who could be great athletes but, without training, never know it, Dr. Costill said. ''We've seen some of these people,'' he added. In addition to the runners at Cortland, there was a bicyclist at Ball State.
Now, said Dr. Christie M. Ballantyne, a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, it looks as if the study's name -- Prove It, for Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy -- was entirely apt, if not in the way intended. ''They did prove it,'' he said. ''But I don't think they proved what they thought they would prove. It is remarkable.'' Even though the Pravachol patients would, until now, have been considered adequately treated, their rate of heart attack, bypass surgery, angioplasty, symptoms like chest pain and events like stroke and death was 26.3 percent compared with 22.4 percent with Lipitor -- about 16 percent lower. The death rate among Lipitor patients was 28 percent lower than among those taking Pravachol, and the death rate from cardiovascular disease 30 percent lower. Researchers said they were particularly surprised because the study was intended to show that Pravachol was just as effective as Lipitor. The Harvard researchers specified in their contract with Bristol-Myers Squibb, the sponsor, that the results would be published no matter how they came out.
''If we in fact can intervene at this earlier stage and alter the course of the disease, that would have a big impact on quality of life,'' said Dr. Ronald Petersen, who directs Alzheimer's research at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. The signs of mild cognitive impairment are an inability to form memories for events that just happened and a slight shrinking of the hippocampus, the area of the brain where these memories are laid down. On a memory test, a patient may be able to repeat a string of unrelated words -- red, Oldsmobile, cabbage -- but then fail to recall even one of them 10 minutes later. No one knows how many people have the condition. While an estimated four million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, studies to determine the incidence of this milder disease that precedes it are only starting. But doctors say the new diagnosis is changing the landscape of Alzheimer's, giving rise to a growing class of patients with what Dr. Steven DeKosky, director of the Alzheimer Disease Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh, calls a sword of Damocles over their heads.
JUST before the end of last year, a prominent orthopedic surgeon was stretching to lift a heavy box and twisted his back. The pain was agonizing. He could not sit, and when he lay down he could barely get up. So the surgeon, Dr. James Weinstein of Dartmouth College, decided to go out for a run. ''I took an anti-inflammatory, iced up, and off I went,'' Dr. Weinstein recalled. When he returned, he said, he felt ''pretty good.'' It sounds almost like heresy. The usual advice in treating injuries is to rest until the pain goes away. But Dr. Weinstein and a number of leading sports medicine specialists say that is outdated and counterproductive. In fact, Dr. Weinstein says, when active people consult him, he usually tells them to keep exercising. The idea, these orthopedists and exercise specialists say, is to use common sense. If you've got tendinitis or sprained a muscle or tendon by doing too much, don't go right back to exercising at the same level.
In the case of dietary supplements, Dr. McClellan's proposal last month to ban ephedra got most of the attention. But that, he said, ''was just the tip of the iceberg.'' He said he had also issued 75 warning letters to supplement makers -- a fivefold increase from 2002, before he took office -- and seized millions of dollars worth of supplements that made false health claims or that were unapproved drugs masquerading as supplements. At the same time, the agency's actions on contentious women's health issues have been watched closely from all sides. For example, Dr. McClellan insisted that all hormone pills to ease menopause symptoms include hard-to-miss warning labels about their risks for cancer and heart disease. He also has not bowed to pressure from groups that say that mifepristone, a drug once known as RU-486 and approved in 2002 to induce abortions early in pregnancy, is unsafe. But for all the examples of his attention to regulation, some consumer advocates say he should be doing more.
Dr. Levy explains: Suppose a 50-year-old man does not have diabetes and does not smoke and keeps his cholesterol and blood pressure in the range recommended by national guidelines. Over the next 45 years, his chance of ever having a heart attack or symptoms of heart disease, like chest pain, is just 5 percent. The same goes for a 50-year-old woman with those risk factors under control. Her chance of symptomatic heart disease is 8 percent, slightly higher than the man's because women live longer. But only 5 percent of 50-year-olds have those risk factors under control. And give that man just one major risk factor, for example a high cholesterol level, and his chance of having symptomatic heart disease rises to 50 percent. The woman's chance rises to 39 percent. Only a third of people with high blood pressure have it under control, Dr. Levy said, even though there are dozens of effective drugs.
The prescription pain relievers Vioxx and Celebrex surged onto the scene two years ago with an unprecedented marketing effort by their makers and an avalanche of sales. Patients demanded the drugs. And doctors took out their prescription pads, often not even trying to dissuade people who would have done just as well with a cheap alternative, like acetaminophen or aspirin. Tens of millions of prescriptions have been written, and the drugs remain wildly popular. But now there are troubling questions about whether Vioxx may have an unexpected side effect -- a very slight increase in the risk of heart attack. The risk is hypothesized, not proved; it was suggested in a single Vioxx study and not in studies of Celebrex. And even one of the researchers who is most worried, Dr. Eric Topol, a heart disease expert at the Cleveland Clinic, said, ''We are not talking about big risks here.'' He added that his analysis showed that both Vioxx and Celebrex might increase the risk of heart attacks by 0.3 percent to 0.5 percent a year. That number may seem small, but with millions of people taking the drugs, even a small increase means ''you've got a lot of heart attacks on your hands,'' he said.
The nurses' study began at Harvard in 1976 with 121,000 nurses ages 30 to 55. The women regularly describe their medications, diets, smoking histories, medical problems, exercise habits and general health. In 1989, the study's directors enrolled a second generation of 116,000 nurses, ages 25 to 42. Researchers said they could hardly imagine a better group to observe. The women's responses were exemplary in accuracy and completeness. But there remained the thorny problem of correcting for factors other than the hormone therapy that might account for the results. Dr. Rossouw explained some complications, saying: ''One-third of the women who start taking estrogen are no longer on it at the end of one year, and half are no longer on it by the end of two years. The small group that takes it for many years is very unusual. They are very conscious of their health and of doing things to promote their health.
''It's a whole new role for Medicare,'' said Dr. Sean Tunis, Medicare's chief medical officer. In many ways, Medicare officials say, they are forced to take the lead because their beneficiaries are the biggest users of the new drugs and medical devices and no one else is getting the information that patients and doctors need to decide on treatments. Medicare itself has no research budget, the National Institutes of Health can only do so much with its budget and private companies often have a narrow focus in studies they pay for. Now, with medical costs soaring, with Medicare's budget at $320 billion and with estimates that a third of all medical expenditures are for unnecessary or ill-advised treatments, the stakes are enormous. And with Medicare the dominant payer for elderly Americans, who are most likely to need the treatments, its clout, when it insists on studies, is substantial. When Medicare says it will only cover treatments for patients enrolled in such studies, that's ''a pretty big stick,'' said Dr. Stephen Hammill, president of the Heart Rhythm Society.
Dr. West said that he would offer mifepristone, but that he was not happy about it because he thought surgery was much better. ''I'll be forced by market pressures to offer it,'' he said. Dr. Charles Livengood, a gynecologist at Duke University who provides abortions there, also said he preferred surgical abortions. ''I think it's good to have mifepristone available,'' Dr. Livengood said. ''But I do think that an abortion with mifepristone tends to be a prolonged and messy affair as opposed to a quick procedure that I do in the clinic.'' Nonetheless, he has been dutifully presenting it as a possibility to his patients, explaining carefully what taking the drug entails. ''I've presented it to 10, maybe 12 women,'' Dr. Livengood said. ''I haven't had any takers at this point.''
The device costs about $20,000, though, and the operation to insert it, another $10,000. With 400,000 new patients a year who could benefit, and an additional three million patients who have already had serious heart attacks who could be helped, some doctors wonder who is going to pay. Dr. Douglas Zipes, president of the American College of Cardiology, said he and other physicians were bracing for a surge of calls from patients who would want the device. ''It's a difficult situation,'' Dr. Zipes said. ''We're looking at changes that could easily rupture the health care budget.'' The study, which was reported yesterday at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology and will be published tomorrow in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that after an average of 20 months, 19.8 percent of those patients who did not have the devices died, compared with 14.2 percent of those who had them, a 30 percent difference in the death rate.
My husband asked me whether I would stop running if the doctor told me to. I'm not sure, I said. If my foot is broken, I'll stop. If not, I'll have to wait and see. GINA KOLATA FITNESS
Dr. Howard Parnes, who directs prostate cancer research at the National Cancer Institute's division of cancer prevention, responded to the study by saying: ''Now we don't have a clear definition of normal and abnormal. Before these data were out, we were comfortable with the notion that 4 is a cutoff between normal and abnormal. Now these data very clearly tell us that 4 is not a cutoff.'' But the study, which involved 2,940 men aged 62 to 91, was not designed to show what cutoff should be used for P.S.A. levels. And there are no easy answers about whether a man with a low P.S.A. level should have a biopsy, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. Cancers in such men are microscopic -- a doctor cannot feel them -- and there are no symptoms. The biopsy decision may depend on how old the man is, or his family history, or how frightened he is of prostate cancer.
''You are always afraid in the back of your mind that maybe the disease-specific benefit is being bought at the expense of raising your risk of death from other causes.'' He explained: a test finds a cancerous tumor and the patient has chemotherapy or radiation. Years later, the person dies of heart disease, which was actually caused by the cancer treatments, which hurt the heart. If the person had not been tested for cancer and treated, he would have died at the same time of cancer. In this case, with the early detection and treatment, ''you're not better off,'' Dr. Goodman said. Another problem involves the statistics: it can be hard to agree on a cause of death, and without realizing it, researchers may tilt their analysis in favor of the treatment for the disease they are studying. ''If a patient has advanced prostate cancer and then comes into a hospital and dies of pneumonia, that might be written down as a death due to pneumonia,'' said Dr. Timothy Wilt of the Veterans Affairs Center for Chronic Disease Outcomes Research in Minneapolis. Yet, he said, the man might have gotten pneumonia because he was weakened by treatment for his prostate cancer.
Dr. Wogan studied men in Shanghai who were eating foods with high doses of the toxic chemical. They ended up with four times the risk of liver cancer. Another cause of liver cancer, hepatitis B infections of the liver, increases the risk by a factor of seven. Then Dr. Wogan noticed something that astonished him. The risk of liver cancer was increased 70 times in people who met both criteria; they ate contaminated foods and they were infected with hepatitis B. ''It was like a model system forthe environmental causes of cancer,'' Dr. Wogan said. The two cancer-causing agents were amplifying each other's effects. He went on to study the mechanisms of cancer causation and discovered that the more he looked at environmental pollutants the more complex and individualistic the biochemical pathways leading to cancer turned out to be. ''People differ very greatly in their response to chemical carcinogens,'' Dr. Wogan said. ''Almost all chemicals, with relatively few exceptions, have to be converted from what they are into something more chemically active to be carcinogenic.
''That will be a bitter pill to swallow, and I'm not sure people will swallow it,'' Dr. Califf said. ''There's a lot of money being made on things that don't work well.'' Dr. Jencks agreed. ''I would say we are moving much more slowly on trying to prevent overuse than in trying to fix underuse,'' he said. ''If I tell a physician he shouldn't do a surgery he wants to do, I personally would anticipate a lot more resistance than if I told him he should give a medicine he wasn't thinking of giving.''
''Isn't it funny that in the 20th century, self-improvement has become this sort of physical thing?'' she mused. Cosmetics and skin care came of age along with plastic surgery, and they, too, catered to our desires to improve ourselves, seizing on devices like the ubiquitous makeover promoted by women's magazines. In her book ''Hope in a Jar: The Making of America's Beauty Culture'' (Henry Holt), Kathy Peiss, a history professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, told how the industry emerged. Companies noticed early on that women took advertising slogans for cosmetics and soaps to heart. A study commissioned by Woodbury Facial Soap in the early 1920's, for example, found that college students ''quoted advertising slogans verbatim, 'a skin you love to touch,' a 'schoolgirl complexion' -- when describing and evaluating their own faces,'' Professor Peiss writes. Now companies are exploiting the health and beauty image for all it's worth. On Clinique's Web site, you can click on ''What's New'' and learn about ''Superfit Makeup.'' Lancome suggests on its Web site, ''Take a destressing moment with Hydra Zen, Lancome's newest moisturizer.'' Revlon features ''Age-Defying Makeup,'' crowing: ''Don't lie about your age. Defy it.'' Nexxus tells Web page readers to ''Feed your head'' with its hair products. Jergens advertises a ''daily nourishing cream'' with ''alpha and beta hydroxy complex.''
Advertisements for weight loss centers often make it seem that success is guaranteed for anyone who really wants it. They feature smiling, thin, healthy people -- results, the advertisements imply, of simply following the program. Scientists, however, want something more. They would like to see carefully controlled studies that follow program participants over a couple of years and compare their success with that of nonparticipants. But that sort of study is almost never done, said Dr. Thomas Wadden, director of the weight and eating disorders program at the University of Pennsylvania and the lead author of the new study. It is not as if no one has asked the companies to conduct such research, he and others said. About a decade ago, Dr. Wadden, Mr. Cleland and others met with commercial weight loss companies at the Federal Trade Commission to discuss getting some solid data on the programs' effectiveness. ''We tried to come up with a set of voluntary guidelines with the idea that these would be disclosures that weight loss centers would make prior to consumers' signing on the bottom line,'' said Mr. Cleland.
''People didn't get it,'' said Dr. Lowe, who was Dr. Ruley's doctoral student. But as techniques of molecular biology improved, Dr. Lowe and a few others revisited Dr. Ruley's idea and untangled the molecular biology. They discovered that the very cancer gene that makes a cell grow eventually turns on other genes that stop growth. Researchers called the process oncogene-induced cell senescence and said it might be one way to stop a cancer from progressing. ''The cell has a built-in sensor that says 'shut down proliferation' and says 'O.K., that's enough,' '' Dr. Lowe said. ''Then the cells will never divide again. It's a terminal event.'' Dr. Mooi recalled his astonishment. ''It was an amazing finding,'' he said. And it raised an obvious question: Did this happen in humans, or was it an artifact of growing cells in petri dishes? ''There was this conundrum,'' Dr. Lowe said. ''If you couldn't see it in animals, maybe it was not relevant.''
''We did a lot of Internet marketing,'' Ms. Miller said. ''And two years ago I started an academic conference on donor eggs. That got a lot of attention. We also marketed that to the press.'' Other centers lavish referring doctors with gifts and services. Dr. Anthony Caruso, a reproductive endocrinologist in the Chicago area at Midwest Fertility Center, said the center sent referring doctors Christmas gifts like candy and clocks. He said he also assisted other doctors in surgery, free of charge, to ''maintain good will.'' Marketing is one thing when a center is credible, Dr. Rawlins said, adding that RMA and the Columbia clinic, for example, are excellent. But, he said, too many centers' promotions have been fraudulent. Some centers advertised success rates that were the nation's average rather than their own lower rates. Others publicized results from only a small group of patients with good outcomes. Some, Dr. Rawlins said, put patients who are hard to treat into a ''research'' category, excluding their results from the clinic's statistics.
''You start talking to the other parents,'' Ms. Gillick said. '' 'Why? How could that have happened?' '' She found what she thought was the answer: trace levels of industrial chemicals in the drinking water. But the cancer institute and the E.P.A. investigated and said that they saw no particular danger in the water and that what looked like an increase in childhood cancer was just a statistical fluke. Dr. Gallo was sent to talk to Toms River residents. Although Ms. Gillick said that she respected him and his views and that she found him likable, she did not like his message. ''Scientists,'' Ms. Gillick said. ''They think it was random bad luck or whatever. ''We can't sit back and say, 'O.K., it happened.' If we could find the cause of a lot of these cancers, we wouldn't have to worry about the cure.'' That is also the message of the Breast Cancer Action Coalition. ''We think there is something going on, and we'd like to find out what it is,'' said Ms. Brenner, the executive director. ''The scientists who say these kinds of environmental exposure are the smallest contributors, I'd like to know how they know that. If we haven't done the research, how can they say with assurance what is the contributor to anything?''
Dr. Harris also looked at heavy smokers. Among those who regularly took aspirin, he found, lung cancer risk seemed to be reduced by 60 percent. Once again, acetaminophen had no effect. But, Dr. Hawk said, such studies fall short of making the case. While there were dozens of studies involving hundreds of thousands of people looking at a wide array of cancers, not all showed an effect. The data, he said, ''were a bit equivocal.'' In recent years, he said, the accumulating data on prevention of stomach and esophageal cancer and breast cancer became more compelling. But still, by itself the work raised questions about whether aspirin really was protective. The studies, however, were bolstered by laboratory research showing how the drugs might work. Scientists had learned that aspirin and drugs like it block two similar enzymes, cyclooxygenase-1, or cox-1, and cyclooxygenase-2, or cox-2. (The prescription drugs, Vioxx and Celebrex, block only cox-2.)
''In fact, there's an opportunity to get very, very low,'' said Dr. Christie M. Ballantyne, a cardiologist at Baylor College of Medicine. ''Can we be reducing L.D.L. by 50 percent routinely? The answer is yes. What we still don't know is, is it O.K.? What will that mean in terms of costs of drugs, side effects of drugs, prevention of heart attacks?'' ''This study is a proof of concept,'' Dr. Ballantyne said. ''As compared to cancer, we can stop this disease process in a fairly predictable way and prevent most heart attacks from ever happening.'' Correction:  November 20, 2003, Thursday  A front-page article last Thursday about a study comparing two of the cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins referred incompletely to the manufacturer of a third drug, Zetia, which helps prevent the body from absorbing cholesterol. It is made by Merck &amp; Company not alone but in a joint venture with the Schering-Plough Corporation.
''They really don't show a huge increase in the incidence of cancer,'' Dr. Applebaum said. For example, researchers looked at people whose immune systems were suppressed because they were taking drugs to prevent rejection of a transplanted organ or because they had AIDS. ''There are small increases in certain types of cancers,'' Dr. Applebaum said, but those tend to be cancers that are associated with infections -- like stomach cancer, associated with ulcer-causing Helicobacter pylori; liver cancer, associated with hepatitis B and hepatitis C infections; Kaposi's sarcoma, associated with herpesvirus 8 infections; lymphoma, associated with Epstein-Barr virus; and cervical cancer, associated with human papillomavirus. ''The common types of cancer, the ones that cause the huge burden of suffering in humans, really aren't increased,'' he said. What happens to the immune system in cancer patients? It should be protecting them. Every tissue of the body is larded with white blood cells, and cancers are no exception. In fact, Dr. Pardoll said, in some tumors, including melanomas and kidney cancers, white blood cells make up 50 percent of the cancer's weight.
The concern, Dr. Cassileth said, is that cancer patients, under enormous stress, often worry that they are hurting their own prognosis. And patients who look back over their lives and remember that they went through stressful times before their diagnosis often conclude they brought the cancer on themselves. ''People need answers,'' Dr. Cassileth said. For many, a diagnosis of cancer is a complete shock. They thought that they were healthy; they were exercising and eating right. ''They are at a loss to understand why that happened to them,'' she said. And, she added, all people can find stress in their lives if they look for it. ''I tell them they did not cause their cancer. Absolutely not,'' Dr. Cassileth said. The question for Dr. Drew Pardoll, director of the cancer immunology program at Johns Hopkins' Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, was not whether stress causes cancer. It was how cancers can even exist.
It was, Dr. Friedman recalled, almost a religious experience to find that molecule. ''Here is this simple hormone that solves the problem of how to track millions of calories over a lifetime,'' he said. ''I actually found it quite humbling that this was around all the time.'' Dr. Friedman named the molecule leptin, derived from the Greek root leptos, meaning thin. ''The idea is that in the absence of leptin you're fat, so leptin keeps you thin,'' he explained. Over the next few months, he and his colleagues accumulated evidence that, in mice at least, when leptin was missing, the brain responded by sending constant signals to the body to eat, eat, eat, and the animals grew immense. With leptin injections, the animals stopped eating and lost weight. He also discovered that humans, too, made leptin. Rockefeller University applied for a patent on the discovery, and a biotechnology company, Amgen of Thousand Oaks, Calif., licensed the commercial rights for $20 million.  Dr. Friedman got part of the money. Suddenly obesity research was transformed. Obesity, it seemed, might be caused by a leptin deficiency, and treating it might be as simple as supplying fat people with the hormone.
''It's not like there's an explosion of new back pain,'' said Dr. Steven Atlas, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who investigates back treatments. ''The number of cases isn't increasing; the cost per case is increasing. There is a lot more that is being done, but the issue is, Is it helping or not?'' Back pain has always been around, like headaches, or the common cold. What has changed, doctors say, are people's expectations. ''People say, 'I'm not going to put up with it,' '' Dr. Deyo said. ''And we in the medical profession have turned to ever more aggressive medication, narcotic medication, surgery, more invasive surgery.'' But studies find little evidence that patients are better off for all the treatment. Researchers asked, for example, what is the meaning of disk abnormalities, so often seen when a back patient undergoes an magnetic resonance imaging, or M.R.I.? So they examined people with no back pain. One study, of 98 people, found that two-thirds had problems like bulging or protruding disks, herniated disks and degenerated disks. A third had more than one abnormal disk.
Ronald Remy, 52, a retired purchasing agent for the state government, worried about heart disease. His brother had had quadruple bypass surgery, and he himself was feeling fatigued. A stress test showed nothing wrong, he said, but his brother had also had a stress test that showed nothing wrong. ''The worry wears on you,'' he said. After my brother's bypass, I had nightmares.'' Mr. Remy brushed off medical authorities' concerns about the scans. ''I'd rather be safe than sorry,'' he said. Dr. William Casarella, chairman of the department of radiology at Emory University, says that argument is a bit too seductive. Dr. Casarella should know, because he inadvertently ventured into the world of unforeseen consequences from a scan. It began when he had a virtual colonoscopy, a new test in which a CT scanner examines the colon for polyps. His colon was normal but other parts of his body, that show up in the scan, were not. ''A renal mass was detected, as was a liver mass as were multiple nodules in the base of my lungs,'' Dr. Casarella said.
''This is something that the biotech industry, as it develops more and more drugs, will have to come to grips with,'' said Carl B. Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization. ''It's not that we are lacking compassion, but the economics are tough.'' The issue is especially difficult when it comes to drugs, like Dr. Lange's, that do not save lives but can vastly improve the quality of life. Nobody knows for sure how many patients in other countries have had to forgo drugs that improved their lives when clinical trials ended, and companies do not give out patients' names, to protect their privacy. But the issue is very much on the minds of company researchers and executives. Ethicists say that they, too, are troubled but that their field has reached no consensus on what companies should do. ''Do we have an obligation to everyone in the trial or to everyone in the community, the province, the nation, the region of the world?'' asked Dr. Ruth Faden, the director of the Phoebe R. Berman Bioethics Institute at Johns Hopkins University. ''We haven't really figured this out.''
Then a 6-year-old boy came in, shot in the back while he was outside playing hide-and-seek. The bullet struck his liver and the child was bleeding so profusely that no one thought he could survive. Once again, staff members rolled up their sleeves. ''He lived,'' Colonel Keenan said. ''It was amazing. He was so near death's door.'' She was haunted by the incidents. ''They were doing that back in the Civil War,'' she said. ''I just kept thinking: 'Don't we have a blood substitute yet? Aren't we working on one?' '' She said she could not imagine why the Defense Department had not developed, perfected and tested artificial blood. In 2000, after she had returned to the United States and begun working as a Congressional fellow for Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas, she found out why. She visited Colonel Holcomb, who told her that he knew of promising substances like artificial blood but that he could not do anything to hasten their testing and approval.
''Women deserve access at any time, at any age, for any reason,'' a young woman from the Gainesville, Fla., area chapter of the National Organization for Women told the panel. ''I braved football-game traffic to go to the campus infirmary,'' she said, but it was closed. ''I had no idea where I could get it,'' and so, she said, she just hoped for the best. Opponents said the data did not convince them that the drug was safe enough to be so freely available. Judy Brown, president of the American Life League, said, ''The pill acts to prevent a pregnancy by aborting a child.'' Ms. Brown added that while Plan B may be called emergency contraception ''the emergency in this case is a baby.'' Committee members urged that the drug's actions be described so that women understood that a fertilized egg might be disrupted. Others argued that for teenagers pregnancy was a far worse alternative.
Yet, in all the enthusiasm over these diets most say that their very basis was disproved years ago. But the promoters take another tack. Some say their diets attack the very cause of obesity, which they say is carbohydrates. Dr. Barry Sears, who created the Zone diet, puts it this way: ''too much carbohydrate means too much insulin, and too much insulin takes you out of the Zone. Out of the Zone, you put on excess body fat and you can't get rid of it.'' Alas, there are no magical foods to make you gain or lose weight. All that matters is calories. It makes no difference if those calories are in fats or vegetables or cake or ice cream. The evidence includes a paper published in 1992 in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition by Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel, Dr. Jules Hirsch and colleagues at Rockefeller University. They put people on a metabolic ward where they could precisely control every calorie consumed. The subjects were on diets with widely different compositions, fat contents ranging from 0 to 70 percent. It made no difference. All that mattered to their weight was number of calories consumed.
The panel urged that people whose risk was 20 percent or more be treated as aggressively as patients who had just had a heart attack. That almost always means the immediate use of cholesterol-lowering treatments, most often statins -- powerful drugs that can slash cholesterol levels by blocking a liver enzyme crucial to cholesterol production. The panel also urged these high-risk people to follow cholesterol-lowering diets, exercise and lose weight. People with diabetes are now automatically put into the high-risk category. Previously, diabetes was considered simply another risk factor, rather than a danger sign so glaring that it was as if the person had already had a heart attack. ''The medical community is pretty well attuned to the fact that if you had a heart attack, you are at high risk for having another one,'' Dr. Cleeman said. ''But what is not well known is that there are other people who are at just as high risk.''
But many people, including doctors, wonder if they should plan for medical emergencies or for a sudden diagnosis of a serious disease and, if so, how. That is what troubled Dr. Peter K. Lindenauer, an internist and medical researcher at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Mass., and Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. At parties and at family gatherings, he said, friends, relatives and acquaintances often sidled up to him and asked for advice about where to go for medical care. He would tell them that if they had something as common as pneumonia or needed surgery for something as mundane as a hernia, they probably would do at least as well at a small local hospital as they would at a major medical center. But, he said, ''those comments were based more on gut than on actual evidence.'' He decided to look for proof. Dr. Lindenauer and his colleagues began looking at national data on two common conditions: pneumonia, the fifth-leading cause of death in America, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema and is the fourth-leading cause of death. ''When we think about bread-and-butter medical problems, these are the classic ones,'' Dr. Lindenauer said.
The effort is crucial because the contradiction has vast implications, not just for women's health but for medical research in general. This does not mean that doctors are changing their new advice on hormone therapy. In the wake of the Women's Health Initiative, even many who once advocated the drugs after menopause now say women should use them only to relieve unbearable symptoms, like severe hot flashes, and should take them for the shortest possible time. Even if it turns out that the drugs do protect some women against heart disease -- that the Women's Health Initiative did not tell the whole story -- there are better ways of doing it, medical experts say, than taking drugs that also confer other risks. But as their efforts to reconcile the two studies continue to fall short, the experts continue to worry. ''If there are such discrepancies, how many other medical facts do we believe based on one type of study or another type of study because we don't have the luxury of having both?'' asked Dr. Isaac Schiff, the chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.
People of Valentin Keller's era, like those before and after them, expected to develop chronic diseases by their 40's or 50's. Keller's descendants had lung problems, they had heart problems, they had liver problems. They died in their 50's or 60's. Now, though, life has changed. The family's baby boomers are reaching middle age and beyond and are doing fine. ''I feel good,'' says Keller's great-great-great-grandson Craig Keller. At 45, Mr. Keller says he has no health problems, nor does his 45-year-old wife, Sandy. The Keller family illustrates what may prove to be one of the most striking shifts in human existence -- a change from small, relatively weak and sickly people to humans who are so big and robust that their ancestors seem almost unrecognizable. New research from around the world has begun to reveal a picture of humans today that is so different from what it was in the past that scientists say they are startled. Over the past 100 years, says one researcher, Robert W. Fogel of the University of Chicago, humans in the industrialized world have undergone ''a form of evolution that is unique not only to humankind, but unique among the 7,000 or so generations of humans who have ever inhabited the earth.''
Yesterday morning, the breast implant documents appeared on the Food and Drug Administration Web site, voluminous files constituting one company's arguments for bringing silicone breast implants back on the market. The files included laboratory data, animal studies, data from a decade of large epidemiological studies conducted after implants were removed from the market in 1992 and the company's own studies, over several years, following women who had had its implants. For example, data from the company, the Inamed Corporation, showed, unsurprisingly, that silicone implants could rupture or lead to complications like scarring and that many must be removed or replaced after a period of time. But the company argues that the devices are generally safe, with no links to serious diseases like lupus or cancer, as has been asserted. The posting of the files is a formal prelude to an all-but-unprecedented F.D.A. meeting next week, in sessions scheduled to run from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Tuesday and 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Wednesday.
But the situation can be different when a drug is not urgently needed for patients with an otherwise lethal disease. Dr. Richard J. Wurtman, a co-founder of Interneuron, a small drug company in Lexington, Mass., was convinced that melatonin worked as a sleeping pill if the dose was correct. He wanted to test and market it as a drug. But when he urged this course on his company, he said, he was met with '' absolutely zero interest.'' ''The problem is convincing a company in this country to invest the tens of millions of dollars to get the drug on the market and then have it come out and compete with a supplement,'' Dr. Wurtman said. ''As long as something is available as a dietary supplement, no company will invest in it.'' And so Interneuron joined the supplement makers. It is marketing melatonin as a supplement that can induce sleep, through a subsidiary called InterNutria.
Doctors and health policy experts differ on whether the trend is to be lauded, accepted or deplored. But they agree that it was inevitable, a consequence of peoples' growing irritation with impersonal medical care by rushed doctors and a booming economy that allows many people to pay for the service they want. Dr. Thomas Reardon, a general practitioner who is president of the American Medical Association, said that his organization had no policy on the trend, but that he understood why it was occurring. ''What the doctors are saying is, 'We're tired of managed care, we're tired of Medicare, we're tired of the hassle,' '' Dr. Reardon said. Patients are equally peeved by much of medical care today, he added. But some worry about a loss of fundamental equity and justice, that the affluent are insulating themselves. ''We are in an incredibly entrepreneurial climate in medicine, and I think this kind of tiering undercuts people's thinking about collective solutions to the health care problems,'' said Norman Daniels, a professor of philosophy at Tufts University who specializes in ethics and health care..
The promise is that robots will enable heart surgeons to fulfill their longstanding dream of less invasive, less traumatic operations. Bypass surgery is indisputably effective. When surgeons use the mammary artery in the chest to bypass a blockage, the results usually last for decades. But it is not easy for the patients. With bypass surgery, surgeons typically saw into the patient's breastbone and crack open the ribs, making a hole from just below the neck to just above the navel. Even worse, surgeons said, are the heart-lung machines, which allow doctors to operate on a still, bloodless heart.  The machine's plastic tubing elicits an inflammatory response and the medications that are used to prevent the blood from clotting in the machine can cause bleeding problems and organ damage. About 1 percent of patients have strokes and as many as a third have measurable memory loss, including an inability to perform simple mental tasks like calculations and figure recognition. Many patients also suffer depression after bypass surgery with heart-lung machines.
''If you have a 6-year-old girl,  which I have in my practice, and she's got breast development and she's growing pubic and axillary hair, she will menstruate,'' Dr. Bachrach said. ''She will have a shortened growing time. And the other implication is psychosocial distress. These girls look older but psychologically they are still 6 years old or 7 years old and they are not ready for it.''
But the cure some scientists are proposing would require a startling change in national policy. The policy today, said Dr. Arnold S. Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan who is chairman of a federal vaccine policy subcommittee, is to give the vaccine to old people, infants, those with chronic illnesses and those who care for high-risk people. But, he added, most of those at high risk are the least likely people to get the flu, because they have little contact with those who spread the disease. ''We've always been vaccinating not to prevent flu but to prevent complications in people who are least likely to get the flu -- but who, if they get it, get into real trouble,'' Dr. Monto said. The new idea is to focus on those who unwittingly turn an isolated virus into a widespread epidemic. ''It's very clear who is transmitting the flu, and how they are connected,'' says Dr. Ira M. Longini Jr., a statistician at Emory. ''It is very clearly schoolchildren.''
Cardiologists say the study addresses a question that plagues them: How low should cholesterol go? National guidelines call for lowering L.D.L. levels in heart disease patients to less than 100 milligrams per deciliter of blood. But, said Dr. Daniel Rader, a lipid researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, ''one of the big issues is, 'Is that enough?' '' And, he added, ''Where do you stop?'' And what about people with high cholesterol levels who have not had a heart attack or other manifestation of heart disease? Should they, too, go for maximum L.D.L. lowering? What if the only risk factor is a high level of L.D.L.? Current guidelines suggest less aggressive L.D.L. lowering for people at lower risk. ''There's a certain inconsistency,'' Dr. Rader said. ''If you are trying to reduce risk, once you make decision to put someone on a drug, why not target the same level for everyone?''
When word got out recently that two radiology centers in Portland, Ore., were offering a new screening test for the early detection of lung cancer, the response was overwhelming. Smokers and former smokers jammed the centers' phones, demanding the simple, painless test that can find lung cancers so tiny that they can be snipped out and, doctors hope, the patients cured. In a single day, more than 300 people called one of the centers, Epic Imaging. ''I got in at 6:30 that morning and didn't get off the phone until 6:30 that night,'' said Melanie Haymond, a marketing director there. Drawn by newspaper articles and Epic's brochures describing the test as ''fast, inexpensive, lifesaving,'' patients readily agreed to Epic's  $295 fee, even though the test is not covered by most health insurance policies because it is considered experimental. They even agreed to pay half of the money at the time of the test, as Epic required.
Correction:  December 8, 2003, Monday  An article in Science Times on Tuesday about a study comparing traditional colonoscopy with virtual colonoscopy -- an X-ray of the colon with a C.T. scanner -- reversed a finding on patients' perception of the procedures. About 54 percent of the 1,233 patients said virtual colonoscopy was more uncomfortable, and about 38 percent said the traditional kind was more uncomfortable. (About 8 percent were undecided.)
Dr. Flockhart, for one, bemoans the opportunities lost because DNA was not stored in clinical trials in the past. ''It really is an indictment of the oncology community,'' he said. Dr. Richard Weinshilboum, a pharmacogenetics researcher at the Mayo Clinic, said that may be changing. More and more studies are collecting and storing participants' DNA, and there is increasing interest in looking for genetic variations that may determine whether a person responds to a particular drug. The change has been a long time coming, Dr. Weinshilboum added. ''It has frustrated me to see the pace,'' he said. ''Sometimes from my perspective, it has been a glacial pace. But I think we have to be patient. Those of us who do the research are sometimes the least patient in trying to get the research out.'' But, he added, ''We want to be sure it's right.'' PROSPECTS
Even though the current cases in Florida, New York, New Jersey and Washington are being intensely studied, they have not yet yielded data to answer some of the most basic questions. Of particular concern is inhalation anthrax, the most dangerous form of the disease. Much of what is known about how it progresses was learned from 1993 research about an outbreak in the Soviet Union that occurred in 1979. Anthrax spores were accidentally released from a germ warfare laboratory in Sverdlovsk, infecting at least 96 people and killing at least 68, but just how many people suffered symptoms and many other details remain mysteries. And as the recent cases show, the survival rate is unknown, whether or not the disease is treated with antibiotics. So far, in seven confirmed cases of inhalation anthrax, three  have died. The recent attacks also raise questions about how many spores are inhaled in those who become ill. Textbooks say 8,000 to 10,000 spores. But, said Dr. Marguerite A. Neill, an infectious disease expert at Brown University, those estimates are based on studies decades ago of workers who handled animal hides.
A new study by an independent researcher has found that coaching for college admission tests has only a small effect, despite the claims of companies and private tutors who have turned test preparation into a multimillion-dollar industry. The study's data, from a national sample of more than 14,000 students, indicated that the average gain from coaching was no more than about 20 points on the 1,600-point SAT test. The study found coaching produced similarly small improvements in English and math for students taking the ACT, a test used by many colleges that do not use the SAT. Coaching actually seemed to have slightly lowered scores on the reading part of the ACT. The findings support the longstanding contention of the College Board, which sponsors the SAT, that test coaching has little effect. But the study, reported in the current issue of Chance, a magazine of the American Statistical Association, had several flaws. The study did not differentiate between intensive and expensive preparation courses that may last for months, and short, even one-day courses. Officials of major preparation companies said this failing called the results into question.
But patients with mild cognitive impairment still have insight, and they and their doctors say it can be a curse. They know too well what the future may hold. ''Many have family histories and they have watched the disease process play out in close family members,'' Dr. Petersen said. ''That's very frightening. We see depression, anger, 'Why me?' We see anxiety develop because people start to lose their grasp of things.'' Many take drugs that have been approved for Alzheimer's or take substances like vitamin E that researchers hope might help. But for now, Dr. Petersen said, ''there have been no clinical trials that demonstrate that anything works or doesn't work -- they are all under way.'' Yet patients like Ms. Hoard can describe their lives in a way that people with Alzheimer's cannot. Life, as she describes it, can be achingly lonely. Even keeping up with a conversation can be a struggle because she cannot remember what was just said.
Researchers who have occasional success cloning one species, like cows, are meeting failure with others, like dogs. For them -- even for the scientists who made Dolly -- cloning success is the exception, not the rule. A vast majority of efforts fail, even in species that have at one time or another been cloned. Still, cloning technology is potentially highly useful, so researchers keep trying. Companies are cloning to make copies of valuable animals. They also are cloning to genetically modify animals so that humans can use their organs or so that the animals will secrete useful medicines in their milk. But, cloning experts say, the day when scientists can easily, reproducibly and routinely produce a bountiful supply of cloned animals -- or people -- seems far in the distant future. Now Dr. Dominko works for Advanced Cell Technology, the Worcester, Mass., company that is a vigorous advocate of commercial cloning technology, and that made the startling assertion last month that it was trying to clone humans.
But the results were clear: there was no association between stressful events in the previous five years and a diagnosis of breast cancer. Other studies had the same result. Still, not everyone was convinced. Critics told Dr. Newcomb and her colleague, Dr. Felicia Roberts, that they had measured stressors, not stress. And Dr. Newcomb had to agree that they had a point. She chose stressful life events as a surrogate for experienced stress, but it is not easy to measure the actual physiological stress that people experience and then follow them to see if they got cancer. Barrie Cassileth, chief of the integrative medicine service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, suggested that there was another way to ask the question. ''These are what we call natural experiments in the real world,'' Dr. Cassileth said. ''Look at situations of extreme stress or distress -- being in a concentration camp, being a prisoner of war. How about a mother losing a child?
And the studies were criticized by gynecologists, in particular, who pointed out that most of the women were long past menopause. Did the findings really apply, they asked, to younger women, in their 50s, who had just entered menopause? To get an answer to that question, the investigators combined data from both studies and asked about health risks in the 50s, 60s and 70s. They concluded in their new analysis that while women in their 50s taking Prempro or estrogen alone had a slightly increased risk of strokes and breast cancer, there was no increase in their risk of heart attacks. ''That is somewhat reassuring,'' Dr. Rossouw said. He suggested that if women in their 50s wanted to take hormone therapy to relieve menopause symptoms, they should be sure their blood pressure was controlled and they should have regular mammograms. But the result does not mean, Dr. Rossouw added, that if women start taking hormones in their 50s, they can safely continue into their 60s and 70s.
Dr. Barry Zirkin, a reproductive biologist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, is less sanguine. ''I think it's important not to rush to ICSI,'' Dr. Zirkin said. ''There's a lot we don't understand.'' Dr. Zirkin said that if he were infertile he would adopt. ''But that's me,'' he said. Couples who choose ICSI, Dr. Zirkin said, ''need to understand what we know for sure -- that you can get a baby -- and what we don't know for sure -- a lot about what that baby is going to be like and what his or her offspring are going to be like.'' Dr. Schatten said he knew from personal experience the emotional pull to have a baby and the reluctance of many couples to use a sperm donor when the man's sperm are inadequate. He said he understood the importance of ICSI and the reason many do not want the technique taken away while scientists spend years, even decades, studying whether the method could affect the genes of the children conceived with it.
Craig and Sandy Keller had all the advantages of middle-class Americans of their age: childhood vaccines, plenty of food, antibiotics when they fell ill. Now, wanting to stay healthy, they walk in the evenings, try to eat well and rely on their strong faith, which, they say, makes a big difference to their health. And they enjoy life. Mr. Keller pulls his wife's tan Chevy Malibu into the driveway of his small, immaculate house on a sidewalk-lined street. It is the same house that he grew up in; he and Mrs. Keller bought it from Mr. Keller's parents 22 years ago. While Mrs. Keller brings out a snack of a homemade cheese ball, crackers, sandwiches, fruit salad and brownies, Mr. Keller settles in to marvel at the contrast between his comfortable life and the lives of his ancestors. For him, the idea of falling ill in his late 20's and never working again is unimaginable. He knows, though, that he is nearing the age when many of his ancestors died. His father, Carl D. Keller, a lifelong smoker, developed prostate cancer, then emphysema, and then lung cancer, which killed him at age 65. His father's father, Carl W. Keller, also a smoker, died of cancer of the esophagus just after he turned 69. His grandfather on his mother's side died of cirrhosis of the liver at 55; his grandmother died at 56 of breast cancer.
But raising doubts about the heart rate formula is unlikely to lead people to abandon it, exercise physiologists say. What would they do without it? ''I've kind of laughed about it over the years,'' Dr. Haskell said. The formula, he said, ''was never supposed to be an absolute guide to rule people's training.'' But, he said, ''It's so typical of Americans to take an idea and extend it beyond what it was originally intended for.'' Correction:  April 26, 2001, Thursday  Because of an editing error, an article in Science Times on Tuesday about maximum heart rates misstated the doctoral credential of William Haskell, an inventor of the common formula for calculating a person's rate. He is a Ph.D., not an M.D.
''There is a reason to be cautious,'' Dr. Cleeman said, ''and I hope it will be heard.''
''I came back from lunch prepared to vote no,'' Dr. Dubler said. But she reversed herself after hearing Inamed's plans to educate women and doctors, to monitor women and to supply data on the device's safety after it is approved. If the agency follows the committee's advice, silicone breast implants will have made a remarkable comeback after a highly public and explosive fall from grace. The devices have been largely unavailable since 1992, when the Food and Drug Administration asked manufacturers to withdraw them from the market, citing concerns that data on their safety were lacking. In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of women sued the implant makers, some saying the devices had caused serious ailments like autoimmune disease, neurological diseases, chronic fatigue syndrome and cancer. ''There used to be 10 companies making implants, said Dr. Michael Miller, a panel member who is a plastic surgeon at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. ''The competition has been destroyed.''
Dr. Caballero said that for some supplements, including vitamin A, the difference between the recommended dose and a dose that could lead to bad outcomes like osteoporosis was not large. Popular multivitamins, he added, often contain what could be risky doses. ''Certainly,'' he said, ''by consuming supplements, people can reach that level.'' Doctors who once told patients that multivitamins were, at worst, a waste of money now say they are questioning that idea. ''All of a sudden, scientists are rearing back and saying, 'Wait a minute, do we really know that we need this and do we really know that we need that?' '' said Dr. Ruth Kava, nutrition director at the American Council on Science and Health, a consumer foundation in Manhattan that is in part financed by industry. With vitamin A in particular, it is easy to step over the edge into a danger zone, said Dr. Joan McGowan, chief of the musculoskeletal diseases branch at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases.
''The Bob Masseys are probably about 1 to 2 percent of the people infected with H.I.V.,'' Dr. Rosenberg said. ''There are a lot of Bob Masseys who don't even know they are infected.'' And that led Dr. Walker and Dr. Rosenberg to ask: how could they make other people like Bob Massey? The critical events, they decided, take place in the first days or weeks after the virus enters the body. That is when the helper T-cells, the generals, start proliferating and signaling the killer T-cells to attack the virus. But the problem is that these very same activated helper T-cells are the target of the AIDS virus. ''These guys are trying to get activated to do their thing,'' Dr. Walker said. ''But what they're saying is: Here we are. Shoot us down. Knock us off.'' What was needed, he said, was a protective shield for these cells. Dr. Walker and Dr. Rosenberg came up with a strategy. They would find people who had just been infected with H.I.V., as the virus was dividing so vigorously that people could have as many as a hundred million viruses in each drop of blood. That is when most people become acutely ill. And that is when the helper T-cells are galvanized.
Scientific evidence has not shown that women can avoid the breast cancer risk from hormone replacement therapy by taking the drugs for only a short time, researchers said today. It also has not shown that the risk disappears as soon as the drugs are stopped. The questions about when the risk develops and how long it lasts arose after a large federal study of hormone replacement therapy reported in July that the drugs' risks, including a slight increase in the incidence of breast cancer, were not exceeded by their benefits. The study was halted after five years when researchers found that the women taking hormones had a clear increase in their incidence of breast cancer. At a meeting here today, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Rowan T. Chlebowski, of the Harbor-U.C.L.A. Research and Education Institute, reported that even women who took the hormones for some period but then stopped had more breast cancer than those who never took the hormones.
Prescriptions for anabolic steroids have soared in recent years, to 1.5 million in 2001 from 806,000 in 1997, according to IMS Health, a company that monitors drug sales. But it is impossible to know how much is being taken for legitimate medical needs. By all accounts, a small minority of Americans use the drugs, but medical experts are concerned. Their concern is over their own ignorance: who uses the drugs, why, for how long, and what are the medical consequences? Is it acceptable or recklessly dangerous to use them to alter the body? There have been no rigorous medical studies to provide answers to fundamental questions about long-term safety. ''There are concerns that on the one hand there may be something good here, but on the other hand there may be a public health problem brewing,'' said Dr. Marc Blackman, the clinical director and chief of the laboratory of clinical investigation at the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health. ''The problem is substantial, and the chasm of ignorance is huge.''
But the question is, Does finding a lung cancer so early mean that patients will live longer? The first major papers on the spiral CT scanning were published in April 1998 and last July. Ordinarily, a period of years would follow during which the method would be studied in groups of patients to learn if the early results were easily replicated. But medical experts at a workshop held in a hotel here said the usual languid period of waiting to start a clinical study would not suffice. A large study in which possibly tens of  thousands of patients are randomly assigned to have the screening test or not must start immediately, they said, or it will be too late. Already, they said, patients are lining up to have the scan and hospitals are advertising that they will provide it. Dr. Christine Berg, the acting chief of the lung and upper aerodigestive cancer research group at the National Cancer Institute, who oversaw the meeting, said the institute's advisory board had already urged that a large study be undertaken. And now, with most of the participants at the meeting today saying the same, she said she would urge that planning begin.
Companies like Covance and Russian Clinical Trials say it is not their business to ask what happens when the studies end. ''What our clients choose to do is not our affair,'' Dr. Wood of Covance said. Ethicists acknowledge that companies are businesses and accountable to investors. Drug companies, said Dr. Lawrence O. Gostin, the director of the Center for Law and the Public's Health at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities, should not be seen as ''the deep pocket that helps everyone.'' But on the other hand, Dr. Gostin said, there is something troubling about ''parachute research,'' in which a company drops into a country, conducts its research and then leaves. ''It raises the question of what ethical obligation, if any, there might be to give back and make sure there is access to the drug after the trials are over,'' Dr. Gostin said. The participants in a study take a risk to help a company determine if its drug is safe and effective, he said, and ''it seems to me that there is an ethical obligation to give back.''
Dr. Rudolph Jaenisch, a professor of biology at the Whitehead Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said that the way Dr. Schatten inserted genes into the monkey eggs -- with a modified virus -- had been used for more than a quarter century in mice. But, Dr. Jaenisch said, those experiments in mice and other animals also revealed the method's limitations. While the modified virus can get the genes into egg DNA, he said, the problem is that the genes are usually silenced and inactive, so that they do not direct cells to make proteins. To make a monkey with a human disease, Dr. Jaenisch said, it is not enough just to get the gene into cells. ''You need whopping expression'' of the gene, he said, meaning that cells must make copious amount of the protein. Moreover, he said, the method only allows for the creation of animals with added genes, while most human genetic diseases arise because a gene is missing or mutated.
As many as 10 million women who have had hysterectomies and who no longer have a cervix are still getting Pap tests, a new study finds. The screening Pap test looks for precancerous cells in tissue scraped from a woman's cervix and can prevent what would otherwise be a common and deadly cancer. But testing most women without a cervix makes little sense, leads to false positives and wastes money, said Dr. Brenda E. Sirovich, a research associate at the Outcomes Group at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt., and the study's lead author. Each test costs $20 to $40, she estimated. The women in question do not include the 1.1 million who had a hysterectomy and still have a cervix, which is at the base of the uterus, nor the 2.2 million who had their uteruses and cervices removed because they had cancer or precancerous cells in their cervix. (Doctors occasionally leave the cervix behind in hysterectomies, although a large study found no particular advantage to doing so.) In both of these groups, Pap tests are warranted. But most women who have their uteruses and cervices removed do so for reasons other than cancer, like noncancerous fibroid tumors, Dr. Sirovich said.
The Drug Companies  First-Time Step In Joint Research Hidden in the rolling countryside near Hopewell, N.J., in a cluster of brick buildings once owned by Mobil Oil is Bristol-Myers Squibb's budding center of pharmacogenomics research. There, in echoing offices still under construction, Dr. Elliott Sigal makes bold plans to expand his staff and investments in what he believes will be the future of the drug industry. When executives like Dr. Sigal look at the pharmaceutical industry, they groan. One out of 7,500 compounds that looks promising in the laboratory actually gets to the market. Only 3 out of 10 that are marketed make any money for the company. ''Our attrition rate is a plague for the industry,'' Dr. Sigal said, referring to the many drugs that fail. Typically, said Dr. Sigal, who is Bristol-Myer's senior vice president for early discovery and applied technology, major drug companies introduce one innovative drug into the market each year -- if they are lucky. For many drugs, he added, only half of the patients who take them respond.
''The vast majority of back pain is what doctors call self-limited -- the condition will improve on its own without therapy. Nevertheless, they constitute a lot of office visits, and there isn't a lot we can offer besides reassurance.'' Strains and pains, the bane of people who are exercising, also tend to go away with or without a doctor's attention, and there usually is little other than ice and rest that can be done. Some injuries take weeks to heal, others take months. Often there is an obvious cause and obvious solution. Usually, it is doing too much too soon, like suddenly increasing the distance you are running. Dr. Paul Thompson, a cardiologist at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut who also is an avid runner, said that with sports injuries, people could save themselves a lot of time and trouble if they would ''kind of troubleshoot things.'' Did your hamstring pain arise just after you changed your running shoes? Or, sports medicine doctors suggest, did your knees start to hurt when you got a new bike? Probably the seat is too low or too high.
Maybe it is their weight: they were heavier, on average, than those in the nurses' study. Since body fat produces its own estrogen, the added hormones they took might have pushed them over a threshold where heart attack risk would emerge. Moreover, two-thirds were over 60 when they joined the study and started taking hormones. In contrast, most women in the nurses' study and ones like it started taking hormones at menopause. But those explanations do not appear to be enough, said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a researcher at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who was an investigator in the two studies. Women who were 50 to 59 when they joined the Women's Health Initiative had the same increased risk of heart disease with hormone therapy as the older women in the study. Thinner women in that study, whose body fat was comparable to those in the nurses' study, also were not protected from heart attacks when they took hormones.
The Food and Drug Administration is actively seeking reports of possible problems with a stent that came on the market last month, saying it has heard of serious medical complications in some cases. But Dr. Daniel G. Schultz, director of the agency's office of device evaluation, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that it was too soon to say whether there was a problem with the stent and, if so, what was causing it and what advice to give doctors and patients. The F.D.A. knows of 20 to 25 incidents, Dr. Schultz said, but the reports range from sketchy to highly detailed. ''We're fairly early in the process'' of assessing the reports, Dr. Schultz said. ''At this stage, our main goal is to gather more information.'' The device's maker, Boston Scientific, says that its stent is safe and is performing excellently and that any problems are extraordinarily rare. Paul LaViolette, senior vice president at the company, said more than 70,000 of the stents had been used in the United States since the device went on sale in March.
The volunteer, Ellen Roche, died on June 2, a month after she inhaled an unapproved drug as part of a research study to examine the causes of asthma. Her lungs were destroyed, apparently by the chemical she inhaled, hexamethonium. She was 24 and a technician at Johns Hopkins. Hopkins officials reacted with outrage to the suspension of research, issuing a statement calling the action ''unwarranted, unnecessary, paralyzing and precipitous'' and ''an extreme example of regulatory excess.'' They pointed out that the suspension could have ''potentially devastating'' effects, stopping studies that included cancer patients receiving experimental drugs. The university said that tens of thousands of people had volunteered for its medical studies and that Ms. Roche was the only one who had died. And, the medical center said, it had recognized its deficiencies and had taken action to correct them. The continuing examination of what went wrong at Hopkins has raised broader questions about how tightly the government should regulate academic research. The Food and Drug Administration says scientists should seek its approval for any study involving new or unusual uses of drugs, but the agency does not police the universities to make sure they comply. Some researchers have sought F.D.A. approval, but others, like the researcher at Hopkins, have not. Hopkins says the F.D.A. has not made its policy clear.
In both studies, financed by the cancer institute, the subjects were men and women who had had at least one polyp, a tiny noncancerous growth, removed from the colon. Such people face a heightened risk of developing new polyps. And since many colon cancers start out as polyps, people who have had polyps also face an increased risk of developing colon cancer. The question was, Can a special diet protect these people from developing new polyps? If so, cancer experts reasoned, the diet might protect them from colon cancer. One study, lasting four years, involved 2,079 people randomly assigned to eat low-fat, high-fiber diets with lots of fruits and vegetables or to follow their usual diets. In the other study, lasting three years, 1,429 participants were randomly assigned to eat high-fiber wheat bran cereals or wheat bran fiber bars, or to eat cereals or bars that looked and tasted the same but were low in fiber.
Flu researchers know the epidemic of 1918 all too well. It was the worst infectious disease epidemic ever, killing more Americans in just a few months than died in World War I, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam Wars combined. Unlike most flu strains, which kill predominantly the very old and the very young, this one -- a bird flu, as it turns out -- struck young adults in their 20's, 30's and 40's, leaving children orphaned and families without wage earners. So now, as another bird flu spreads across the globe, killing domestic fowl and some wild birds and, ominously, infecting and killing more than 100 people as well, many scientists are looking back to 1918. Did that flu pandemic get started in the same way as this one? Will today's bird flu turn into tomorrow's human pandemic? And what, if anything, does that nearly century old virus and the pandemic it caused reveal about what is happening today?
The Heart Rhythm Society is meeting with the makers of implantable defibrillators and other groups next week to discuss what to do. ''I think there will be funding from somewhere,'' Dr. Hammill said. In September, the agency proposed similar restrictions on paying for stents to open blocked carotid arteries in the neck for patients, like many elderly Americans, who are at high risk of stroke from such an obstruction, but who cannot tolerate surgery. And after a meeting yesterday of a Medicare advisory committee, which said there were large gaps in knowledge about the safety and long-term effects of weight-loss surgery for the extremely obese, Medicare officials said they were thinking of requiring a registry for that treatment as well. Medicare does not intend to force studies of everything it pays for. Instead, Dr. Tunis said, ''We plan to do this for treatments that are potentially very important to the Medicare population but for which the evidence is not yet definitive.''
In 1793, however, doctors were baffled by the illness. Dr. Rush argued that it was infectious and arose when people lived in poor sanitary conditions. In his book on the epidemic, published in 1794, he wrote: ''This discovery of the malignity -- extent -- and origin of a fever which I knew to be highly contagious as well as mortal gave me great pain. I did not hesitate to name it, the Bilious remitting Yellow Fever.'' Others who thought the disease contagious said it came to the city with 2,000 French colonists who were fleeing from Haiti, noting that they had arrived just when the outbreak began. In his book, Mr. Carey advanced the refugee hypothesis: ''In July arrived the unfortunate fugitives from Cape Franconia. And on this occasion, the liberality of Philadelphia was displayed in a most respectable point of light. Nearly 12,000 dollars were in a few days collected for their relief. Little, alas! Did many of the contributors, then in early circumstances, imagine that a few weeks would leave their wives and children dependent on public charity, as has since unfortunately happened.''
These are questions that researchers say are going to occur more often as science is rapidly making it possible to find a variety of diseases at earlier and earlier stages. Lung cancer is the nation's leading cause of cancer deaths, killing about 157,000 Americans every year, more  than colon, breast, prostate and uterine cancers combined. Lung cancer is diagnosed in about 164,000 people  each year, but the five-year survival rate is just 14 percent -- virtually the same as it was 30 years ago. The earlier that diseases are found, the less that is known about their likely course and the more difficult the questions. Molecular tests are being developed for bladder cancer and colon cancer, for example, that would look for individual genes that go awry, long before any tumors are evident. Scientists are working on scanning tests for early Alzheimer's disease and on ever more precise ways of finding very early breast cancer.
A month after the study ended, those athletes were back to their old eating habits, and their body composition and performance on the anaerobic test were back where they had been before the study. ''It was incredible,'' Dr. Benardot said. ''They went right back to their baseline levels.'' Even if the distance runners in the Beijing Olympics eat perfectly, though, they are going to face the problem of air pollution. In March, Randy Wilber, an exercise physiologist with the United States Olympic Committee, went to Beijing to measure the air quality at training and competition sites. ''I walked around the city for over a week,'' he said. The air was not good. It had high levels of carbon monoxide, which significantly decreases the amount of oxygen that blood can carry. Added to that were high levels of ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter, all of which can inflame and constrict the air passages in the lungs and set off asthma attacks even in people who have never had them.
''The heart rate is probably the least important variable in comparing athletes,'' Dr. Hagerman said. Heart rate is an indicator of heart disease, said Dr. Michael Lauer, a cardiologist and the director of clinical research in cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation. But, he added, it is not the maximum that matters: it is how quickly the heart rate falls when exercise is stopped. An average healthy person's heart rate  drops about 20 beats in a minute and the rates of athletes ''nose dive by 50 beats in a minute,'' Dr. Lauer said. In three recent studies, Dr. Lauer and his colleagues found that people whose rates fell less than 12 beats within a minute after they stopped exercising vigorously had a fourfold increased risk of dying in the next six years compared with those whose heart rates dropped by 13 or more beats. Dr. Lauer pays no attention to the standard formula when he gives treadmill tests. More than 40 percent of patients, he said, can get their heart rates to more than 100 percent of their predicted maximum. ''That tells you that that wasn't their maximum heart rate,'' Dr. Lauer said.
The larger concern about orlistat, however, is that it is not a blockbuster drug, as even its champions admit. The average weight loss it elicits is minimal. After all, said Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity expert at Rockefeller University in New York, the difference in weight lost between obese people taking orlistat and those taking a placebo was fewer than seven pounds. Dr. Heymsfield acknowledged, ''It's not a magic bullet,'' but, he said, the people taking orlistat had other benefits that might have made them healthier by reducing their risk of heart disease. Their blood pressure was about a point lower than that of the group taking placebos; their cholesterol levels averaged 201, compared with 195 in the placebo group, and their blood sugar levels were about 2 percent lower. And, Dr. Heymsfield said, even the disagreeable gastrointestinal side effects might be helpful. People who eat a fatty meal and then suffer the orlistat-induced consequences might think twice about indulging again.
Four years ago, Dr. Tanja Dominko went to a laboratory in Oregon with high hopes that she would soon be cloning monkeys. The lab was generously financed with federal grants, there were plenty of monkeys to work with and most experts thought that since Dolly the sheep had just been created by cloning, monkeys would not be far behind. She left a year ago, with a cloning portfolio that she calls her gallery of horrors. After three years, and about 300 attempts, the best she got was a placenta with no fetus. Most of the time, she saw grotesquely abnormal embryos containing cells without chromosomes, where the cell's DNA resides; or cells with three or four nuclei and one time even nine; or cells that looked more like cancer cells than the cells of a healthy animal. So Dr. Dominko joined a long line of cloning researchers unable to create clones. And the story she tells, she says, is a seldom-heard cautionary tale.
Now, three researchers have repeated the study, this time with college students. Once again, almost no one, not even fat people, liked the fat person. ''Obesity was highly stigmatized,'' wrote the researchers, Janet D. Latner of the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, Albert J. Stunkard of the University of Pennsylvania and C. Terence Wilson of Rutgers University, in the July 2005 issue of Obesity Research. One problem with blaming people for being fat, obesity researchers say, is that getting thin is not like quitting smoking. People struggle to stop smoking, but many, in the end, succeed. Obesity is different. It's not that the obese don't care. Instead, as science has shown over and over, they have limited personal control over their weight. Genes play a significant role, the science says. That is not a popular message, Dr. Brownell says. And the notion that anyone can be thin with a little effort has consequences. ''Once weight is due to a personal failing, a lot of things follow,'' he said. There's the attitude that if you are fat, you deserve to be stigmatized. Maybe it will motivate you to lose weight. The opposite happens.
The complication, he added, ''is that probability has both of these meanings simultaneously.'' ''Risk in many ways is a state of mind,'' Dr. Goodman said. And a change in the way risk estimates are presented can have a profound effect on how fearful people are, he said. That happened with the new cancer risk charts. Dr. David McNamee, an editor at The Lancet, a British medical journal, sent an e-mail message to Dr. Woloshin saying the charts ''work for me.'' ''Foolishly, I started smoking again last year after quitting for about 20 years,'' Dr. McNamee wrote. ''I can see it is time to stop again (I am 50 in November), and get back to the gym. I have put the charts on the office wall.''
''We've been caught off guard,'' said Dr. Daniel W. Jones, a blood pressure expert at the University of Mississippi Medical Center who is a spokesman on high blood pressure for the heart association. ''We don't have a system in place to ensure the accurate determination of blood pressure.'' Dr. Claude Lenfant, the director of the Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, agreed, saying, ''It is clearly a matter of public health.'' The push to get rid of mercury sphygmomanometers, as the devices are known, began in June 1998, when the Environmental Protection Agency and the American Hospital Association agreed to eliminate as much mercury waste as possible from hospitals by 2005. Others, including medical clinics and many doctors' offices, joined the effort, getting rid of such things as thermometers and batteries that contained mercury. The use of mercury devices remains legal. Environmental and medical experts say they are not a leading cause of mercury contamination, though they add that a spill from a broken sphygmomanometer can be expensive to clean up.
Training, or lack of it, in how to handle these tricky situations can make or break a scientist, Dr. Zigmond said. ''We play this game: we train students to spend all their time in the lab but we fail to disclose to them all the other facets of the job that they need to know how to handle,'' Dr. Zigmond said. ''It's probably the case that a number of people fail in their careers not because they are not bright and not because they are not ready to work hard, but because they don't have these skills.'' Dr. Macrina's class got some practice in developing those skills when they broke up into small groups to discuss a few case histories. Some considered the story of a graduate student whose prospective new boss asked him to help fulfill the lab's wish list for equipment. The university supplies new assistant professors with equipment they need to set up their lab. The lab director asked this student, whom he is about to hire, to request a few extra items that others need.
But the estrogen patch, Dr. Buckholtz added, has a different estrogen formulation, and it is not known if the patch and progestin convey the same risk as Prempro. Researchers had preliminary evidence that treatment with an estrogen patch might slow the disease and, he said, the women would be taking the drugs for only a year. On balance, he said, it was decided that the study continue. Yet, Dr. Hodes said, the Women's Health Initiative study made him question the future of hormone replacement studies, asking what evidence would be enough to justify testing other estrogen formulations, or nutritional supplements like soy or black cohosh, in healthy women. ''It's a very difficult judgment,'' he said. ''There is no easy answer.''
''What we are saying is that we think that a lot of information has been developed over the last 10 years that increases our assurance of the safety'' of silicone implants, said Dr. David Feigal of the F.D.A. in a telephone news conference yesterday. ''But there is additional information that we think is necessary for this product to pass the threshold of what we would consider necessary.'' The agency also announced yesterday that it was revising the guidelines for such devices, requiring more information and data from the makers of implants, which are designed to enlarge breasts or are used in the reconstruction of a breast after removal because of cancer. Dr. Dan Schultz of the F.D.A. said that the agency wanted better information on the long-term effects of implants. ''What we want is a picture of the device over its lifetime,'' Dr. Schultz said. But, he said, that did not necessarily mean that the agency would require that companies do clinical trials lasting a decade. ''We are open to different kinds of studies, some prospective, some looking at failed products,'' he said.
But, Dr. Hahn said, if someone decides not to eat farmed salmon, then what? ''What risk are you substituting?'' he asked. ''What else are you going to eat?'' The authors of the Science paper reached their conclusion about risk with what they characterized as the environmental agency's methods for assessing health effects of the contaminants in fish caught in sport fishing. The health risk they reported was from their assessment of the added risks of PCB's, dieldrin and toxaphene in the fish. Dr. Troxell said the F.D.A. would not do such a calculation. ''We don't consider it correct to add the risks together for the three compounds unless you have the science to show they're based on the same mechanism of action,'' he said. ''We're not aware of any science relating to that.'' Dr. Knuth, the author of the new study, acknowledged the disagreement over how to assess risk and said the environmental agency allowed adding cancer risks. ''That, of course, is a value judgment as to which you think is appropriate,'' she said.
Correction:  March 18, 2001, Sunday  Because of an editing error, an article last Sunday about the difficulty of improving the accuracy of various kinds of statistics numbers misidentified a county in California that recently spent $14 million for new voting machines. It is Riverside County, not Sequoia.
Results from animal studies further bolstered the hypothesis. Scientists deleted the cox-2 gene, preventing mice from making the enzyme. They were protected from intestinal and skin cancers. They altered the gene so that mice churned out huge quantities of the enzyme. The animals developed breast cancer when they were given cancer-inducing chemicals, whereas other mice, who also were given cancer-inducing chemicals and served as controls, did not. With the introduction, in the early 1990's, of Vioxx and Celebrex, the cox-2 inhibitors, cancer researchers saw an opportunity. They worry about aspirin's side effects, especially strokes and ulcers, but those are because of its blocking of cox-1. The new drugs may be much safer in cancer-prevention studies. ''It was a scientific opportunity to develop a new anti-inflammatory with fewer side effects and possibly greater efficacy,'' Dr. Hawk said. ''It was not only a scientific opportunity, it was also a marketing opportunity.'' The companies started by testing and marketing the drugs for arthritis. ''Doing those trials is easier and more efficient and can result in drug approvals in a shorter period of time than something like cancer prevention,'' Dr. Hawk said. But, he added, referring to the National Cancer Institute, ''the N.C.I. was interested because of the growing interest in this area and the need to get the safest compound you can that is still efficacious.''
Some say that the linear model is the best way to estimate radiation risk, but others say that there is, in fact, a threshold below which radiation poses no hazard to health. And still others say that low doses of radiation are actually beneficial. The linear hypothesis had its origin in 1927, when the geneticist Dr. H. J. Muller published a paper on his work eliciting gene mutations in fruit flies by bombarding them with radiation from X-rays. In a paper published in the journal Science, Dr. Muller showed that the number of mutations in fruit flies was proportional to the dose of X-rays that had struck the insects. ''He said: 'Aha! There's a linear relationship,' '' said Dr. Dade W. Moeller, a radiation expert and professor emeritus at Harvard who runs a consulting company, Dade Moeller &amp; Associates in New Bern, N.C. Yet, Dr. Moeller points out, those studies by Dr. Muller used very high doses of radiation, and he elicited gene mutations, not cancer. But the idea that radiation's effects were directly proportional to its dose caught hold and soon was being used to predict cancer cases. The difficulty was in demonstrating it.
A company that deciphered the human genome has just submitted a paper for publication. But, in a highly unusual move, the company will not be adhering to the customary practice of simultaneously depositing its gene sequence data in a public repository freely available to all. Instead, the company, Celera Genomics, will put the data on its Web site, making them available to researchers free and to companies for a fee. The arrangement, announced by Celera and the editor of the journal Science, who said the paper would be published early next year, highlights the tricky financial issues that accompany the new era of genome research. Celera wants to sell its data. But scientific journals are committed to making all data related to its papers public. So how, Science's editors had asked, could they satisfy these conflicting goals? And did they want to set a precedent? Dr. Donald Kennedy, a Stanford University professor of environmental science who is editor of Science, said the issue arose in June when Celera and the publicly financed Human Genome Project were on the verge of announcing that they had each determined virtually the entire sequence of the genetic script that makes up a human being. Dr. Kennedy wanted to publish papers from the two groups describing this achievement.
For the new study, the National Cancer Institute asked seven research teams to explain what had occurred. The death rate was nearly flat from 1975 until 1990, when it was 49.7 per 100,000 women ages 40 to 75. In 2000, the rate dropped, to 38 per 100,000 for that age group. In the meantime, mammography for women older than 40 soared. In 1985, about 20 percent of women were estimated to have had mammograms in the prior two years. In 2000, the figure was 70 percent. At the same time, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy with tamoxifen, which blocks the effects of estrogen that can fuel breast cancer, had come on the scene, and their use had spread rapidly. To develop their estimates, the researchers built computer models of the disease, its detection and its treatment, asking whether they could explain the falling death rate from 1990 to 2000. The answer, they all agreed, was that they could explain it only if both mammograms and treatment were having an effect.
Some experts on the subject said they were betting that Dolly's telomeres would be normal. A cellular enzyme normally lengthens telomeres in embryo and fetal life, and should have lengthened Dolly's telomeres as well, they said. But Dr. Alan Colman, the research director of PPL Therapeutics, said scientists had repeatedly asked his group to check on Dolly's telomeres. ''Right from the start, when Dolly's birth was announced, people said, 'Have you looked at the telomeres yet?' '' Dr. Colman reported. Dr. Shiels and his colleagues compared Dolly's telomeres to those taken from cells of 18 other sheep and to those from a sheep cloned from an embryo cell and one cloned from the cell of a fetus. Dolly's telomeres were about 20 percent shorter than those of the sheep that were not clones, the scientists said. The sheep cloned from an embryo cell also had slightly shorter telomeres, but the stunting was less than with Dolly, they said, adding that the sheep cloned from a fetal cell did not have shortened telomeres.
Johns Hopkins University said today that it accepted full responsibility for the recent death of a volunteer in an experiment. In a report on its investigation into the death, the university said the researcher who conducted the experiment and the ethics committee that approved it had failed to take adequate precautions to protect research subjects. ''Regardless of the fact that we are unlikely ever to know precisely how or why this happened, Hopkins takes full responsibility for what did happen,'' said Dr. Edward B. Miller, the dean and chief executive of Johns Hopkins Medicine. The volunteer, Ellen Roche, died from lung failure on June 2. Ms. Roche, a 24-year-old technician at the university's asthma and allergy center, had been ill since May 5, one day after she inhaled an experimental compound as part of a study to understand the cause of asthma. Ms. Roche spent several weeks in an intensive care unit as teams of doctors tried to halt the unrelenting failure of her lungs. Her air sacs collapsed, her lungs became stiff, air began to leak out of them, her organs began to fail, and, finally, her family decided to remove her life supports.
(That is true, Colonel Holcomb said, but he added that after the first firefight, medics would realize how important Ringer's was. ''They go back and pick it up,'' he said.) In Iraq, the Army is testing alternatives, like Hextend, a fluid that does not to be refrigerated and stays in the blood vessels, unlike Ringer's, which seeps out. It appears that a half-liter of Hextend may be the equivalent of three liters of Ringer's. But that equivalence, Dr. Holcomb said, needs to be tested in a large clinical trial, one of the many studies he and others are planning among civilians, who would be given the fluids in ambulances. Dr. Donald Jenkins, chief of trauma at the Air Force's Wilford Hall Medical Center in San Antonio, said that the next step might be even more impressive. What if the fluid in the medic's backpack is more than just a salt solution? What if it is more like blood itself, able to provide oxygen to tissues?
And while Dr. Seals is now proposing a new formula to use as a general guide, he and others say it is simplistic to rely on a single formula to predict the maximum heart rates of individuals. The common formula was devised in 1970 by Dr. William Haskell, then a young physician in the federal Public Health Service and his mentor, Dr. Samuel Fox, who led the service's program on heart disease. They were trying to determine how strenuously heart disease patients could exercise. In preparation for a medical meeting , Dr. Haskell culled data from about 10 published studies in which people of different ages had been tested to find their maximum heart rates. The subjects were never meant to be a representative sample of the population, said Dr. Haskell, who is now a professor of medicine at Stanford. Most were under 55 and some were smokers or had heart disease.
The control group of women had far fewer birth defects than usual, Dr. Erickson said, one baby rather than the expected four to six, which made the comparison even more dramatic. Dr. Khattak said not every chemical that causes birth defects causes only one specific kind of defect and that the women were exposed to a wide variety of chemicals, which could account for the diverse group of birth defects in their babies. He added that the extraordinarily high numbers of birth defects in the group that was exposed to the chemicals could not be dismissed. But Dr. Mitchell said, ''Think of all the women of childbearing age who will be scared to death.''
''Most of it involves transfers from the young to the old,'' he said. ''Down the road, most medical care will be for people over age 65, and most of the payments will be from taxes on younger people.'' Dr. Fuchs calls it the restaurant check problem. ''You go out to a restaurant with a bunch of friends and you sort of understand that you will split the check,'' he said. ''The waiter comes along and says, 'The lobster looks very good, and how about a souffl√© for dessert?' The restaurant check balloons, but you are not so careful because you figure everyone is splitting it. ''That's the way medical care gets paid for,'' he said. Dr. Fuchs added, "We want to spend our money on the things that will bring the most value for the dollar. When we are spending collective money as we are in health care, then it becomes much more difficult.''
Responding to growing doubts about the safety and value of hormone replacement therapy in women after menopause, two federal agencies are reviewing what is known about the drugs and what women and their doctors should be told about them. The National Institutes of Health said this week that it would hold a public meeting on Oct. 23 and 24 in Bethesda, Md., to discuss questions about the therapy. The Food and Drug Administration is reviewing the labeling of hormones. The goal of the October meeting, said Dr. Vivian Pinn, director of the institutes' Office of Women's Health, is to address confusion in the wake of a federal study last month that found increased health risks from one hormone combination taken by millions of women. Dr. Pinn said participants would also discuss whether recent findings from that study, the Women's Health Initiative, could be generalized to similar products. Researchers, doctors and the public will be invited, she said, along with representatives from drug companies, professional groups and federal agencies.
One is to open arteries with a clot-dissolving drug like tPA, for tissue plasminogen activator. ''These have been breakthrough therapies,'' said Dr. Joseph P. Ornato, a cardiologist and emergency medicine specialist who is medical director for the City of Richmond, Va. ''But the hooker is that even the best of the clot buster drugs typically only open up 60 to 70 percent of blocked arteries -- nowhere close to 100 percent.'' The drugs also make patients vulnerable to bleeding, Dr. Ornato said. One in 200 patients bleeds into the brain, having a stroke from the treatment meant to save the heart. The other way is with angioplasty, the procedure Mr. Orr got. Cardiologists say it is the preferred method under ideal circumstances. Stents have recently been questioned for those who are just having symptoms like shortness of breath. In those cases, drugs often work as well as stents. But during a heart attack or in the early hours afterward, stents are the best way to open arteries and prevent damage. That, though, requires a cardiac catheterization laboratory, practiced doctors and staff on call 24 hours a day. The result is that few get this treatment.
The finding reminded scientists of data from the HERS study, which looked for heart attacks in women who already had heart disease. There, too, the women taking estrogen initially had more heart attacks. But later the incidence of heart attacks declined, so that in the end estrogen had no effect on heart attack incidence. Dr. Deborah Grady, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California at San Francisco, said the preliminary results from the Women's Health Initiative made it statistically unlikely that hormone replacement therapy would turn out to prevent heart disease. ''It's very unlikely in my mind that they will ever be able to show an overall benefit,'' she said. Nonetheless, a study being published today alongside Dr. Herrington's on artery narrowing attributed a reduction in heart disease among women in part to hormone replacement therapy. While it was not a randomized trial -- that is, the women chose to take estrogen or not to take it -- it was huge: Dr. Walter C. Willett of the Harvard School of Public Health and his colleagues followed 85,941 female nurses for 14 years.
Other tests, like neurologists' assessments of the patients while they were taking their medication and the patients' assessments of their condition in diaries they kept also showed no effect of the surgery. And there was no difference between the two groups in the doses of drugs needed to control the disease. The one glimmer of hope came from assessments by neurologists before the patients had had their first dose of medication in the morning. By that measure, the 10 patients under age 60 who had had the fetal cell implants seemed better than those who had had sham surgery, with less rigidity, although their tremor was just as bad. Dr. Freed hailed that result, saying, ''It was a clear-cut improvement.'' And, he added, the fetal cells survived in most patients' brains. ''I would be disappointed if people used a strict clinical trial approach,'' Dr. Freed said. ''This study is about multiple phenomena.''
It is a discipline born, in large part, from a federal mandate. In 1989, the National Institutes of Health began requiring that graduate students supported by its grants have training in the responsible conduct of research. No money was provided for such training, and none is provided now, and many schools took care of it with half-day seminars or Web sites. But more and more, universities are instituting real courses, like the one Dr. Macrina teaches, and requiring students to take them. There are no national data on the number of courses being offered, but scientists, like Dr. Zigmond, who teaches a seminar on how to teach them, and Dr. Macrina and Dr. Kalichman, who advise universities that are setting up courses, say their services are increasingly in demand. At the same time, scientists have become more contentious about ethics issues, like who has the right to be an author on a paper. Not long ago, journals almost never heard from angry scientists in such disputes, Dr. Macrina said. But now, he said, editors tell him such arguments are regular occurrences, and his own experience as a recent editor of The Journal of the American Society for Microbiology confirms the problem.
Anita Vazzano, who turned 75 on Aug. 9, says she just does not give old age much of a thought. A widow who lives alone, she still works, taking a bus each day from her home in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, to her office in Manhattan. She knows many people become weak and frail when they grow old, but that is not her, she says. ''It has to happen someday, but that day is so far off,'' Mrs. Vazzano says. She knows the stereotypes. She has seen the offensive greeting cards. And she hates them. ''If I was old,'' she says, then catches herself and laughs. In her view, she adds, old age, ''is not going to happen for a long time.'' The New Age This is the third article in a series looking at the science of aging. Other articles will explore who ages well and why. The articles will remain online at nytimes.com/aging.
But even a hint of risk should swing scientists' reasoning, some said. Dr. John Erdman, a professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, said doctors and scientists themselves were taking high doses of vitamin E. ''I remember going to meetings where they said, 'Raise your hands if you're taking vitamin E.' An awful lot of people raised their hands.'' Now, he said, ''The increase in risk is extremely small, but it appears to be real.'' Dr. Benjamin Caballero, the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the study showed the problem with assuming that vitamins at least would do no harm. ''This reaffirms what many have already said,'' Dr. Caballero said. ''The evidence for supplementing with any vitamin, and particularly vitamin E, is just not there. This idea that people have that even if it does not have any effect, at least it will not hurt, may not be that simple.''
Susan Burke, vice president of nutrition services at eDiets, says the program has changed since 2001, when that study was done. ''It's more personalized and flexible,'' she says, and clients who use the support programs and diet lose weight. Programs like Take Off Pounds Sensibly (TOPS) and Overeaters Anonymous are free or charge only nominal fees, but it is not clear how participants fare. Carol Trinastic, a spokeswoman for TOPS, said the organization collected data on weight loss. The most recent, from 2003, indicate that members lost 1,271,466 pounds or 5.9 pounds per person. But the modest and temporary weight losses with diet programs are not a surprise, Dr. Wadden said, because no one knows how to elicit permanent weight loss. ''I don't blame the diet programs. They're fighting biology,'' Dr. Wadden said. ''Even in the best of circumstances, people will regain a third of what they lost in one year and two-thirds in two years and they may be back to base line in five years.''
Dr. Colman said the critics had a point. ''At the end of the day, that's a criticism that has probably got some justification to it,'' he said. Dr. Harry Griffin, assistant director of the Roslin Institute, noted that the report was a letter, not a full scientific paper. ''You have to appreciate that the measurement of telomere length is not an exact science,'' Dr. Griffin said.
But what is it that tempts people to eat so much? Hypotheses abound. ''Portion sizes are enormous,'' said Dr. F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, a professor of medicine at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital. ''People are walking around with liter cups of milkshakes. And people nibble all the time. They're eating on the street, they're eating all night while they watch television.'' Americans are eating more and more meals away from home, too. Fast foods are notoriously fattening. But expensive restaurants, too, have been known to ladle on the fat, knowing it makes their food taste good. Mashed potatoes at luxury restaurants may contain one part butter to two parts potatoes and even vegetables often get a tablespoon of butter per serving added on their way out of the kitchen. At Union Pacific, a Manhattan restaurant, the menu correctly said that its halibut was poached, but it did not say in what. The answer, said the proprietor and chef, Rocco DiSpirito, was goose fat.
Abortion Pill Dilemma Now, clinics are grappling with the mifepristone dilemma. Owners feel they have to offer the recently approved abortion pill, formerly known as RU-486, because women are asking for it and seem to expect it. But its price -- $270 for three pills -- will be a problem. Many owners say that if they charge what it costs to provide the three pills plus the three office visits, the lab work, and the counseling, they will lose customers to competitors who say they will keep the price much lower. Some have found creative solutions. Ms. Chelian said she is considering offering women just one pill instead of three and to have them sign a form saying they understand that one pill is not the approved dose but that studies have shown that one pill is effective. Then she can charge them just $80 more than for a surgical abortion.
Lawyers representing women who contend that their health has been affected by their silicone breast implants sought yesterday to dismiss the report of a panel of scientists who evaluated the issue, saying that one panel member had a conflict of interest. They said his collaboration with the other three members of the panel ''taints the final opinions'' of the group. The lawyers filed a motion yesterday in Federal District Court in Birmingham, Ala., where Judge Sam C. Pointer Jr., who oversees breast implant lawsuits in Federal courts, had appointed the panel to evaluate research on the toxicity of silicone breast implants. In their report last December, the scientists said evidence to date did not support claims that implants had caused disease. Now, plaintiffs' lawyers said, they have discovered that one of the four, Dr. Peter Tugwell of the University of Ottawa, had entered into consulting agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb, an implant maker, at about the time the panel's report was being released. They said Dr. Tugwell had received a $750 honorarium for taking part in a company-sponsored seminar on arthritis and agreed to participate in the company's research on new arthritis drugs. They also said he had solicited money for a professional meeting from drug companies, including Bristol-Myers.
''The full scale of this has emerged gradually, over a period of weeks,'' said Dr. Jonathan B. Tucker, a bioterrorism expert at the Washington office of the Monterey Institute of International Studies. Even when a letter with highly lethal spores arrived at Senator Tom Daschle's office, said Dr. Jeffrey Koplan, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ''we were still operating on the assumption that in order for a letter to convey this -- the anthrax -- it had to be either opened by someone who was opening mail, or in some way torn or disrupted in the sorting process, because the concept of powder in a sealed letter was one that suggested it would stay with that letter.'' Calvin Chue, a scientist at the Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies at Johns Hopkins University, said the idea that spores in the mail could give postal workers inhalation anthrax was not even considered. ''Most of us didn't consider how mail was processed,'' he said.
Rimonabant, said Dr. Jeffrey Friedman, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University, ''is the first in what I think will be a wave of rational therapies'' that attack what has recently been learned about how eating is controlled. But with rimonabant, he said, ''the issue is, what's the safety and efficacy?'' The company says it has enrolled more than 13,000 subjects in clinical trials asking if the drug helps with weight loss, or smoking cessation, and whether it improves cholesterol and triglyceride levels and reduces blood sugar levels. The weight loss studies are furthest along. Dr. Pi-Sunyer's study involved 3,500 people at 74 medical centers. Eighty percent were women, weighing an average of 220 pounds. A year later, as a group, they had lost an average of about 14 pounds. Half dropped out along the way. Some cited problems like nausea. Another reason, said Dr. Douglas Green, the company's vice president for regulatory affairs, is that the study subjects had expected to be thin, and they were not. ''They are looking to go from being obese to someone who can suddenly show up in a swimsuit at a beach,'' Dr. Green said. ''That's their expectation.''
Coronaviruses also have molecular targets that should make them vulnerable to attack by drugs. It may also be possible to develop a SARS vaccine because people, and animals, who are infected with coronaviruses make antibodies that at least partially prevent them from being reinfected. The challenge will be to develop a vaccine that elicits antibodies in the respiratory tract and intestines, where they are needed. Thus far, the World Health Organization has tried to stop SARS from spreading by issuing travel advisories, suggesting that people avoid going to Hong Kong, Beijing, Guangdong and Shanxi provinces in China, and Toronto. The health organization is also advising that patients and those who came into close contact with them be quarantined. But the virus has continued to spread. As of Friday, the W. H. O. said 4,649 cases and 274 deaths have been reported from 26 countries. In the United States, there are just 39 probable cases of SARS and no deaths, a situation that Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, attributed to ''good luck.''
''We didn't have someone in a lab thinking, 'Gee, if an animal swims longer, it won't be depressed,''' Dr. Ruffolo said. Instead, researchers found, by trial and error, that the same drugs that make a mouse swim longer are the ones that alleviate depression in humans. ''It almost didn't matter what the behavior was,'' Dr. Ruffolo said. Such tests, says Dr. Solomon Snyder, director of the department of neuroscience at Johns Hopkins University Medical School, are ''very, very empirical.'' But, he added, there is a certain rationale at work. ''What's notable about depressed people is that they are hopeless. That's sort of what they are trying to model.'' Some psychologists say they can make animals exhibit signs of depression by putting them in situations where they feel helpless to control their fate. ''All this stuff about animals don't feel sad or hopeless, that's some huge leap,'' said Dr. Martin Seligman, director of the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania. He said that the only sign of depression that could not be elicited in animals was suicide.
Dr. David Costill, a professor of exercise science at Ball State University here, has an unexpected conflict.  An important donor has suddenly shown up and Dr. Costill and his colleagues must spend an hour with him. But in the meantime, a reporter has also arrived, to interview Dr. Costill. So he asks the reporter how she would like to occupy herself for an hour or so. Professors at other departments might offer a cup of coffee or a stack of journal articles to read. But this is the Human Performance Laboratory, and so the suggestions are a bit different. Run? Swim? Lift weights? When she says she would like to run, several strapping graduate students quickly ask how far and describe the best routes. Clearly, this is no ordinary academic department. Those who work and study here are not just scientists, but athletes. The excessively fit graduate students all seem to be competitive swimmers or runners or bicyclists. In their spare time, they do things like rock-climbing. The Human Performance Laboratory is a male domain; for some reason, Dr. Costill says, women seldom apply.
For the first time, gene therapy has unequivocally succeeded, scientists say. Doctors used the treatment, which involves adding working genes to cells, to save the lives of several infants who might otherwise have died of a severe immune disorder. The achievement, announced yesterday in France, comes after a decade of widely heralded promise followed by dashed hopes for the revolutionary treatment. The success proves that gene therapy can work, researchers said, but the patients had a disease that is  especially suited for the treatment. The researchers cautioned that the method might not be immediately applicable to other diseases. The patients were three babies who could not grow a complete immune system. The only other treatment for the condition, a form of severe combined immune deficiency, or SCID, is a bone marrow transplant, which works just 60 percent of the time. Otherwise, patients with SCID, pronounced skid, must live in germ-free bubbles or fall prey to the  ever-present microorganisms that most people can easily fend off.
A large federal study of hormone replacement therapy in postmenopausal women was abruptly halted, researchers say, because the drugs caused a slight but significant increase in the risk of invasive breast cancer. An estimated six million women take the drugs, estrogen and progestin, to replace the hormones lost at menopause. The hope was that the drugs would not just relieve the hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness that can plague women at menopause but that over all they would also improve women's health. That, the investigators report, did not happen. The results of the study have been long awaited since it is the first and only large one to compare the effects of hormone replacement therapy with placebos in healthy women. The directors of the study, known as the Women's Health Initiative, sent letters to the study's 16,000 participants, which they should receive today, telling them to stop taking their medications.
''We can't afford to be complacent about the epidemic of obesity,'' Dr. Manson said. In fact, the new study addressed the risk only of death and not of disability or disease. There has long been conclusive evidence that as people move from overweight to obese to extremely obese, they are more and more likely to have diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels. But the investigators said it was possible that being fat was less of a health risk than it used to be. They mentioned a paper, also being published today in the journal, in which researchers including Dr. Edward W. Gregg and Dr. David F. Williamson, both of the C.D.C., report that high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels are less prevalent now than they were 30 or 40 years ago, largely because of breakthroughs in medication. As for whether there is truly a mortality risk in being underweight, Dr. Mark Mattson, a rail-thin researcher at the National Institute on Aging who is an expert on caloric restriction as a means of prolonging life, said it was not clear that eating fewer calories meant weighing so little, since some people eat very little and never get so thin. In any event, while caloric restriction may extend life, Dr. Mattson said, ''there's certainly a point where you can overdo it with caloric restriction, and we don't know what that point is.''
Researchers say elite distance runners share several inborn physiological traits, including large hearts, an efficient way of moving and an ability to keep running when they are exerting so much effort that they are panting for breath, that make them faster than most recreational runners. They also naturally avoid the sort of errors in technique that Dr. Robert Fitts, an exercise physiologist and competitive runner at Marquette University, sees in recreational athletes who run in 5- and 10-kilometer road races. For example, Dr. Fitts says, many recreational runners turn their feet out to the side rather than keeping them in a straight line. That wastes energy and slows runners down. ''Your feet should go out one in front of the other,'' Dr. Fitts explained. ''It is not very difficult to learn. I used to run along the line that is painted on a track and I would concentrate on both feet hitting that line.''
Like many other researchers, he wondered what signaled a cell to become one type or another. And he wanted to know how easy it was to redirect cells to develop into the type needed. The research is a new field  with potentially revolutionary implications, including the possibility of correcting even the most intractable health problems with cell replacements. ''The exciting thing is the idea that the adult body has cells in it that can divide and differentiate and can potentially be used for cellular replacement,'' said Dr. Fred Gage, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego. In Dr. Black's study, the investigators removed cells from the bone marrow of rats -- and of humans -- that normally would develop into tendon, cartilage, bone, muscle and fat, and grew them in the laboratory in shallow dishes. Then they added an antioxidant, beta mercaptoethanol, which, Dr. Black had discovered in his previous work, seemed to be a sort of biological double negative. It appeared to block chemicals that prevented cells from becoming nerve cells.
And advocacy groups know the power of passionate patients. Asked whether the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation would present scientists to Congress to talk about wanting to use cloned human embryonic stem cells to understand the genetic basis of diabetes or whether they would instead present a little girl with diabetes, Dr. Robert Goldstein, the foundation's chief medical officer, did not hesitate. ''Are you kidding?'' he asked. ''You always go with the little girl. There's no choice.''
''Few of these doctors in every hamlet, village and town who are supposed to make medical abortions so widely available have ultrasound equipment or the expertise to use it,'' said Dr. William West, who runs an abortion clinic in Dallas. ''They are not going to acquire such expensive equipment to enable them to do a few medical abortions that won't come close to paying for it,'' he added. The F.D.A. also requires that any doctor who provides mifepristone be able to provide a surgical abortion in case mifepristone fails or to have an agreement with another doctor or an abortion clinic that can provide a surgical abortion. Abortion clinics would be a logical choice for such backup agreements, doctors say. But clinic doctors say they have not heard from doctors who want their services. ''We have not been called by anybody about surgical backup and we are the only clinic in the Pacific Northwest that's been using mifepristone since the first trials,'' said Dr. Deborah Oyer, medical director and owner of Aurora Medical Services in Seattle. ''We have gotten lots of calls over the years about medical abortions. We have done seminars on medical abortions and we have had tons of phone calls from the lay public and potential patients. But I don't know of any doctors calling about surgical backup or about how to get started,'' Dr. Oyer said.
Other experts, like Dr. Arthur Moss of the University of Rochester Medical Center, who directed the new study, say the fears are exaggerated. Dr. Moss is continuing to follow the patients in the study, asking questions about the quality of their lives, and what he sees so far indicates that the vast majority of patients are fine. He said that just 12 of 742 patients with defibrillators in his study ended up having them turned off, and he remembers only one who had a defibrillator storm. The other 11 had fatal diseases including congestive heart failure, stroke and cancer. Dr. Leslie Saxon, the director of implanted-device services at the University of California in San Francisco, said some patients had defibrillator storms, but more often they had years of good living, free from the terror of an arrhythmia that could kill them at any moment. But rare events in a large group can still mean many people will be affected.
No one looking at her would ever guess that Eileen Barton has a food obsession. She seems so utterly normal: a part-time administrative assistant at her church, Crosspointe Church at Cary, N.C., part-time freelance writer and a conservatively dressed mother of a 12-year-old boy. She is a woman whose calm demeanor indicates a life that is balanced and in control. At a recent dinner at an Italian restaurant in Raleigh, N.C., Ms. Barton spent no time thinking out loud about what to eat. With little ado, she had a tossed salad, a glass of wine, monkfish, one slice of bread and, after her plate was cleared, one cup of decaffeinated coffee. It was almost unconscious for her to refrain from the appetizers, to abstain from the dessert, to keep her hands out of the bread basket. But eating, for Ms. Barton, is anything but impulsive. She is acutely aware of what she is eating, privately contemplating what to eat, how much to eat, and whether she has had too much to eat. She weighs herself to make sure that her weight never exceeds 145 pounds on her 5 foot 7 frame, she exercises every day, and she dreams of losing those 5 to 10 pounds that she believes would make such a difference in her appearance.
''It is still the single, most-effective treatment,'' Dr. McConnell said. But it does carry slight risks of temporary consequences, like narrowing of the urethra or bleeding. These days, only about 10 to 15 percent of men end up needing it. THE PROSTATE
Instead, without even realizing it, doctors in such areas simply see their patients twice as often, monitoring their conditions ever more closely, Dr. Wennberg said. Yet he and others say there is no evidence that patients in these regions are healthier. His colleague Dr. Fisher noted that four large studies of Medicare patients, by the Dartmouth group and three others, found no improvement in mortality in areas that spend more. Dr. John Skinner, an economist who is part of the Dartmouth research team, says the researchers focused on medical care at the end of life to control for any regional differences in the underlying health of the population -- the possibility that people in Miami might need more medical services because they are sicker than those in Minneapolis. ''People in their last six months of life tend to be pretty sick no matter where they live,'' Dr. Skinner said. ''This is what I use to effectively split the country into different quintiles of intensity and test whether the higher-intensity regions enjoy better life expectancy, since they certainly spend more over all on health care.''
Officials at the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department say they learned valuable lessons from their attempts to grapple with the mysterious illnesses -- known collectively as gulf war syndrome -- that plagued some veterans of the last gulf war. This time, they are coordinating their efforts in an effort to forestall another outbreak of symptoms or, if one does emerge, to understand it. The endeavor involves intense monitoring and measurement of the health of the troops and their exposures to microbes or potential toxins. Doctors and researchers will be able to track the medical records of troops before, during and after the war, and will have more detailed information on the location of troops during the war, what drugs and vaccines they received and when, and what substances they might have encountered in air, water and soil. ''We weren't as prepared following the last gulf war as we will be with this one,'' said Dr. Robert Roswell, the under secretary for health at the V.A.
Still, he said, he understands the appeal of dietary prescriptions. The promise of achieving better health through diet can be so alluring that even scientists and statisticians who know all about clinical trial data say they sometimes find themselves suspending disbelief when it comes to diet and disease. ''I fall for it, too,'' says Brad Efron, a Stanford statistician. ''I really don't believe in the low-fat thing, but I find myself doing it anyway.'' News Analysis
Gastroenterologists are worried about their future. The problem, as some of them see it, is that they have become so dependent on using colonoscopy to screen for cancer that many do little else. But the advent of new methods of detecting colon cancer could shove them out of the screening business. If that happens, what will gastroenterologists do? A committee of the American Gastroenterological Association says it is time to think about this possibility. It would not be the first time that the profession has had to change. A decade or so ago, gastroenterologists spent much of their time putting scopes down patients' throats and into their stomachs to look for ulcers. But over the last 20 years, for reasons that are not entirely clear, Helicobacter pylori, the bacterium that causes most ulcers, began to disappear in this country. Patients with chronic ulcers became less and less common. Asked how much chronic ulcers have diminished in incidence, Dr. Robert S. Sandler, chief of the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at the University of North Carolina, replied, ''I can't give you a statistic, but a lot.''
The icing is to constrict blood vessels before and after exercise, thereby preventing some of the inflammatory white blood cells from reaching the injured tissue. Dr. Steadman, who works with injured athletes in his clinic, does not advise trying to go back to your old exercise on your own until the pain is completely gone. Play it safe, he said, and cross-train. But others, like Dr. Fu and Dr. Kocher, are more inclined to suggest trying your old sport. Both also tell injured patients to ice before and after exercising. Dr. Kocher said he sometimes advises taking an anti-inflammatory pill, but worries about masking pain so much that patients injure themselves even more by overdoing the exercise. His rule of thumb, Dr. Kocher said, is that if the pain is no worse after exercising than it is when the person simply walks, then the exercise ''makes a lot of sense.''
Dr. Rader is leading a large study on genetic variations causing high H.D.L. that is trying to sort the question out. But for now he says, ''I really don't feel that treatment for high L.D.L. should be withheld just because the H.D.L. level is high.'' Instead, Dr. Rader puts high H.D.L. levels to the side and looks at L.D.L. and other risk factors, like a family history of heart disease. If L.D.L. levels and other risk factors tell him to treat, he prescribes L.D.L.-lowering medication. If he is undecided, he brings the high H.D.L. levels back into the picture, allowing them to push him toward or away from treatment. Dr. Bryan Brewer, chief of the molecular disease branch of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said no one should ignore high levels of L.D.L. ''If you have a high L.D.L. level you should be concerned about it, independently of your H.D.L. You are still at risk,'' he said.
Seventy percent of the nation's estimated two million emphysema patients have upper lobe damage. How will Medicare know whether a particular patient also has poor exercise capacity? Dr. Cooper says the solution is to restrict the operation to a few centers of excellence where experienced surgeons will assess patients and decide who should have the operation. Dr. Tunis agreed but said there were limits to how much policing Medicare could do, or wanted to do. ''We don't have a direct way of enforcing compliance with coverage, particularly in patient selection criteria,'' he said. ''It's sort of an honor system. But a lot of these patient characteristics are somewhat subjective or qualitative.'' And that, says Dr. Garber, is almost guaranteed to lead to overuse. There is pressure from patients, doctors and hospitals to cover expensive new procedures, even if their benefits are modest. And that is understandable, Dr. Garber said. ''If you the patient are insulated against the cost consequences of your decision, why not get the latest and greatest?'' But, he added, there is a price to be paid.
Some heart disease experts said the new studies offered persuasive evidence that doctors should focus on keeping CRP levels low in patients with severe heart disease. ''This is missing-link evidence,'' said Dr. Sidney Smith, a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina who is a past president of the American Heart Association and co-chairman of a committee of the heart association and the American College of Cardiology that sets treatment guidelines. Others, though, said CRP could instead be a marker for something else being fought by statin drugs to reduce heart disease risk. ''These are very important papers,'' said Dr. James I. Cleeman, coordinator of the National Cholesterol Education Program at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. ''They are provocative. But we need to recognize that the relationship between CRP and heart disease is a developing story. This adds to the evidence, but I'm not sure it settles the issue.''
In a telephone interview this week, Dr. Felson, a professor of medicine and a rheumatologist by training, praised the research but said it remained to be seen whether doctors and patients would abandon the procedure. ''There's a pretty good-sized industry out there that is performing this surgery,'' Dr. Felton said. ''It constitutes a good part of the livelihood of some orthopedic surgeons. That is a reality.''
''Follow-up care is not offered routinely and so if you need rehabilitation,'' she said, ''or if you become depressed after treatment or have chronic fatigue or chronic pain or cognitive problems, you wouldn't necessarily have access to resources. We don't really have guidelines for what that follow-up care should look like.'' But another way of looking at the issue, said Dr. Maurie Markman, vice president for clinical research at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, is to note the reason the discussions are even taking place. ''I grew up in an era where our goal was to cure the cancer,'' Dr. Markman said. ''It was this mind-set: Give high doses of chemotherapy. Hit them harder.'' There were just two outcomes, he said. ''You were cured of cancer or you died.'' But, he said, the mind-set has changed. He sees it in his specialty, ovarian cancer, where many women now live 5 years, 10 years or even longer after the initial diagnosis.
So is the Long Island study, which continues, a mistake, based on a false premise? ''You're not going to get me to answer that question,'' Dr. Winn said. But Dr. Michael B. Bracken, a professor of epidemiology and public health at Yale University, says the study should never have begun. ''It is an example of politicians jumping on the bandwagon and responding to the fears of their local population without really thinking through what is going on in science,'' he said. Such a study, he added, ''is not so much science as a political response.'' The study's scientists, in the meantime, find themselves trying to appease two masters, other researchers and breast cancer activists. Dr. Gammon says she meets regularly with the advocates, explaining her view as a scientist and listening to their concerns. She tells them, she said, ''that I think it's biologically plausible that there could be an environmental link to breast cancer and that we are continuing to pursue the leads that we have gotten to date.'' For example, she said, she is asking if there are genetic differences in how women respond to pollutants and, if so, whether they are related to surviving breast cancer.
That leaves researchers with another option for studying runners' highs -- rats. Dr. Virginia Grant, a psychologist at the Memorial University of Newfoundland, said rats seemed to get addicted. The evidence, she says, is that rats that are allowed to run seem unable to stop. And in studies asking if running rats behave like rats addicted to cocaine or morphine or other addictive drugs, the answer seems to be yes. Rats love running to the extent that they can actually run themselves to death. That happened in experiments in which rats, which usually nibble all day long, were offered food for only an hour a day. Animals that were left in their cages, without running wheels and without food, for the other 23 hours did fine; they quickly learned to eat all their day's calories in one hourlong session. But those that had running wheels for those 23 hours ran so much that they could not eat enough to compensate, actually eating less and less as they ran more and more, reaching distances of 12 miles by running nonstop. In a week or two, nearly all were dead of starvation.
The belief that estrogen protects the heart did not come out of nowhere. Studies comparing heart attack rates in women taking hormone replacement therapy with those who did not found lower rates of heart disease in women taking the hormones. The difficulty, though, is that women who take hormones tend to have a lower risk of heart disease anyway. They are unlikely to smoke, more likely to exercise and they eat healthful diets. Still, the findings seemed to offer a solid reason for healthy women to take a drug for the rest of their lives. For some, though, the real appeal of estrogen may have been their hopes that it was a path to eternal youth. Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the maker of Premarin, the best-selling estrogen product, says that while 10 million American women take the drug, it is only approved for the treatment of symptoms of menopause, like hot flashes, and for the prevention and management of osteoporosis, the bone disease many women suffer after menopause. But Lauren Hutton, a supermodel who is featured in company advertisements about menopause, told Parade magazine that estrogen was ''good for your moods, it's good for your skin.''
''Just because something works in one type of surgery doesn't mean it works in another,'' he said. ''Different surgeries have different risks for bleeding and different risks for having blood clots.'' Dr. Nuttall did look at the aprotinin literature, he said, and suspects that other doctors who studied the drug did so, too. But it was not always obvious from the study results, he said, that aprotinin was beneficial. Finally, there is one more problem with duplicative science. It's about credit. Who gets it? Dr. Stigler notes that renowned scientists have often been credited with results achieved first by others. This goes back to Pythagoras, he said, and includes august figures like Fourier and Laplace, as well as household names among mathematicians, like Cauchy and Chebyshev. Of course, it can be embarrassing to learn that your discovery isn't one. But the best defense may be a good offense. For example, there is the oft-told story about Larry Shepp, a famous mathematician at Rutgers University. Dr. Shepp, when told that a piece of work he thought was his discovery actually duplicated another mathematician's breakthrough, replied: ''Yes, but when I discovered it, it stayed discovered.''
But in a recent telephone interview, he said: ''I have had a bit of concern in the last several days. There seems to be an increased drowsiness, a lengthening of her periods of sleep. There is a withdrawal from this engaged person she had become.'' ''But this is an up and down process,'' he noted. ''I decided we should back off a bit, so I backed down to half a pill twice a day rather than a whole pill. And I will call the doctor.''
''Very few people believed it,'' said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer researcher at Johns Hopkins. Over the next two decades, however, evidence began mounting that the effect might be real. An Australian study found that people who happened to be taking aspirin regularly had a 40 percent reduction in their colon cancer risk. An American Cancer Society study that followed 630,000 people found that those who happened to take aspirin regularly had a 40 percent lower rate of dying from colon cancer. The studies accumulated, and now there are more than 30, with nearly all finding the same effect. In the meantime, other studies found that people who happened to take aspirin or drugs like it had lower rates of other cancers. Dr. Randall Harris of Ohio State showed that women who took aspirin or ibuprofen for at least five years had a 40 percent lower risk of breast cancer. He did other studies showing the effect again and again. But, Dr. Harris said, there was no protection if women took acetaminophen, an analgesic that acts differently from aspirin.
Now, as more and more men, and some women, are seeking large, chiseled bodies, more are learning the bitter secret of that look: It almost always takes some chemical assistance, from drugs that are often are illegal but are readily available. Use of steroid drugs has spread over the years from weight lifters to bodybuilders to elite athletes to high school and college athletes and to groups, like gay men and gym aficionados, who simply want to improve their appearance. Recently, three high school boys in a prosperous community in Utah were charged with smuggling the drugs from Mexico, planning to sell them to classmates. Steroid use is hard to quantify -- federal surveys of adults' drug use do not ask about it. There is a huge underground market for anabolic steroids, including ones approved only for horses, and steady traffic by Americans to Mexico, where, as in many other countries, they are sold over the counter. Some people get prescriptions from doctors who overlook the fact that the only legal use of testosterone in the United States is to treat a real medical deficiency. Added to that is an enormous market in nutritional supplements, which are very loosely regulated and whose makers say they have the same effects as testosterone.
''The whole issue of diagnosis is based on visual criteria,'' said Dr. Evan R. Farmer, a dermatologist, skin pathologist and the dean of Eastern Virginia Medical School. ''But with cancer, you are talking about what happens biologically. If it metastasizes and kills the patient, then you know it's cancer. If it doesn't metastasize, then you don't know if it is or isn't cancer. ''Maybe you didn't wait long enough or maybe you treated it successfully or maybe it had the capacity to metastasize but you removed it or maybe it looked like cancer and you called it cancer. But in fact it didn't have the ability to metastasize.'' Medical experts say they are agonizing over the screening questions. ''This is both an intellectual and an emotional debate,'' said Dr. Isra Levy, a cancer specialist at the Canadian Medical Association, who participated in the study of neuroblastoma screening. ''The issues are all legitimate issues, and they are very, very difficult. We are dealing in a world where certainty is desirable, but it isn't there.''
Surgery can result in incontinence and impotence. Dr. Barry noted, however, that there were ''widely varying reports'' on how often such consequences occurred. Younger men are less likely to have these effects. On average, Dr. Barry said, about 20 percent of surgery patients have at least some incontinence, requiring them to use pads. One-quarter to three-quarters of men who are operated on suffer from impotence, Dr. Albertsen said. Many claims from various medical groups that their patients have little trouble with erections neglect to mention that the men take Viagra, he added. ''I have a couple of patients -- I'm sure everyone has a couple -- who function quite well without Viagra, but more than half need it.'' Men who choose external beam radiation do not need to be hospitalized, but they come to the hospital for treatments five days a week for eight weeks. They lie on a table, with a lead shield protecting their rectum and bladder, and are treated with a beam of radiation that destroys the prostate and the tumor within. The radiation sometimes damages the bowel, leading to diarrhea and a mucus discharge that usually goes away in a few months, but in about 5 to 8 percent of patients, it lasts a lifetime. The radiation can also injure the bladder, leading to chronic urgency, a feeling that you need to urinate. Impotence, when it occurs, develops over two to three years. About 40 percent of men who have such radiation become impotent.
The result is predictable, Dr. Martin said. With less blood going to the muscles, the runner slows down or stops. The challenge, then, is to find the fastest pace that can be maintained for 26 miles. Go too fast and you may collapse before the race is over. Go a little slower than you have to and you may lose the race. ''You're on the horns of a dilemma,'' Dr. Martin said. Of course, he added, runners should not use lotions, including sunblock, because they add a barrier to the evaporation of sweat. He said that while it seemed logical to drink as much water as possible before the race -- and runners try it -- ''it doesn't work.'' The reason, he explained, is that drinking a lot of water increases blood volume and the body responds by getting rid of it, in urine. ''What you need to do is to increase your total body fluids another way,'' Dr. Martin said.
New studies in mice suggest that the hormone leptin can fundamentally change the brain's circuitry in areas that control appetite. Leptin acts during a critical period early in life, possibly influencing how much animals eat as adults. And later in life, responding to how much fat is on an animal's body, it can again alter brain circuitry that controls how much is eaten. Researchers say the findings, published today in the journal Science, are a surprise and add new clues to why weight control is so difficult in some humans. Scientists knew that leptin is released by fat cells and tells the brain how much fat is on the body. They knew that animals lacking leptin become incredibly obese, as do a few humans who because of genetic mutations did not make the hormone. Leptin injections immediately made animals, and the patients with leptin deficiencies, lose their appetites. Their weight returned to normal.
''These adenomas are very common: if you do autopsies on older adults, perhaps half would have them,'' Dr. Baron said. ''It is widely thought that to traverse the whole cancer pathway, from adenoma to cancer, takes 15 or 20 years or more. Certainly during the lifetime of a person, a few percent or less of adenomas go on to cancer.'' The advantage of preventing polyps, he added, is that doctors can occasionally miss them in screening tests, so preventing them helps cut the risk that a benign growth will escape detection and turn deadly. In addition, with fewer polyps, patients can be spared removal, which on rare occasions can cause bleeding. The studies were undertaken after a growing body of evidence strongly suggested that aspirin might impede the growth of colon and rectal cancer. The story dates from the late 1970's, when Dr. William R. Waddell of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center noticed by chance that when he gave a similar drug, sulindac, to a handful of patients with an inherited disorder that leads to hundreds of polyps, their polyps mostly disappeared.
''It was just meant to indicate the emergence of a problem,'' Dr. Melton said of the definition. ''It didn't have any particular diagnostic or therapeutic significance. It was just meant to show a huge group who looked like they might be at risk.'' But that is not how it has been interpreted, said Dr. Steven R. Cummings, of the University of California in San Francisco. ''There is no basis, no biological, social, economic or treatment basis, no basis whatsoever, for using minus one.'' Dr. Cummings said. ''As a consequence, though, more than half of the population is told arbitrarily that they have a condition they need to worry about.'' One problem is that bone density fails to capture a poorly understood factor known as bone quality, which declines with age, researchers say. ''A 50-year-old woman with a bone density that is clearly in the osteoporotic range has a much lower risk of having a fracture in the next year or the next five years than an 80-year-old woman with the same bone density,'' Dr. McGowan said. ''It's definitely something about the quality of the bone changing.''
''It's a pre-heart attack,'' Dr. Sopko said. A blood vessel is on its way to being completely blocked. ''You need to call 911.'' But most people -- often hoping it is not a heart attack, wondering if their symptoms will fade, not wanting to be alarmist -- hesitate far too long before calling for help. ''The single biggest delay is from the onset of symptoms and calling 911,'' said Dr. Bernard Gersh, a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic. ''The average time is 111 minutes, and it hasn't changed in 10 years.'' 'Time Is Muscle' At least half of all patients never call an ambulance. Instead, in the throes of a heart attack, they drive themselves to the emergency room or are driven there by a friend or family member. Or they take a taxi. Or they walk. Patients often say they were embarrassed by the thought of an ambulance arriving at their door.
Soon, even insurance for Bendectin became an issue, Mr. Woodside said. ''Before they finally pulled it off the market, the insurance was going to cost them more per year than the amount they sold -- not the profit but the amount they sold,'' he recalled. The litigation eventually made legal history. Lawyers representing women who said the drug had damaged their children brought experts into court who, critics said, were not qualified to comment and were propounding what critics called junk science. In 1993, the Supreme Court ruled on the matter, concluding that judges are to act as gatekeepers and ensure that ''any and all scientific testimony or evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable.'' The result, some legal experts say, is that if Duchesnay does bring Bendectin back, it may be the drug maker least likely to be sued. Many judges have made it clear that they will no longer allow Bendectin cases in their courts.
That will not happen this time. ''People will come back with symptoms, of course, and they will believe they are related to the gulf,'' said Anthony J. Principi, secretary of veterans affairs. ''But I believe we will be able to find answers: Was it the vaccine? Was it low levels of exposure to chemical or biological agents?'' (He added that it would be immediately clear if troops were exposed to high levels of chemical or biological agents because they would get sick.) Finding the answers to those questions was the goal repeatedly stressed by expert committees that investigated the illnesses reported by veterans of the previous gulf war. ''One of our recommendations from the first report was that the military collect the data that might be useful'' in investigating the illnesses, said Dr. John C. Bailar III, who was chairman of an Institute of Medicine committee that published its report in 1996. ''Even if the ultimate result is to rule out any exposure, that is worth noting.''
''I totally understand how one would grasp for anything that looks promising,'' Dr. Mucke said. ''But when it comes to drugs, we really have to make sure we do no harm and that we follow the guidelines that have been established.'' He worries in particular about the precedent that is being established. ''Everyone who believes that something should be on the market will be importing it,'' he said. ''We can't allow that to happen.'' Others, like Dr. John Morris, director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at Washington University in St. Louis, have told families how to get the drug. ''Alzheimer's families are desperate for anything,'' Dr. Morris said. ''I think it is justified to seek it out. It may not help, but I am willing to gamble that it may not hurt. Despite that, I don't prescribe it. I am pretty conservative and I am still holding out until the drug is approved by the F.D.A.''
''I never dreamed I would have cancer,'' Mr. Ulman said. ''But what I realized is that there was very little support out there for people who were really thinking longer term about their lives. Not, Will I live or die? But, How well will I live?'' The questions are daunting, researchers and patients say. For example, one thing that is needed is better information on how to follow patients after their initial treatment. Should they have screening tests? Which tests? How often? Those questions are mostly unanswered except for breast cancer patients, where studies found that annual mammograms and physical examinations are adequate, Dr. Rowland said. Although women may get periodic blood tests for tumor proteins, chest X-rays and bone scans, ''women who do the full nine yards don't do any better,'' Dr. Rowland said. ''It turns out that less is more,'' she said. Another need is for follow-up care, Dr. Rowland said.
Over the past few years, hundreds of clinics have sprung up, providing human growth hormone to thousands of elderly people looking for a fountain of youth. Athletes, would-be athletes and bodybuilders also take it, often in huge amounts, hoping to build muscle. But there has been almost no objective evidence on whether it works. Now, in one of the largest and most careful studies so far of human growth hormone in healthy older people, researchers find that it can markedly transform older people's bodies. The effects were potent. Those who took the drug gained lean body mass, much of which is likely to be muscle, and lost fat as if they had been working out in a gym, lifting weights and doing aerobic exercise. Some men gained 10 pounds of lean body mass and lost an equivalent amount of fat. Yet the subjects, who ranged in age from their mid-60's to their late 80's, were sedentary and did not exercise or change their diets.
Dolly was the first mammal to be cloned from cells of an adult. She was created by cloning the stored and frozen udder cells of a sheep that had been dead for years. As a clone, she is the identical twin of that long-dead, unknown and unnamed sheep. Until Dolly, many had thought such a feat was biologically impossible. Her birth ''shattered theory in science,'' said Dr. Randall Prather, a cloning expert at the University of Missouri. It is not clear how long Dolly might have been expected to live because the natural life spans of sheep have not been well studied. ''Nine months and then we eat them,'' Dr. Wilmut said. He added that while it is possible for pastured sheep to live for 11 or 12 years, those who live indoors, as Dolly had, are prone to develop lung infections. Dolly was kept inside for security reasons. Dr. Wilmut said those who had watched Dolly grow were sad.
Many doctors worry that they may be liable if infection does occur, and they fear for the safety of those who handle the sperm. Many also fear that healthy patients will avoid clinics that treat infected patients, out of concern that their embryos could be contaminated by H.I.V. The issue has created rifts in clinics: some workers have said they will refuse to take part in providing services to people with the virus. And it has led many infected patients, and some of the clinics eager to help them, to keep their identities private. But in the competitive world of fertility centers, at least one clinic, at Columbia University, sees providing treatment to men with H.I.V. as a way of helping unserved patients while gaining a market niche. It was at Columbia that Ms. Morrison and Mr. Corser eventually found help. The clinic's director, Dr. Mark Sauer, said he knew he was taking risks. But he decided a few years ago that he could greatly reduce the chances of transmitting the virus by using a technique called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, injecting a single sperm into an egg.
Scientists knew that hormones could fuel the growth of estrogen-positive tumors, which carry receptors for estrogen on their cell surfaces. The hypothesis is that when women stopped taking menopausal hormones, tiny cancers already in their breasts were deprived of estrogen and stopped growing, never reaching a stage where they could have been seen on mammograms. Other cancers may have regressed, making them undetectable. And, possibly, without hormones, cancers that would have gotten started may never have grown at all. ''This could well be the study of the year in cancer,'' said Dr. Otis Brawley, director of the Georgia Cancer Center at Emory University. He added that it also might help explain why breast cancer rates were lower for black women than for white women -- blacks, he said, were less likely to use hormones for menopause. Dr. Brawley also said the findings might explain why cancer in black women was more lethal. Hormone-initiated cancers, he said, might be less deadly than those that arise on their own.
The effort is important, Dr. Hoover said. While most scientists think that only a tiny fraction of cancers might be caused by low levels of environmental poisons, these are cancers that could, in theory, be avoided. ''All it takes is the political will to ban them or impose regulations to minimize exposure, and the cancers are gone,'' Dr. Hoover said. The problem is to decide which chemicals might be causing cancer, and in whom. Some scientists, like Aaron Blair, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute, see hints that environmental pollutants like pesticides, diesel exhaust in cities and workplaces and small particles in the air may instigate cancer. But, Dr. Blair says, there is a huge problem in following up on these hints because scientists need to figure out who was exposed to what and when the exposure occurred. Asking people is not much help. Most people do not know what they were exposed to, and even if they think they know, they often are wrong, he said.
For example, scientists recently reported that a SNP pattern in a cholesterol-metabolizing gene determined who would respond to the cholesterol lowering drug pravastatin. But the people who respond to pravastatin are also the ones who will have the worst prognosis if they do not get their cholesterol levels down. Insurers might use that genetic information to deny or limit coverage. ''You won't be able to separate the reason you did the test from the response to it,'' Dr. Collins said. The solution, he added, is to pass effective laws to prevent genetic discrimination. And, he said, ''We are pretty close to seeing that come to pass.'' Although genetics always gives rise to ethical concerns, the debate over pharmacogenetics has so far been muted, with even some longtime critics of genetic testing saying that they think it will be a blessing to doctors and patients. ''I'm all for the research,'' said Dr. Michael Kaback, a geneticist at the University of California in San Diego, who has often criticized genetic testing. ''I think it's great.''
And as soon as the Food and Drug Administration announced its approval of mifepristone in September, abortion rights advocates reported great excitement. Danco Laboratories said it had received hundreds of requests for order forms for the drug. Groups like the National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood advertised their training sessions for doctors on how to use it. And abortion clinics and abortion rights advocates like Planned Parenthood say they have been swamped with calls from women asking about the pill. But Heather O'Neill, a Danco spokeswoman, said most of the orders seemed to be from Planned Parenthood or independent abortion clinics. That is also the affiliation of most of the doctors attending National Abortion Federation and Planned Parenthood workshops, said Stephanie Mueller, a spokeswoman for the federation. And many of the women calling seem to be confused about what the pill does, thinking that they can swallow it at any stage of pregnancy and that their pregnancy will magically disappear.
Some drugs are worse than that. People with conditions like high blood pressure, for example, often find themselves trying one drug after another before they find a medication that works for them. Other drugs are rarely used because they cause side effects in a small proportion of patients. For example, a drug like Glaxo Wellcome's Lamictal, which is used to treat epilepsy, can cause itching and rashes. It can only be used by patients whose doctors are willing to start with a small dose and gradually increase it over a period of months, watching to see if a rash develops. ''When most general practitioners see that a drug needs dose escalation, they use something else,'' said Dr. Allen Roses, a neurologist who is vice president worldwide and director of genetics at Glaxo Wellcome P.L.C. ''But it's a great drug.'' Dr. Roses and others emphasize that if genetic variants could be used to identify who would respond to a drug and who would have side effects, the benefits for companies and patients would be obvious. Companies could sell more drugs, more efficiently, by marketing them to those who would be helped. And patients would get drugs that worked for them.
Dr. Foster at the University of Pennsylvania said the statistics are disheartening. About a third of his patients, for example, regained their weight within a year of losing it. About two-thirds regained it within three years. And 80 to 90 percent regained it in five years. Regardless, obesity experts say, efforts like the Washington Business Group's should not be discouraged. The group, for example, wants workplace cafeterias to offer low-calorie choices and to post nutrient levels and calorie counts for its foods. It wants stairways to be made more inviting so people will walk up a couple of flights rather than taking an elevator. ''We want to make the workplace itself supportive and empowering for those who are motivated,'' Ms. Darling said. These efforts may help, Dr. Leibel said, but without knowing exactly why people are getting fatter, it is hard to say what will make them thinner. ''When you ask what's causing the obesity epidemic, we are like deer in headlights,'' he said. ''It is clear that the environment has changed, but it is not clear exactly what aspects of the environment are responsible.''
For his patients who have received the cancer diagnosis, Dr. Albertsen said that he laid out all the alternatives, pros and cons, in an office visit. He encourages the men to bring their wife, a close friend or relative along. The response is predictable, he said. ''You confront the patient with all the information and he is overwhelmed,'' Dr. Albertsen explained. ''I usually send them off and tell them to get a second opinion or to talk to their friends.'' The English professor did just that -- he spoke to his confidant at the liquor store and learned that the store owner had chosen surgery and was now impotent. The professor was chilled. ''I think I said out loud to him, 'I don't know if I can do that,' '' he recalled. ''At that point, I had already made up my mind,'' he continued. ''I wanted the seeds. It was noninvasive, and Giuliani had had it. I figured he's going to get advice that only the mayor of New York would get.''
So Dr. Lundy sponsors seminars for doctors and hired former drug company representatives to visit them. ''I think there's a real place for doing this,'' Dr. Lundy said of the scans. ''And I think there's a population that wants to have it done. It's a question of who's going to pay for it.'' Be Well Body Scan at Beth Israel has also stayed in business, even though it sees just 25 patients a week, not nearly enough to make a profit, said Dr. Rosen, its director. ''We don't want to lose money, but we don't have stockholders; we don't have investors,'' Dr. Rosen said. When he is not using the scanner to screen patients, he said, he uses it on patients who need diagnostic radiology. Dr. Eisenberg, the man who scanned Ms. Winfrey, has a new company, Body Scan International. These days, instead of seeing patients in an office, he takes the scanner to them, operating out of a van that, on a recent day, was parked in a rundown parking lot beside a runway at John Wayne Airport in Irvine, Calif.
The safety questions involve complications, like ruptures, and whether implants can cause serious diseases. Inamed reported that in a two-year study, the rupture rate was 1.2 percent and that 7.5 percent of its 987 implants were removed or replaced. Some women had infections; others developed hard and painful scar tissue over the implant. The F.D.A. data from other studies indicated that on average, a quarter of implants had ruptured within 12 years and 55 percent had ruptured within 16 years. The big difference between this year and a decade ago, when the agency pulled silicone implants from the market, is that now there are data to address the question of whether the devices cause serious illnesses, medical experts said. ''There's just so much,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Connell, a professor emeritus of obstetrics and gynecology at Emory University. In 1991 and 1992, Dr. Connell led the drug agency's advisory committee that first considered the question of whether implants should remain on the market.
For decades, the therapy involved painful injections into muscle. A patch was introduced in the mid-1990's, but even it sometimes caused skin irritation, and some men did not like such a visible sign that they were taking testosterone. That changed in June 2000, when Unimed Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of Solvay Group, a Belgian firm, began selling Androgel, a testosterone preparation that a man could simply rub on his skin. ''It's like putting on sunblock if you're going to the beach,'' said Dr. William Crowley, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. The Food and Drug Administration approved the gel for the treatment of hypogonadism, or very low levels of testosterone, a condition that can arise from genetic disorders, chemotherapy, radiation therapy or tumors. But once a drug is on the market, doctors can prescribe it as they please. Overnight, there was a new demand for testosterone. Dr. McKinlay called it ''medicalizing normal aging.'' The analogy with menopause is false, he said, because men do not menstruate -- they ''don't have menses to pause.''
For those who do seek groups, Dr. Goodwin added, there can be real benefits. In her study, those in the groups said they felt better and had better control of their pain, trading information and advice, and giving each other concrete, practical help. Dr. Eyre said women should be encouraged to join support groups if they feel it helps them cope with their cancer. But if they do not want to join, she said, ''they should not feel forced to put their time in.'' Dr. Spiegel is not so certain that support groups do not help patients live longer. He agreed that the Canadian study was well designed and well conducted. ''It clearly provides no support for the theory that group support prolongs survival time,'' he said. But, he said, ''I don't think it is the last word.'' Others say they would be very surprised if new studies overturn the Canadian group's conclusions.
In interviews, leading arthritis specialists who have no financial ties to Merck, the maker of Vioxx, or Pharmacia, which makes Celebrex, say that they are not concerned and that they prescribe the drugs for patients who may have heart disease. But the Food and Drug Administration recently sent Merck a warning letter, telling the company that its marketing campaigns had to discuss the possibility that Vioxx might increase the risk of heart attacks. And some heart specialists say they are now telling patients that they may want to consider taking other drugs for pain. At issue is the subtle question of what counts as evidence. The new drugs, known as cox-2 inhibitors, were developed because scientists had discovered a way to make a drug that could alleviate pain and inflammation like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen, but without their tendency to cause stomach pain, bleeding or ulcers in a small percentage of people.
None of this was known to Dr. El-Rashidy. He is an expert in drug delivery systems and has been on a mission to find drugs to treat erectile dysfunction. ''I realized there may be a tremendous opportunity,'' he said. In 1987, raising about a million dollars from private investors to form his own company, Dr. El-Rashidy quit his job at Baxter International on drug delivery systems and set out to open the erectile dysfunction market. Dr. El-Rashidy's first idea was to make a cream that men could rub on the penis to get erections. But, he said, the cream failed, and so did the company. Next, Dr. El-Rashidy stumbled on apomorphine while reading scientific papers that said it gave rats erections. The problem was its effects on humans. Apomorphine, which mimics dopamine in the brain, was used in emergency rooms to induce vomiting in cases of poisoning or drug overdoses. It is also sold in Europe, at lower doses and as an injectable drug to treat Parkinson's disease.
''I agree that we need to be ready 24/7 to take care of serious problems like heart attacks. But I don't think it's the entire answer, and to say we can fix it with angiography is an oversimplification.'' Dr. Thomas H. Lee, a cardiologist and the network president for Partners Healthcare, a medical care system that includes two Harvard teaching hospitals, said the study indicated that hospitals could do better, making sure that weekend patients received the same level of care as weekday patients. ''We are pretty aggressive in this country,'' Dr. Lee said. ''Our hospital and other places have worked to make sure these services are available around the clock. But human beings are human beings, and these data really suggest that hospitals may have too high a threshold for calling in their colleagues.''
Even in states like New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Montana, that do not have laws regulating such things as the air flow in offices of  doctors who offer abortions, some doctors may shy away from the likely social controversy. Dr. James H. Armstrong, an abortion provider in Kalispell, Mont., said that he could not even tell doctors at the local hospital about how to use mifepristone. ''Every Monday we have a medical staff meeting,'' Dr. Armstrong said. ''They send out invitations and ask for suggestions for topics and suggestions for speakers.'' He suggested that he talk about mifepristone, noting that he had experience with the drug since he provided it to women as part of research studies. ''They sent me a letter saying this would cause too many problems with the medical staff,'' Dr. Armstrong said. Dr. Warren Hern, director of the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado, was not surprised.

Even if the treatment is not onerous, these people ''will go through a lifetime of being labeled with a condition they might never have gotten sick with,'' Dr. Botkin said. ''That may be a price that is acceptable if you are saving lives,'' he said, ''but not if you are not saving lives or if you don't know if you are saving lives.'' The next step will be to issue the report, which has been presented by panel members but has not been made public. Then comments will be solicited. But, said Dr. Watson, ''the public comments won't change our report,'' which he said would be published in the journal Pediatrics. The comments, he said, will be used by Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, in deciding what to recommend. Dr. Watson says uniform newborn screening is a matter of equity if nothing else. A diagnosis can be delayed until it is too late simply because the baby was born in the wrong state.
A popular technique to help infertile men become fathers, injecting individual sperm into individual eggs, alters the fertilization process, researchers have found. They said there was no evidence so far that the technique affected babies conceived with it but they said the finding raised troubling questions of what doctors should tell infertile couples. The technique, intercytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI (pronounced ICK-see), was developed about seven years ago and has been adopted by virtually every major infertility program. Tens of thousands of babies have been born through ICSI, which costs about at least $10,000 per pregnancy attempt. But in a paper published today in the journal Nature Medicine, Dr. Gerald Schatten and his colleagues at Oregon Health Sciences University in Portland, working with eggs and sperm from rhesus monkeys, report that the actual injection can damage proteins in the egg that push and pull chromosomes into line before cell division and that fertilization through ICSI skews the egg's otherwise orderly removal of proteins from sperm.
Both groups of investigators found that no matter how they analyzed the data, there was not even a hint that use of a cell phone was linked to brain tumors. The patients with brain tumors were no more likely to use cell phones. Those who used cell phones for longer periods were no more likely to get brain tumors. And brain tumors were no more likely to occur near where the cell phone was held to the head than on the opposite side of the brain. ''Based on the published evidence to date, I don't think there's any evidence that cell phones cause cancer,'' Dr. Inskip said. Dr. Mark G. Malkin, a neurologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York who was an author of the smaller study, said, ''We think this is reassuring news.'' Dr. Malkin noted that cell phones had not been in widespread use for many years and that cancers could take years to develop; thus, he said, it might be worthwhile to repeat the studies in years to come.
''Researchers and clinicians understand that this is a landmark,'' said Dr. Thomas Imperiale, a professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine, who was not involved in either study. ''These are two randomized controlled clinical trials,'' the most scrupulous form of medical research, in which people are randomly assigned to take a test drug or placebos, and their outcomes compared. ''But,'' Dr. Imperiale added, the new studies ''are on a fairly select group of people.'' The studies involved high-risk patients, for whom adenomas -- protruding growths on the inside of the rectum and colon that are commonly called polyps -- are of particular concern. Few polyps turn into cancers, but since no one knows which ones will, doctors say it is important to find them and slice them off the wall of the colon or rectum. The studies did not address the question of whether aspirin was helpful for people at average risk of colon cancer. ''These studies involved patients at greater-than-average risk,'' said Dr. Ernest Hawk, chief of gastrointestinal cancer prevention research at the National Cancer Institute. ''That changes the risk-benefit equation. We can tolerate a little risk if we have more benefits.''
Researchers have informed about 25,000 women taking part in a federal study of hormone replacement therapy that, far from protecting the heart as many researchers had assumed, the therapy may have put the women at a slightly higher risk of  heart attacks and strokes. The study, known as the Hormone Replacement Therapy trial of the Women's Health Initiative, is the first large-scale controlled clinical trial asking whether the therapy prevents heart disease in healthy post-menopausal women. But in letters sent out on Friday, participants were told that those who had been randomly assigned to take estrogen were having slightly more heart attacks, strokes and blood clots in the lungs than those who had been assigned to take dummy pills for comparison. While the effect was not sufficiently pronounced to stop the study, the researchers themselves were taken aback. The findings were reported yesterday by The Washington Post and The Los Angeles Times.
''We've known for going on 20 years that macrophages do get infected quite early,'' Dr. Martin said. ''But people have overlooked them.'' One reason is that macrophages are hard to study. ''You have to pull them out of tissue, you have to grind up tissue and then culture them under conditions that keep them happy,'' he said. ''We can't do that very well.'' The AIDS viruses in macrophages apparently do not kill the cells, and the viruses inside them are impervious to the AIDS drugs that are now on the market, Dr. Martin added. ''Once you have a macrophage infected, it might produce virus until kingdom come,'' Dr. Martin said. But Dr. Stephen O'Brien, an AIDS researcher at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Md., noted that while the virus might be in memory T-cells and macrophages and other body cells, that did not prove that these cells were the source of the virus that sprang back whenever a patient stopped taking AIDS drugs. And so, he asks, ''Where are the engines, where are the factories that are making the virus?''
''What I learned from Bill Schwab was absolutely indispensable,'' said Dr. Jenkins, who spent two years there. ''I took care of people who for sure in my training we would have looked at them and said, 'There is no way this person could survive.' '' Yet survive they did. But to bring the technique to the battlefield, the military had to make major changes. First, it had to put the surgeons with the frontline troops, so they could do damage control surgery immediately. The new idea was to keep a small surgical team on the front line, using a portable operating room that is set up in an hour for damage control surgery. From there, patients are stabilized and taken to hospitals for additional surgery days later. It required making what once was bulky equipment light and portable, said Dr. Paul K. Carlton Jr., the recently retired surgeon general of the Air Force who now directs the Integrative Center for Homeland Security at Texas A &amp; M. Today, Dr. Carlton said, surgeons can carry the equipment they need in a backpack.
Some news organizations have attributed the figure to the New York State Department of Health, but a spokeswoman for the department, Kristine A. Smith, said that the rates on Long Island were never that high and she did not know where the figure came from. Dr. Deborah Winn, head of the extramural epidemiology program at the National Cancer Institute, said: ''I don't think it is reflective of any reality. I don't know where it comes from. It's myths.'' It was fears of such an epidemic, and the political uproar that ensued, that led Congress in 1993 to authorize the nearly $30 million study that has, so far, failed to find evidence that pollutants are linked to the cancer. The breast cancer incidence in Suffolk County, in the years 1994 to 1998, was 118.2 cases per 100,000 women per year and in Nassau County it was 115.6, according to the State Health Department. The rate in the United States was 114.3 cases per 100,000 women, the National Cancer Institute said. That means that the breast cancer incidence in Suffolk County was 3.4 percent above the national average, and in Nassau County it was 1.1 percent higher than the national average.
The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute is joining with the Army to support studies in resuscitation, and it plans to set up a network of trauma research centers, said Dr. Claude Lenfant, the institute's director. It is the first time the institute has worked with the Defense Department, he said. ''Our decision is very serious; it's made,'' he added. Northfield Laboratories, a small company that has developed artificial blood, is about to start a large clinical trial in trauma centers including one at an Army center in San Antonio. Other studies are being planned, with enthusiastic military doctors urging them on. Trauma surgeons like Dr. David Hoyt of the University of California at San Diego say they see the approach of a new era. ''We hope this is going to finally represent an opportunity to do true prospective clinical trials in an organized fashion in multiple centers,'' Dr. Hoyt said. Although such studies are the norm in most of medicine, they have rarely happened in trauma because of the difficulties of obtaining consent from the patients, who are usually unconscious when treatment has to begin.
In response to the lobbying, Congress enacted Public Law 103-43 mandating the study. It was to focus on Nassau and Suffolk Counties and two other counties that had higher incidence rates than the New York State average, Tolland County in Connecticut and Schoharie County in New York. But sparsely populated Schoharie County's rate fluctuated markedly, apparently by chance. Soon after the study began it was among the lowest in the state. But the law was the law, and researchers kept studying it. Ms. Balaban said that she and other advocates were not thinking about breast cancer rates across the nation when they lobbied for the study. The data they cited, she said, showed that there was more breast caner among women living on Long Island than in the rest of the state. Dr. Gammon said that the New York State rate was 104.1 cases per 100,000 women. In Nassau County, the figure was 11.0 percent higher than New York State's, and in Suffolk County it was 13.5 percent higher.
Dr. Richard Rawlins, laboratory director at the Rush Center for Advanced Reproductive Care in Chicago, said patients there were not asked about donating embryos. In Dr. Rawlins's 17 years at Rush, he said, only one couple broached the subject. Three couples in the last three years have asked to have their embryos discarded. He is storing embryos for about 250 couples, most of whom will use them, he said. Even if scientists did want to use frozen embryos at fertility centers, there would be hurdles to overcome, Dr. Gibbons said. Each patient who has agreed to donate embryos must be contacted and agree to the particular stem cell project. Then scientists must buck the odds in getting the embryos to grow and isolating stem cells from them. Those odds can be long. Dr. Gibbons said that even if every one of the 200 embryos at the Jones Institute that might be available were used and were in the best possible condition, 50 or fewer would grow to the blastocyst stage. That is the stage, at about five or six days, when scientists can try to isolate stem cells. On average, only a small fraction of blastocysts yield stem cells.
Sometimes a problem like a herniated, or ruptured, disk causes the pain, and surgery can relieve it, said the study's author, Dr. Michael N. Brant-Zawadzki, a radiologist at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, Calif. But usually, he added, it may be more coincidence than cause and effect when an M.R.I. finds an abnormal disk in someone with back pain. And even when a herniated disk causes the pain, the problem often goes away by itself. It is easy to see the appeal of an M.R.I., said Dr. Stanley J. Bigos, an emeritus professor of orthopedic surgery and environmental health at the University of Washington. ''The reality is, patients want an answer, the doctor wants to get the patient out of the room, and the hypotheses start to flow.'' Other studies have indicated that the development of abnormal disks is usually inherited. But there were no links to occupation, sports injuries or weak muscles, said Dr. Nortin Hadler, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina.
A scientific paper that Dr. Hahn had published about the frozen chimpanzee ''was extraordinarily important,'' Dr. Holmes said. ''It really made people believe that chimps were the ancestral species.'' Dr. Paul M. Sharp, a professor of genetics at the University of Nottingham who worked on the analyses of the viruses, said: ''It had been a gradual shift in our perceptions. At first we had been saying that either chimps are the source or they are recipients, like humans.'' Dr. Hahn's chimp made all the difference, Dr. Sharp said. Now, researchers say, they have found two more chimpanzees that were infected in the wild with a virus like H.I.V.-1. The animals were among a group of 29 captured in Cameroon, in the west-central region of Africa. It would be ideal, of course, to find stored blood from the original people who contracted H.I.V.-1 and stored tissue from chimpanzees in the same area, and then show they had exactly the same virus, Dr. Holmes said. But, he added, that is not going to happen.
Another possibility is that the nurses' study and others like it miscounted hormone therapy users. The nurses' study assesses drug use every two years. A woman could start taking hormones, have a heart attack in the next two years, and stop taking them immediately. Later, when asked if she takes hormones, she says, correctly, that she does not. Her heart attack would be counted as one that occurred in a nonuser. But Dr. Grodstein added that this sort of error, by itself, was not enough to explain the discrepancy. Some suggested that it was the particular drug, Prempro, studied in the Women's Health Initiative that elicited heart attacks. The nurses took a variety of hormone preparations, not just Prempro. But Dr. Jacques Rossouw, an administrator with the Women's Health Initiative, said that several other randomized controlled trials of women who already had heart disease found that other hormone preparations also increased heart attack risk, an indiction that they may be no safer than Prempro.
''They underreported by 10 percent,'' Dr. Bray said. Many Americans also delude themselves about how much benefit they are getting from exercise, researchers say. In Dr. Serdula's national survey, about two-thirds of the people who were trying to lose weight said they were increasing their physical activity. But only 21 percent reported exercising at least 150 minutes a week, which is the minimum recommended for weight loss. The goal now, Dr. Hill said, should be to teach people what is really required to control their weights. It means showing people what the participants in his registry of successful dieters do. ''These people have figured out that they can't just leave it to chance,'' Dr. Hill said. ''They have to plan their diet and they have to plan their exercise.'' A Choice for a Lifetime Growing up, Eileen Barton had seemed like one of those girls who would never have to worry about her weight. She gave no conscious thought to what she was eating yet remained slender and healthy. In fact, she says, the first time she even thought about her weight seems silly in retrospect.
The theory predicted that a steady heartbeat would signal a heart that needed constant stimulation from the sympathetic system, and so, it predicted, a steady heartbeat would signal a damaged heart. But it did not answer some practical questions, like how do you measure heart rate variability, and how important is it in predicting risk? Dr. Lauer and his colleagues realized that the recovery rate of the heart after exercise can be a simple yardstick. He found that people with heart disease have rates that fall very slowly after exercise, less than 12 beats in a minute, as compared with healthy people, whose rates fall by an average of about 20 beats, or with elite athletes, whose rates can fall as many as 50 beats. To demonstrate that the slow decline in heart rates among people with heart disease is caused by a suppression of the parasympathetic nervous system, researchers gave athletes a drug, atropine, that temporarily blocks those nerves. ''The high-class athletes looked like the heart failure patients,'' Dr. Lauer said. ''Their heart rates did not fall at all.''
''Your whole life is a diet when you're overweight,'' said Janet B. Forton, a Pennsylvania woman who finally had weight-loss surgery last year after struggling her entire life to lose weight. ''You go to bed at night praying you make the right choices the next day.'' Why do so many people keep trying to lose weight when they so often gain it right back again? Dr. Peter Herman and Dr. Janet Polivy, psychologists at the University of Toronto, say that just the idea of dieting may give people a positive lift. ''It turns out that simply declaring you are going on a diet makes you feel better,'' Dr. Herman said. ''It seems to boost people's spirits. They feel they are empowering themselves and they are already imagining themselves as the new and better selves, taking control of their lives.'' Ms. McAfee has a different explanation. ''It is so penalized to be fat in this society that it's an investment in your future not to be fat,'' she said. ''It you're an ambitious person you'll do anything,'' and even if the lost weight is regained, ''you'll do it again and again.''
It turns out, Dr. Zigmond said, that the one question the students fail to ask is what the university's regulations say. ''Many universities have as part of their guidelines the right for any student who has a lab notebook to take a copy,'' he said. Both the student and her adviser were at fault, he added. ''She should have learned who the data belonged to,'' he said, although students almost never think to ask. And her adviser should have told her the regulations, although, he concluded, ''The truth is that most of us don't.'' Dr. Frederick Grinnell, a professor of cell biology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, says the real world of science is full of ambiguities that are seldom known to outsiders. He gives this example compiled by the Poynter Center at Indiana University that he uses in teaching: A professor agrees to review a manuscript that is under consideration for publication at a journal. He has promised to keep the paper and its contents absolutely confidential. When he reads it, however, he realizes that his student's experiments will never work; the paper shows that they are futile. Does he keep mum, or does he break the confidentiality rule and tell his student what he just learned?
In 1999, Dr. Kaplowitz and Dr. Sharon Oberfield, a pediatric endocrinologist at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, published a paper calling for revised guidelines for assessing early puberty. On the basis of Dr. Herman-Giddens's data, they said that in general, black girls starting puberty at age 6 and white girls at age 7 would be considered normal. Most textbooks said girls who were starting sexual development before age 8 required medical evaluations for precocious puberty. But Dr. Katzenellenbogen, president of the Endocrine Society, said yesterday that she and others did not consider Dr. Herman-Giddens's paper conclusive. Dr. Katzenellenbogen cited the way the study was done. For example, she said, ''all the pubertal changes were based on visual inspections -- no endocrine evaluations or hormonal measurements were done.'' In addition, she noted, ''the subjects were not randomly selected,'' a factor that might have introduced bias into the results. In response to similar criticism, Dr. Herman-Giddens has consistently defended her study.
''Most people would agree that if someone has osteoporosis, you should treat them,'' said Dr. Ethel Siris, who is a professor of clinical medicine at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and directs the Toni Stabile Osteoporosis Center at New York Presbyterian Hospital. But, she added, ''no one knows what to do about the woman who has quote unquote osteopenia.'' Dr. Joan McGowan, chief of the musculoskeletal diseases branch at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, said that, of course, drug companies see a huge market in people with low bone density, and who could blame them? Also at stake is the calcium supplement market. Many people take calcium supplements in the hope of staving off bone loss. While a large federal study is investigating their effectiveness, researchers say that calcium may have a small effect but is not going to obliterate the effects of menopause or aging.
It is no accident that there is now a proliferation of discoveries of brain chemicals that control eating, Dr. Heymsfield said. ''Most look at the discovery of leptin as the seminal event,'' he said. ''It's like a jigsaw puzzle, and suddenly there was a  puzzle to put together.'' Ultimately, scientists predict, obesity will be medically treatable. ''There's been a prejudice, a bias, that obesity is a behavioral abnormality,'' Dr. Barsh said. ''Somehow in the past, obesity was thought of as a poor relation to a real disease like heart disease or cancer.'' ''That misperception is being corrected,'' Dr. Barsh said. The Fat Epidemic The previous article in this series examined an extreme surgical treatment for weight loss. Later articles will investigate the lives of chronic dieters, overweight children, exercise and the diet business. The series will remain available online: www.nytimes.com/obesity
Gina Kolata asked two experts on opposite sides of the debate on early screening to look at breast cancer data and discuss what they indicate about screening and treatment. DR. LARRY NORTON, a breast cancer expert, president of the American Society for Clinical Oncology and the chief of medical oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, looked at the breast cancer data and said that mammography was allowing women to have less disfiguring surgery and less chemotherapy. ''Twenty five years ago, I saw big tumors,'' he said. ''Now the whole nature of the disease has changed. In general, I do not think I have seen a Stage 3 cancer in years, and I used to see them every week,'' referring to disease so advanced that the entire tumor cannot be removed. He said women should continue to have mammograms. ''I have seen nothing yet that tells us we shouldn't screen while this issue is being thought about,'' he said.
Using a new kind of vaccine, researchers report that they have been able to control a particularly lethal strain of AIDS virus in monkeys. The vaccine, made of DNA, did not prevent the animals from becoming infected, but it did prevent them from becoming ill, keeping the level of the virus so low that it was virtually undetectable in the animals' blood. But the researchers urged caution, saying that although they were elated by the results, it could be a long and difficult path from promising data in monkeys to a vaccine that worked in humans. And even in monkeys, questions remain. It is not yet known, for example, how long the vaccine's effects will last. ''The major point that I see in this work is the concept,'' said Dr. Norman L. Letvin, who directed the work and is a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. ''It might be possible with a vaccine to perhaps change the clinical course of an infection without blocking an infection.''
A similar problem recently emerged with breast self-examination, another method of early detection that had been highly promoted. When studies in China and Russia indicated that it did not prevent breast cancer deaths, the cancer institute quietly dropped its emphasis on the method, saying in a database primarily for doctors that there was insufficient evidence of its value. The institute will ask a panel of independent experts that advises it on that same database to look at the new mammography study, said Dr. Peter Greenwald, the institute's director for cancer prevention. Dr. Greenwald added that there might be a simple explanation for the discrepancy among the studies analyzed by the researchers in Copenhagen. Newer treatments are saving women's lives, he said. That may mean that a woman's prognosis is nearly the same whether tumors are found early, with mammography, or later, when they can be felt. If this is the case, earlier mammography studies, conducted when treatments were less effective, would have found that screening prevents breast cancer deaths; more recent studies might not have found this effect.
The transformation of the Anchorage clinic is part of a new movement in the practice of medicine that is trying to improve the age-old and often disheartening experience of a visit to the doctor's office. It is aimed at placating patients who are fed up with long waits for appointments, jammed waiting rooms and rushed visits. And it is led by some of the very doctors whose patients were so angered. The doctors, annoyed themselves, decided that there had to be a better way. Their ideas included a new method of scheduling that was put in place at the Anchorage clinic, as well as innovations such as group office visits for up to two dozen people who wanted extra time with the doctor, scheduled telephone calls from a doctor in lieu of office visits for patients with chronic diseases that require vigilance and giving patients access, online, to their medical records.
Until recently, most scientists considered anti-aging treatments to be little more than snake oil, provided by hucksters. Now, few doubt that growth hormone and testosterone can reshape aging bodies, potentially making them more youthful. But whether they counteract aging is unknown. And their long-term risks are ill defined. So medical experts ask whether it is right to regard aging as a disease, as fierce as a malignant cancer, to be fought with any and all means, tested or not. ''How much are you willing to pay for a treatment that is not proven?'' asked Dr. Huber Warner, an associate director at the National Institute on Aging. ''How much risk are you willing to take?'' But Dr. Ronald Klatz of Chicago, the founder and director of the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine, says patients cannot wait for long-term studies, which are not even in planning stages and would take years or decades to complete. ''We'd have to wait,'' he said, ''until the baby boomers are dead and in the ground and worms' meat.''
When Ron Reagan gave his speech on stem cell research before the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday night, medical researchers were taking careful note. It was just so important to them that he get the details right, that he make no mistakes on the science and that they glean any tricks they could on how to get their message about the importance of stem cell research across. But for all the promise, and for all the fervent hopes of patients and their families that cures from stem cells will come soon, researchers say many questions in basic science remain to be answered. And experts with ethical objections to the destruction of human embryos for such research say they oppose paying for the work with public money. Scientists know the emotional, and ethical, sides in the stem cell debate. The cells are from human embryos. Many scientists hope eventually to make customized stem cells for patients by starting the cloning process, making an embryo that is genetically identical to the patient, but interrupting the clone's development when it was a few days old and extracting its stem cells. Such research can be an ethical tinderbox, they realize. They also feel frustrated and hobbled by the current restrictions on research with human embryonic stem cells. If they want federal money, scientists must agree to use only cells derived from embryos dating from before Aug. 9, 2001. Many hope for a real policy change.
Dr. Dubler said she still worried about the safety of implants over periods of longer than two years. ''So I'm faced with a problem,'' Dr. Dubler said before she made up her mind to vote yes. ''To approve something which doesn't have the data to support its safety seems to me to be irresponsible, but not to expand access seems mean.'' Dr. Miller suggested that the panel's problem reflected a deeper issue. Safety, he said, is a ratio of benefit to risk, and when it comes to implants, few agree on benefits. Some who testified at the meeting felt so strongly that breast implants were unnecessary, and even immoral, that not even a perfect safety record would persuade them that they should be sold. Others saw such an enormous benefit that they were willing to accept substantial risk. The risks of the device, in contrast, ''are pretty clear,'' Dr. Miller said. There is a short-term risk, primarily of rupture or contracture. As for long-term risks, of diseases like cancer, chronic fatigue, lupus, arthritis and neurological disorders, they have not shown up in large epidemiological studies, he said.
''Bingo,'' Dr. Simerly said. ''The lights went on.'' As adults, mice with a genetic mutation preventing them from making leptin had weaker nerve connections in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, which controls eating behavior and develops soon after birth. Perhaps, Dr. Simerly said, if he gave the leptin-deficient mice a surge of leptin early in life, mimicking what normal mice experience, he could reshape their brains, making them look like those of mice without the genetic defect. It worked, Dr. Simerly and Dr. Bouret reported, raising questions about what happens normally during development in mice, and people, that might determine whether they were destined to be fat or thin. ''Leptin acts on the brain to regulate food intake,'' Dr. Simerly said. ''If the brain pathway isn't there or is greatly reduced, you would expect that process to be deficient. Your brain is perhaps not sensing how fat you are.''
Such issues, Dr. Battey said, ''need to be addressed in animal models before any thoughtful person would go into humans.'' Correction:  August 31, 2004, Tuesday  An article in Science Times last Tuesday about the complexities of stem cell research misspelled the name of a diabetes center that helps finance research by Dr. Douglas A. Melton, a Harvard developmental biologist. It is the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center of Columbia University, not Berry.
When it comes to mammals, the only way anyone has found to extend their lives is to restrict their food, giving them about 40 percent fewer calories than they would eat if left to their own devices, Dr. Helfand noted. Then they live 30 percent longer than would be expected. Working with yeast, Dr. Leonard Guarente of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology recently reported finding a gene that the yeast cells needed to allow caloric restriction to prolong life. Dr. Helfand and his colleagues stumbled upon their long-lived flies by accident. They had been inserting genetic fragments at random in fly DNA to study disruptions in a different gene. This method creates thousands of flies with altered genes. In their experiment, Dr. Helfand and his colleagues had a group of flies that they were using as a comparison group. These flies had the inserted genetic fragment, but the fragments were nowhere near the gene that the scientists were studying. Then something peculiar happened. The control flies were living much too long.
Lung cancer screening with CT scans does not appear to save lives and exposes people to serious risks of injury and even death from needless surgery, researchers are reporting today. The results are a disappointment, the researchers say. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths among men and women and kills more Americans than the four next most deadly cancers combined. For decades, cancer specialists have hoped to show that early detection and treatment can save lives. The first efforts, using chest X-rays, were disappointing. But many hoped that the more sensitive CT scans could find cancers early enough to make a difference. ''When we took this study on, we were expecting that CT might do the job where chest X-rays couldn't,'' said Dr. Peter B. Bach, the study's lead author and a lung specialist and epidemiologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. But, Dr. Bach added, his hopes were dashed.
''Even the same teams that succeeded with other species failed with these,'' Dr. Wilmut said. In general, he said, just 1 to 4 percent of cloning efforts in the species where it has worked results in the birth of a live animal. That, he said, indicates that cloning appears to create serious abnormalities in almost all embryos. The monkey work began because scientists and the National Institutes of Health urgently wanted genetically identical monkeys for research. The hope was to use them in testing drugs and vaccines, for example, or understanding the likelihood of getting diseases. Cloning seemed a natural way to proceed. In 1997, Dr. Don P. Wolf, a senior scientist at the Oregon Regional Primate Research Center, announced an important advance. He had taken a cell from a monkey embryo and used it to clone a monkey that would have been the identical twin of that embryo if it had been allowed to develop.
Even if one assumes that there is a ton of depleted uranium dust for every square kilometer in Kosovo, he said, its radiation would be just one one-hundredth, or 1 percent, of the naturally occurring level of radiation in the environment. ''So this is not a very significant hazard,'' he said. Moreover, uranium 238 emits alpha radiation, said Dr. Michael Thun, who directs epidemiological research for the American Cancer Society, and that radiation does not even penetrate the skin. The radiation that is known to cause leukemia, gamma rays and X-rays, passes through the body and reaches the marrow, damaging cells and giving rise to disease. Uranium is a heavy metal, and as with all heavy metals it can be toxic. When it enters the body, it lodges in the kidney, which it can damage. But studies of a handful of gulf war soldiers who were hit by friendly fire and left with fragments of uranium 238 in their bodies have been reassuring, said Dr. Charles Phelps, the provost at the University of Rochester and a member of an Institute of Medicine committee that reported on the problem last year.
Women taking estrogen wondered if they had done the right thing. Others who had refused the drug felt vindicated. But the real answer, for now, is that the estrogen question is still a work in progress. Far from being a medical certainty that hormone replacement therapy protects against heart disease, preliminary data suggest, in fact, that the drugs might cause a slight increase in heart attacks and strokes, at least in the first two years that women take them. The results are sketchy, and the risk, if any, seems very slight. Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which is running the study, said women taking the therapy should not stop because of it. But the finding brings to the fore one of the great conundrums of American medicine: a leading reason for using the best-selling drug in America has never been established and might well not be true.
The marketing of growth hormone took off in 1990 with the publication of one preliminary study of 12 men, indicating that they had lost fat and gained muscle. Soon afterward, researchers said, anti-aging clinics sprang up to offer the drug, at a cost of $1,000 or more a month, to people looking for a way to turn back the clock. Growth hormone, made by Genentech, Eli Lilly &amp; Company and others, is approved for use by children and adults with rare medical conditions that make them lack it. But once a drug is on the market, doctors can prescribe it at their discretion. In just the last four years, according to IMS Health, a company that tracks drug sales, prescriptions for growth hormone made by Genentech and Eli Lilly have more than tripled, rising to 21,000 in 2001 from 6,000 in 1997. While some prescriptions are for legitimate uses, medical experts say, many others are not. For example, growth hormone is also used by athletes and bodybuilders, with magazines directed toward these groups advertising its availability. The current issue of Men's Fitness, for example, has three ads for growth hormone, providing telephone numbers that people can call for a list of doctors who will prescribe the drug.
With esophageal cancer, for example, ''you literally double your odds by going to a high-volume center,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. The five-year survival rate for patients going to hospitals that did four or fewer esophageal operations a year was 17 percent. The five-year survival rate for patients going to hospitals that did more than 14 operations a year was 34 percent. Dr. Robert J. Downey, a thoracic surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he stopped doing operations for esophageal cancer because he was doing only about one a month, not enough, he decided, for optimal results. Yet Dr. Birkmeyer's study finds that fully a third of patients have the operation at hospitals doing four or fewer such surgeries in a year. It may not matter, Dr. Downey said, whether someone with esophageal cancer ''goes to a Memorial Sloan-Kettering or a Columbia-Presbyterian,'' two of New York's teaching hospitals. What matters, he said, is whether they go to a hospital that does more than just a few operations. With breast cancer, Dr. Birkmeyer said, women who go to medical centers that see large numbers of such patients tend to live longer than women who go to centers that see fewer.
What he meant, Dr. Cohen added, was that ''the little scab on the top was gone.'' Of course, the cancer specialist knew that -- he knew all about cancer, but he was not about to admit it. Only after enormous effort was Dr. Cohen able to persuade him to have the necessary surgery. Dr. Richard Schubert, an internist in private practice in Washington, told of a male patient in his 50's with ''absolutely outrageous cholesterol, around 400.'' Dr. Schubert urged him to take a statin, one of a stunningly effective class of drugs that can make cholesterol levels plummet. What did the patient do? ''He takes the medication for six weeks and doesn't renew it,'' Dr. Schubert said. ''He never comes in for a follow-up.'' Dr. Schubert worried that the man might pay an enormous price for his cavalier behavior. His father had died of a heart attack, making it much more likely that the man would have a heart attack, too -- possibly a fatal one. So, in utter frustration, Dr. Schubert called his patient at his office to have a word with him. ''He hasn't returned my call,'' Dr. Schubert said.
In a recent paper in Clinical Trials, Dean Fergusson, an epidemiologist at the Ottawa Health Research Institute in Canada, and his colleagues found 64 clinical trials had been conducted on the drug aprotinin, all asking if patients who received it during surgery had fewer transfusions. The answer was always yes. It is easy to see why these studies were done, said Dr. Steven Goodman, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University and an editor of Clinical Trials. Nearly all were so small, with perhaps a few dozen subjects, that they did not need a sponsor to finance them. ''They are already doing surgery and the drug is used at the discretion of the surgeon,'' Dr. Goodman said. ''The only cost is maintaining a small database.'' But Dr. Goodman said the larger issue is whether later medical researchers who studied aprotinin erred in giving placebos to some patients when there already was research showing that the drug resulted in fewer transfusions.
She was a junior in high school, 5 foot 6 and weighing 115 pounds. Anyone would say she was thin, but she decided she had a weight problem because she thought her hips bulged too much when she wore a bikini. ''I thought I had this disgusting problem,'' she said. The next year, however, she weighed even more -- 120 pounds. ''I remember thinking, 'This is all wrong. I was supposed to go down. I wasn't supposed to go up,' '' Ms. Barton said. ''I was flipping out.'' Then came college, and the beginning of a real weight problem. At Wheaton College, an all-woman institution in Massachusetts, the students would joke about ''the freshman 20,'' the 20 pounds that freshmen often gained. Ms. Barton far exceeded it. In her first two years, she gained 60 pounds, topping the scales at 180. Her weight gain was no mystery. ''I was bingeing,'' she said. Miserable about they way she looked, she tried desperately to lose weight.
The next step in cloning of any other animal is to replace the egg's genes with those of an adult and let the cloned embryo grow in the lab for several days. But no one has been able to grow dog embryos in the lab. So the South Koreans quickly started the cloning. They removed the genetic material from the eggs and replaced it with skin cells from the ears of Afghan hounds. When the altered eggs were starting to develop into embryos, the researchers anesthetized a female dog, slipped the eggs into the animal's oviduct, and hoped the eggs would grow into early embryos, drift into the uterus, and survive. They found they had less than four hours after starting the process to get the eggs into the female dogs. Ordinarily, researchers give hormones to female animals that are to serve as surrogate mothers, preparing them to become pregnant with a cloned embryo. Not so with dogs. No one knows how to prepare a dog for pregnancy, so the researchers used the same dogs for egg donors and for surrogate mothers, 123 dogs in all.
So he gave growth hormone to 12 elderly men for six months, reporting that they gained muscle and lost fat. Nine men who served as controls had no such body changes. In his paper, published on July 5, 1990, in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Rudman concluded with this sentence: ''The effects of six months of growth hormone on lean body mass and adipose-tissue mass were equivalent in magnitude to the changes incurred during 10 to 20 years of aging.'' Dr. Klatz, of the Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine, called the paper ''a thunderclap in the medical profession.'' ''It was the first clinical paper in a mainstream U.S. medical journal to show that there were available interventions that could have a dramatic effect on the physiology of aging,'' he said. Human growth hormone has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use by people with medical deficiencies, and once a drug is on the market, doctors can legally prescribe it for any reason.
Low-calorie diets, in animals at least, increase resistance to dying from infections or from the stress of extreme temperatures. Such diets also prompt the release of things like antioxidants and proteins that protect cells, said Dr. Huber Warner, director of the biology of aging program at the National Institute on Aging. Even the discovery, announced last month that a chemical in red wine, resveratrol, mimics the response to starvation in yeast and fruit flies, is part of the stress story -- it activates a protein, sirtuin, made in response to stress. You may not even have to diet every day, Dr. Mattson says. He put mice on a program in which they starved one day and ate their fill the next. The animals did not lose any weight, but they lived 30 percent longer than mice that ate every day and the same as mice placed on a constant diet. The intermittent diet also elicited the same mild stress response as a constant diet.
''In defense of the F.D.A., there's a tremendous amount of political pressure,'' he said. ''They want to make sure they've dotted every i and crossed every t.'' ''I could have predicted what the F.D.A. was going to ask for,'' Dr. Spear said. Some of the agency's requests may prove difficult, he said. For example, Dr. Spear said, it was no surprise that the agency wanted tests that could predict whether an implant would rupture. Now, companies pummel implants millions of times, showing, Dr. Spear said, that ''they were very, very sturdy.'' But that test was useless in predicting what would happen when devices were put into a woman's body. ''The F.D.A. wants a better test. That's not unreasonable.'' In the end, Dr. Spear said, he thinks that the company will find a way to get the requested data. ''I think silicone gel implants will be approved eventually,'' he said.
Scientists in Portland, Ore., report that they have inserted a foreign gene into a monkey egg, fertilized the egg and produced a baby monkey with the added gene in its cells. The scientists say they believe that this is the first time researchers have used techniques of genetic engineering to alter an unfertilized egg of a primate, intending that the change  be passed on to future generations. The gene, which comes from a jellyfish, is only a marker -- it causes cells to make a protein that glows under a fluorescent light. And in this case, though the monkey's cells have the gene, they are not making the protein, the researchers report. Further, it is too soon to tell whether the monkey's sperm will contain the added gene. ''In many ways this is an incremental step,'' said Dr. Gerald Schatten, the senior author of the report,  published today in the journal Science. Dr. Schatten is a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and cell and developmental biology at Oregon Health Sciences University.
Mike Gallo was 63 years old when he joined one of the world's fastest-growing fraternities. He had reeled through the shock of learning that he had cancer, a B-cell lymphoma. He had endured the potent doses of chemotherapy, the exhaustion, the mouth sores. He lost every strand of his flowing wavy red hair. And now he is emerging on the other side. He is happy the cancer was caught. He is happy that he is alive. But he finds himself tagged with a curious and confusing label: cancer survivor. [Page A14.] Before he became one, Dr. Gallo, the associate director for cancer prevention and control at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey in New Brunswick, thought he understood what it meant to be a cancer survivor. Now, he says, he realizes that he had no idea how it would change him, and how little was known about people like him. ''I had intellectualized what cancer was about,'' he said.
Many men, he explained, simply do not like being told what to do. ''The idea of someone else controlling your life is very difficult,'' he said. ''A doctor sitting behind a desk, wagging a finger -- that puts them back to almost an infantile stage. They rebel.'' Male doctors say they understand the impulse. And -- no surprise -- the most macho patients of all are the surgeons. ''As surgeons, we're control freaks,'' Dr. Cohen, the plastic surgeon, said. ''We're the worst patients. We don't want to talk about illness.'' Dr. Michler, the heart surgeon, noted: ''It gets to the heart of this whole male concept of manliness and virility and the ability not to cry for help. They are out there playing.'' If athletes can play through injuries, men reason, ''What's a little heart disease?'' Dr. Michler said. Of course, he added ruefully, ''I'm afraid that I probably do the same thing.''
While there may be opposition to Medicare's newly aggressive approach, patients, and taxpayers, can only be better off, Dr. Califf said. ''We have a huge budget deficit and looming huge costs for health care,'' he said. ''And we know we are spending huge amounts of money on things that don't work. But we don't know what they are.'' So, he said, the nation has a choice. ''Medicare could pay for everything, or we could develop a rational system to pay for the things that matter.''
Dr. Neumann explained that there are always ways to get around cryptography barriers and that these methods have nothing to do with breaking codes. ''It's like the voting machines,'' he said. ''You'd like to have some integrity in the electoral process and now folks are coming out of the woodwork saying, 'We have this perfect algorithm for privacy and security.' '' But, he said, while the systems may use cryptography to make sure that when someone touches a screen to vote, that vote is transmitted with perfect security, who's to ensure the integrity of the person who programs the computer? ''There is no guarantee that your vote actually goes into the computer the way it looks on the touch screen,'' Dr. Neumann said. ''What does it take to buy a computer programmer? A couple of years' salary and a house in the Cayman Islands?'' Bruce Schneier, who is founder and chief technical officer for Counterpane Internet Security in San Jose, said that, as a scientist, he liked the idea of a provably secure system. ''Research like this should be encouraged,'' he said. ''But research is different from engineering.''
FIRST we said they were ruining their health with their bad habit, and they should just quit. Then we said they were repulsive and we didn't want to be around them. Then we said they were costing us loads of money -- maybe they should pay extra taxes. Other Americans, after all, do not share their dissolute ways. Cigarette smokers? No, the obese. Last week the list of ills attributable to obesity grew: fat people cause global warming. This latest contribution to the obesity debate comes in an article by Sheldon H. Jacobson of the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana and his doctoral student, Laura McLay. Their paper, published in the current issue of The Engineering Economist, calculates how much extra gasoline is used to transport Americans now that they have grown fatter. The answer, they said, is a billion gallons a year. Their conclusion is in the same vein as a letter published last year in The American Journal of Public Health. Its authors, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, did a sort of back-of-the-envelope calculation of how much extra fuel airlines spend hauling around fatter Americans. The answer, they wrote, based on the extra 10 pounds the average American gained in the 1990's, is 350 million gallons, which means an extra 3.8 million tons of carbon dioxide.
The doctors at Gastroenterology Associates in Rockford, Ill., also added Saturday hours just for screening colonoscopies. Still, the wait is several months. The colonoscopy boom took the Rockford doctors aback, changing the nature of their practice, said Dr. James T. Frakes, a gastroenterologist with the group. ''It's been huge,'' Dr. Frakes said. ''We get several hundred colonoscopy referrals a week.'' In Chapel Hill, N.C., where the routine wait is as much as six to eight months, Dr. Michael Pignone, an internist at the University of North Carolina, worries about patients with potentially serious symptoms, like blood in the stool, being put in a queue for a test. ''I go around the system,'' he says, calling gastroenterologists himself for appointments. In DeForest, Wis., 20 minutes from Madison, the waiting lists for the colonoscopies are closed to healthy patients. Dr. Peter Pickhardt, a family practitioner, says he has learned to be blunt with patients. ''I tell them up front,'' he said. ''If they want a colonoscopy, it's not available.''
And that includes psychological preparation, says Gloria Balague, who directs sports psychology services at the Sports Medicine Center and Human Performance Lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago. ''You can't just hope to have a good day,'' Dr. Balague said. Mr. Spence's experience shows how preparation and planning -- even without the advances of the last decade -- can determine who wins a race. At 6 a.m. on race day in Tokyo, the temperature was already in the 70's and humidity was high. Mr. Spence knew he could not keep up his usual pace in those conditions, so his strategy was to run slower than usual and hope his training would pull him through, allowing him to speed up at the end while the faster runners faded. The gun went off, and the other runners quickly pulled ahead. ''You begin to wonder, 'Where am I?' '' Mr. Spence recalled. ''The leaders are so far ahead of me that I'll never catch up.'' Would they really wilt and fall behind on the 26-mile course?
The peanut study had difficulty recruiting subjects. Many feared the initial sensitivity tests. It required eating small amounts of peanuts while doctors watched for reactions like hives or breathing problems. ''They are monitored, they have IV's in place, and as soon as they start having a reaction, we treat them,'' Dr. Sampson said. Patients were reluctant. They also worried they would get the placebo. Brian Dieffenbacher, 35, joined the study in Denver. Mr. Dieffenbacher, a project manager for I.B.M., said: ''I thought I would just tough it out. A couple of times I toughed it out right to the hospital.'' After taking the drug, he said, he went to a Mexican restaurant and bit a chip. ''It did not taste right,'' he said. ''So I opened the menu and saw that it was cooked in peanut oil.'' That was the extent of his reaction, he said, no choking, no hives.
Academic medical centers also got into the business, including Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard, which opened Be Well Body Scan. The center is owned by the Beth Israel Radiology Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports the hospital's radiology department. Dr. Max Rosen, medical director of the scanning service, says he has saved lives, finding a lung cancer at a stage when it could be removed, he says, and a heart problem that led to a bypass operation. At Yale, Dr. Howard Forman, an associate professor of diagnostic radiology and management, said he had felt pressure from hospital administrators to explore the possibility of offering whole body scans to healthy people. He could see why. ''From a profitability standpoint, you would go in this direction.'' But he and his colleagues resisted. ''There is no evidence that the scans are good medicine,'' Dr. Forman said. Dr. Barnett Kramer, director of the National Institutes of Health's office of disease prevention, said: ''For every 100 healthy people who undergo a scan, somewhere between 30 and 80 of them will be told that there is something that needs a workup -- and it will turn out to be nothing.''
Prof. Lori B. Andrews of the Chicago-Kent College of Law, who studies new reproductive technologies, said she worried about what the experiment might mean for the future of genetic manipulations in people. ''Once you start attempting genetic engineering in monkeys, humans can't be far behind,'' Professor Andrews said. There is widespread agreement that genetically modified mice long used in research on human diseases have serious limitations. Dr. Richard Tasca, who is program director in the reproductive sciences branch of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, said those limitations were behind the National Institutes of Health's decision to finance the research. With some diseases, Dr. Tasca said, ''a mouse is not close enough to a human.'' Some researchers noted the preliminary nature of the Oregon work. ''It's got the DNA in there, so its a transgenic animal,'' said Dr. Brigid Hogan, a professor of cell biology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and an investigator with the Howard Medical Institute. ''But unless you can show a high level of expression of the protein, it's not something you should be making a big fuss about and making extravagant claims about. I would be feeling very tentative about whether he had achieved the goals he had set out.''
Dr. Jaenisch said he knew of no test that answered that question. ''Subtle changes are very hard to detect,'' he said, adding that brain function would be of particular concern if anyone tried to clone a human being. But Dr. Jaenisch added that his worries did not apply to therapeutic cloning. Another critic of human cloning, Dr. Mark E. Westhusin, a cloning researcher at Texas A&amp;M University, said the question was not whether clones that survive to adulthood are normal -- it was what happens to those that do not survive or that survive only after a rocky start. With cows, Dr. Westhusin said, the data on clones are consistent. ''Ninety percent will abort,'' he said. ''Most others will have respiratory problems or the early onset of cardiovascular problems. The concerns of pregnancy and the first few days or weeks of life are the concerns at hand.''
Some statisticians ask whether it is worthwhile to keep pouring money and effort into searches for clusters and searches to explain them. ''The question is, at what point do you say we've see too many like this?'' Dr. Robins asked. ''Huge amounts of money'' have gone to study disease clusters where the suspected cause was tiny amounts of chemicals, he added, and so far, ''nothing has come of it.''
Boston University expects to own about 20 percent of the company's stock, said David Lampe, a university spokesman. In addition to that 20 percent, Mr. Lampe said, the university will donate some stock to a trust that will be administered for the benefit of participants in the Framingham study, a way of compensating people who have cooperated in the effort for so many years without any payment. The details of the arrangement are still being worked out, with crucial features, like an ethics adviser to represent the research participants themselves, still under discussion. But the company and the university are confident that the remaining questions can be resolved. And others said the agreement was a natural consequence of medicine's increasing thirst for data that can link medical and genetic information. ''This is the beginning of a new era,'' said Dr. Arthur Holden, chairman and chief executive of the SNP Consortium, a collaboration of 14 companies, mostly drug makers, that are creating a publicly available map of the human genome, concentrating on individual places on DNA where people differ. ''The demand for genetic databases is beginning to increase, and many of the leading university centers are beginning to think about how they can commercialize their samples and data sets.''
''I would sort of compare them to Wal-Mart coming in and taking over from all the mom and pops','' said Dr. William West, who works at an abortion clinic in Dallas. The Planned Parenthood issue, said Carole Joffee, a sociologist who is a visiting professor at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania, is part of ''the identity crisis of abortion. All other forms of health care are part of a market. Is abortion part of the health care industry? Or is it part of a social movement?'' Gloria Feldt, the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said that her group has a slightly different focus than independent providers. ''As a nonprofit organization our mission is to make sure that every woman has access to reproductive health services -- including abortion -- regardless of their ability to pay,'' she said. In keeping with that mission, Planned Parenthood has expanded its abortion services over the past decade, Ms. Feldt said. In 1991, 91 out of 199 Planned Parenthood health centers offered abortions. In 1999, 147 out of 876 offered them. But, Ms. Feldt said, she does not see a conflict between her group and independent clinics since they often coexist peacefully, even sharing doctors.  ''We each fill an important niche in the community,'' she said. In addition, Ms. Feldt said, Planned Parenthood advocates and litigates to provide a social climate that enables abortion clinics to exist.
He told Mr. Gilmartin and got his agreement. On Tuesday, Merck notified its board and that afternoon the company told the F.D.A. On Wednesday, the company began notifying regulatory agencies in other countries. Yesterday morning, Merck made its public announcement. Although Mr. Kim said he was stunned by the data, others were less surprised. The possibility that Vioxx might increase the risk of heart attacks first emerged three years ago, in a Merck study of 7,000 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. The company was asking whether those taking a high dose of Vioxx, 50 milligrams a day, had fewer gastrointestinal side effects than those who were randomly assigned to take naproxen. The results showed that the Vioxx patients had half the incidence of gastrointestinal complaints, but it also indicated that they had five times the number of heart attacks -- five per thousand patients as compared to one per thousand with naproxen.
But what if bucindolol was marketed with the genetic test and the test also identified people who would do better with the beta blockers currently on the market? Which drug should they take? Should nonresponders take any beta blocker at all? The only way to find out would be to do a huge clinical trial of all the drugs using the genetic test, Dr. Liggett said, and who, he asked, would pay for that? Drug companies probably would not do it, he said, because it was not in their economic interest, and the government can sponsor only so many studies. Another drug whose fortunes may change with a genetic test is tamoxifen, which ushered in one of the greatest advances in breast cancer treatment. By starving tumors of estrogen, tamoxifen stanches their growth and saves women's lives. But tamoxifen must be activated by a liver enzyme and, Dr. Flockhart of Indiana University and his colleagues found, not everyone's enzymes activate the drug.
Even so, there is hardly wide agreement over whether this new technique, known as multidetector CT scans of the heart, is entirely a good thing. Indeed, critics say, the technology is ripe for overuse, with doctors scanning people who do not need to be scanned and finding -- and fixing -- medical problems that do not need to be fixed. Even within one institution, cardiologists differ. The scans ''will completely revolutionize medicine,'' said Dr. Mario J. Garcia, director of the echocardiography lab at the Cleveland Clinic. Diagnosis of heart disease, he argued, will be transformed, and lives saved. Dr. Garcia gave an example: Most people who come to an emergency room with chest pains have a pulled muscle and are not having a heart attack. Yet many are admitted to the hospital and observed for 24 hours. ''That's very expensive,'' he said. ''You have to do blood tests and monitor the heart for a day and maybe do a stress test before they let you go home.'' If the tests look suspicious, the patient is sent for an angiogram.
Leigh Todd spent four years and $300,000 to have a baby. She saw 10 doctors and sought help at medical clinics in New York, Chicago and Las Vegas. And while Ms. Todd says she had no idea what she was in for when she began her quest, it did not take long before she was sucked into a world of tests and treatments, conventional and unconventional, doing whatever it took, paying as much as was asked. ''I was driven,'' recalled Ms. Todd, who lives in Bedford, N.Y. Her story is far from unique. Most couples cannot afford what she spent: she charged the bills for her treatments on her husband's credit card. But more and more women are entering the fertility vortex and finding that despite themselves, they will go as far as needed, spend whatever they can scrape up, take out second and third mortgages on their homes, and travel across the country and even overseas for tests and treatments, all in the hope of becoming pregnant.
A number of years ago, five families in Brooklyn who had had babies with a devastating disease decided to try what was then nearly unthinkable: to eliminate a terrible genetic disease from the planet. The disease is Tay-Sachs, a progressive, relentless neurological disorder that afflicts mostly babies, leaving them mentally impaired, blind, deaf and unable to swallow. There is no treatment, and most children with the disease die by 5. The families raised money and, working with geneticists, began a program that focused on a specific population, Ashkenazi Jews, who are most at risk of harboring the Tay-Sachs gene. The geneticists offered screening to see whether family members carried the gene. It became an international effort, fueled by passion and involving volunteers who went to synagogues, Jewish community centers, college Hillel houses, anywhere they might reach people of Ashkenazic ancestry and enroll them in the screening and counsel them about the risks of having babies with the disease. If two people who carried the gene married, they were advised about the option of aborting affected fetuses.
When the study began, the patients' cholesterol was no higher than the level specified by the national guidelines. But those who began taking Lipitor were later found to have a median L.D.L. level far below that -- 62, compared with 95 among those who took Pravachol. Within a month, the Lipitor patients started doing better than those taking Pravachol in terms of lower rates of heart attack, bypass surgery, angioplasty and death. The study closely follows one sponsored by Pfizer, Lipitor's maker, that was reported in November at a meeting of the American Heart Association and published last week in The Journal of the American Medical Association. That study, too, compared effects of 40 milligrams of Pravachol against 80 milligrams of Lipitor in heart patients, looking at the rate that plaque grew in coronary arteries. Lipitor, the study found, halted plaque growth; Pravachol slowed but did not stop it. But Bristol-Myers Squibb and some cardiologists cautioned then that the Pfizer study, directed by Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, fell short of proof. A halt in the growth of plaque, they said, was not necessarily the same as a reduction in heart attacks and deaths. Bristol-Myers Squibb sent out its sales force to tell doctors to wait for its own, more definitive study before abandoning Pravachol.
At menopause, levels of estrogen drop precipitously. Healthy men, in contrast, have a slow, steady decline in testosterone, about one-half of 1 percent a year, starting about age 30. Testosterone levels are 10 to 15 percent lower in men with diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and obesity, among other conditions, he said. In young men with low testosterone levels, the problem is clear. They lose muscle and gain fat. They also lose bone, have decreased stamina, are less able to maintain an erection and lose mental sharpness. Testosterone reverses these symptoms. The effect on older men is less clear. In some studies, it increased bone density and muscle tissue. But Dr. Alvin Matsumoto a geriatrics researcher at the University of Washington and the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System, said the studies were too small and too brief to address the treatment's potential risks -- prostate cancer, heart attacks and strokes.
Candace Steele, a Wyeth spokeswoman, said in an e-mail message that ''breast cancer is a complex disease and the causes are not known. At this point, she said, ''it is simply inappropriate to make any speculative statements'' based on the analysis. And, she added, ''clearly, more studies are warranted.'' Dr. Berry said that the biggest effect overall was seen in women ages 50 to 69. That, he added, is the group most likely to have been taking menopausal hormones. In them, the incidence of breast cancer, including the type that grows in response to estrogen and the one that does not, fell by 12 percent in 2003, the latest year for which data is available. The findings of the new analysis were supported by a separate study in California. That study, published in the Nov. 20 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, found an even bigger drop in rates in that state and a correspondingly bigger drop in hormone use starting in July 2002.
Or maybe not. Dr. Goodman recently sat in on a consultation with a leukemia patient whose doctor told her that the treatment, a bone marrow transplant, would reduce her chance of dying from the disease. But the treatment itself could prove fatal. In the end, treatment did not budge the mortality rate. The woman, Dr. Goodman said, chose to be treated. She said, Dr. Goodman recalled, ''I'd rather go down fighting.'' PERSPECTIVES
CONFRONTING CANCER
Many insurers pay for the test, whose list price at one national testing laboratory, Quest Diagnostics, is $55, according to Gary Samuels, a company spokesman. ''Plans that haven't covered it are re-evaluating it in light of the new studies,'' he said. Scientists have known for some time that CRP levels can predict the risk of heart attack as powerfully as better-known risk factors like high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The higher the CRP level, the greater the risk. But they still did not know whether reducing the level would reduce the risk. The new studies addressed that by analyzing what happened when heart patients took statins, the drugs that lower cholesterol. Statins, it turns out, also lower CRP levels, but that effect is independent of their effect on cholesterol. That allowed the investigators to ask: Is lowering CRP independently protecting patients from heart attacks and the worsening of atherosclerosis?
''It's a big problem,'' said Abbey Meyers, the executive director of the National Organization for Rare Disorders, an advocacy group based in Fairfield, Conn. ''If your life depends on one of these products, you can't take a chance on buying an over-the-counter supplement that may contain no ingredient or half the ingredient or two or three times more of the ingredient.'' Ms. Meyers said her group financed a study in which Duke University scientists analyzed over-the-counter L-carnitine supplements from a variety of companies. They found that doses varied markedly, even in pills coming from the same bottle, with some pills containing no carnitine, others containing more than the label specified and most providing less than 60 percent of the dose promised on the label. And yet, said Lynn McHenry Morgan of Concord, Calif., when she changed insurance companies last February, her new insurer, Blue Shield, told her it would not pay for prescription L-carnitine for her two children, who need the drug to treat a rare and debilitating disorder involving the mitochondria, which provide energy to cells.
His plan is to search for the factories with tools used to study origins of species. If, for example, scientists want to know the history of a species with numerous subspecies, like the leopards of Asia, North Africa, Central Africa and South Africa, they may look at the genetic profiles of the animals and build evolutionary trees. The idea is to find a genetic pathway that can lead from a common ancestor to the leopards seen today by means of a few genetic changes. ''Suppose you consider the human body as the world, the whole ecosystem,'' Dr. O'Brien said. ''The AIDS virus comes into all these tissues. The immune system kills it in some tissues, but not in others.'' And as it moves from tissue to tissue, it divides and mutates, creating a path that may be traced back to its origins. Might it be possible, he asks, to reconstruct the virus's evolutionary history -- and find the H.I.V. factory -- within the body by examining the genes of viruses from different tissues?
Andrea C. Masciale, a lawyer for the agency, explained that all Duchesnay had to do was show the F.D.A. that its generic Bendectin was chemically the same as the original drug. No clinical studies or research are required, which simplifies the process of its reintroduction. ''We think they can achieve a product that is the same as Bendectin and therefore come in with a generic version of Bendectin,'' Ms. Masciale said. The development has stunned medical and legal experts, who say that the possible Lazarus-like re-emergence of Bendectin is so bold and unprecedented that they are at a loss for comparisons. For many drug companies, birth defect experts, obstetricians and law professors, the Bendectin story is unforgettable. Bendectin is the only drug withdrawn from the market solely because of litigation, said Jeffrey Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Even the United States Supreme Court eventually weighed in on the matter.
As Dr. Blazer's committee set to work, the nation's experience with hormone therapy for menopausal women was on the minds of the members. Millions of women had taken estrogen and progestin for years, even decades, believing that it would protect against heart disease, osteoporosis, maybe even Alzheimer's disease. Many felt it kept them youthful and vigorous. But when the National Institutes of Health did a large study of the hormones in healthy women, it found that the drugs had risks, of heart disease and breast cancer, that were not outweighed by their benefits. No one wanted to repeat that experience with testosterone, Dr. Blazer said. The committee searched for evidence that testosterone helped aging men. Many symptoms of aging -- weakness, diminished sex drive, osteoporosis and a sense of malaise -- occur in young men who do not make testosterone. The symptoms are reversed with testosterone therapy. Testosterone levels gradually fall as men grow older.
That, said Dr. Matsumoto, was a real problem. ''The major concern for everyone who is even remotely considering treating older individuals is prostate cancer and heart disease,'' he said. About three years ago, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institute on Aging were inviting researchers to submit proposals to study testosterone replacement in aging men with low levels of the hormone. Dr. Matsumoto and Dr. Glenn Cunningham of Baylor College of Medicine and the Houston V.A. Medical Center proposed a large study to determine the drug's risks and benefits: a six-year clinical trial with 6,000 men at 40 medical centers. It would cost about $110 million. But in June, after extensive discussions among the Department of Veterans Affairs and the National Institutes of Health, a decision was made not to go ahead. The unanswered question was whether or how a clinical trial could be designed that would protect the study's subjects from the drug's potential risks and provide definitive data on its potential benefits.
''There hasn't been enough time for the common variants to build up,'' Dr. Lander said. For each gene, there might be two, or three, common variations at one or two  positions in the gene sequence, not hundreds. ''It becomes a finite problem,'' Dr. Lander said. ''It is within reach.'' That insight converted him into one of the pioneers in the search for genetic variants that can predict individual differences in responses to illness and responses to drugs, a field known as pharmacogenetics. Around the same time Dr. Lander was realizing that each gene might have just a few variants, Dr. Liggett, then a researcher at Duke University, was starting to see what such variants might mean for patients. Dr. Liggett was intrigued by one particular gene, the beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene. It directs cells to make a protein that helps relax muscles in the airways of the lungs and contract muscles in the heart. Drugs for asthma attach themselves to the protein, setting off a cascade of biochemical events inside the cells that makes the airways dilate. Drugs for congestive heart failure also attach themselves to the protein, this time making heart muscles contract.
According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group that represents large drug companies, four out of five drugs that enter Phase 1 never make it to market, failing because they are too toxic or turn out to be ineffective. The recent news about the Alzheimer's vaccine came from the start of a Phase 1 study -- not even a completed study -- just preliminary results on two dozen patients who had received a single dose of the vaccine. All that could be said was that it appeared to be safe, so far. Dr. James E. Barrett, vice president for neuroscience at Wyeth-Ayerst Research, American Home Products' pharmaceutical research unit, said his company was working with Elan to test the vaccine. The Phase 1 study, Dr. Barrett said, will include about 100 Alzheimer's patients and will test several doses. If this treatment is not too dangerous, efficacy studies will begin involving hundreds of patients.
But, the scientist said, while the cancer risk of dioxin might be much greater than previously estimated, Americans were now exposed to less of the pollutant. Dioxin is formed, for example, when chlorine-containing chemicals, like plastics or industrial wastes, are burned, or when pulp and paper are bleached. The chemical can waft through the air or be carried in dust, settling on plants that are eaten by animals. Once ingested, dioxin accumulates in the fat. When humans eat the animals, or when they consume dairy products having fat, like milk, dioxin enters their bodies, where it remains, stored in fat. Since the 1970's, however, pollution controls have caused dioxin levels in the environment to drop. As a result, people now have less dioxin in their bodies. The agency scientist said that even though many foods contained dioxin, the food supply was safe. Though dioxin gets into breast milk, he said, the benefits of breast feeding far exceed the risks from dioxin.
Then there is the issue of the way the gene was inserted -- with a retrovirus, which can randomly insert genes into DNA and could potentially cause disease. ''If they're going to try genetic manipulations in humans, then they're certainly not going to use retroviruses,'' said Dr. Barry Zirkin, who is professor and head of the division of reproductive biology at Johns Hopkins University. ''It's too frightening to consider.'' ''There may be a slippery slope somewhere,'' Dr. Zirkin said, ''but this can't be it.''
In 1990, Dr. Land said, he went to Europe with a group of opponents of abortion, like the National Right to Life Committee and the Knights of Columbus, to tell executives at Roussel-Uclaf SA, the drug's maker, and its parent company, Hoechst AG, that they would face boycotts and protests if they attempted to sell the drug in the United States. (Hoechst merged with Rhone-Poulenc last December into a merged company called Aventis.) ''We told Hoechst that it would be unfortunate if they were to market the drug in the U.S. since they had an unfortunate history when it came to death-dealing materials,'' Dr. Land said. The company was part of a conglomerate that had a major interest in the chemical used in German gas chambers in World War II. ''We knew and we wanted them to know that we knew,'' Dr. Land said. Soon afterward, Roussel-Uclaf said it would not seek approval to market mifepristone here; without a new drug application, the F.D.A. could not fully assess the drug.
Dr. Carlo, an author of a new book, ''Cell Phones: Invisible Hazards in the Wireless Age'' (Carroll &amp; Graf), said he remained concerned about the dangers of cell phones, adding that studies had indicated that microwaves could cause genetic damage and could weaken the blood-brain barrier that protects the brain. Others, including Dr. Moulder and Dr. Adair, said scientists had tried to replicate those studies but had not yet succeeded. The brain-cancer question received widespread publicity in 1993, when David Reynard of St. Petersburg, Fla., appeared on CNN's ''Larry King Live,'' maintaining that his wife had contracted brain cancer from a cell phone he had bought for her. But some physicists, like Dr. Robert L. Park of the University of Maryland, asked how microwaves might cause such an effect. The radiation cannot break chemical bonds and so cannot damage genetic material, Dr. Park said. All the radiation can do is heat things up, which is why microwave ovens heat food. But cell phones use so little microwave energy that even heating is a nonissue, Dr. Park said. And digital phones, which are rapidly replacing analog models, use even less.
Second Opinion
Some walked so slowly, with tiny steps and labored cadences, that the researchers told them that they could stop because it was clear that they could never finish. Others Dr. Simonsick added, ''just said: 'I'm done. I'm sitting down.' '' ''It's very sad,'' she added. ''It's not like we put them on a treadmill and cranked it up. You get the sense that they are simply deconditioned.'' The problem became worse. ''In the first two years, a third of the group that could walk the quarter mile said they were beginning to have difficulty,'' Dr. Harris said. ''We thought, 'Oh, this is impossible.' '' But it was real. The researchers published their data in the May 3 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association, finding that being unable to walk a quarter mile within five minutes portended troubles. For each minute beyond five, the risk of dying in the next four years increased by a third, the risk of having a heart attack increased by 20 percent, and the risk of having a disability increased by half.
The hope, Dr. Baltimore and other AIDS experts said, was for a DNA vaccine to be at least as effective in humans as a combination of powerful AIDS drugs but without the drugs' expense or side effects. Uninfected people who were at high risk of infection could be vaccinated to protect them if an infection should occur. Such a vaccine could be especially important in developing countries where it could not only alleviate suffering but also, by keeping the viruses in an infected person's blood at an extremely low level, prevent the spread of AIDS. Dr. Robert F. Siliciano, a professor of medicine and an AIDS researcher at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said the study was ''a very important demonstration that immunization can work,'' against AIDS. ''The caveat is, Will we get the same effect in humans? That we don't know yet. I think it's certainly possible, but we need to do those experiments,'' Dr. Siliciano said.
That happened to Suzanne Lucchesi-Taranto, a 35-year-old Brooklyn woman. During her first pregnancy three years ago, Ms. Lucchesi-Taranto said, she vomited so much that she had to be hospitalized for a period. Sent home, she continued to vomit. ''There wasn't a drug that I didn't try,'' she said. She even took the antidepressant Zoloft intravenously, administered by a visiting nurse. Toward the end of her pregnancy, Dr. Lockwood's colleague, Dr. Andrei Rebarber, told her to take the drug combination that mimicked Bendectin, which helped, she said. Last year, pregnant again, Ms. Lucchesi-Taranto did not want to wait until the third trimester before taking the Bendectin-like drug combination. ''I said, 'Give it to me,' the minute I started throwing up,'' she said. ''They made me sign forms saying that they weren't responsible for any birth defects,'' she said. But she had confidence in the safety of the drug regimen and was not worried. Bendectin, she said, ''was the only thing that gave me any relief.''
And new studies reveal that even though drugs can protect people who already had a heart attack from having another, many patients get the wrong doses and most, Mr. Orr included, stop taking the drugs in a matter of months. They should take the drugs for the rest of their lives. ''We've done pretty well,'' Dr. Nabel said. ''But we could be doing much better. I've heard some people refer to it as the rule of halves. Half the people who need to be treated are treated and half who are treated are adequately treated.'' The result, heart researchers say, is a huge disconnect between what is possible and what is actually happening. Crucial Miscalculations Keith Orr's story has themes that resonate with every cardiologist. He did many things right, but also made some crucial miscalculations that were so common that nearly every patient makes them, cardiologists say. But not everyone comes out as well.
''People will probably look with some suspicion on claims that this will ultimately be beneficial because it is in our cultural milieu to say 'Oh, another marketing ploy,''' Ms. Knoppers said. But ''I think that, provided we proceed with caution, that it can be very beneficial,'' she added. ''There are drugs that don't work for many people, there are drugs that are dangerous. I would think that making drugs more therapeutic and safer surely is an ethical goal.'' Next in Business Day: Makers of chips used in DNA analysis are rushing to capitalize on the move toward tailor-made drugs.
But insurers have to make some tough decisions, said Dr. Madelyn H. Fernstrom, director of the weight management center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ''Let's say your weight went down 20 percent, but your blood pressure did not change,'' she said. ''Your self-esteem may be better. But the payer might say, we're glad you're happy, but the bottom line is, Are you saving the company money?''
Every athlete, every fitness enthusiast has heard the advice to drink plenty of water. Drink as much as you can. Don't wait until you are thirsty. By then it may be too late. You may be seriously dehydrated, risking dizziness, collapse, even death. ''Stay ahead of your thirst,'' athletes and would-be athletes are told. But now USA Track &amp; Field, the national governing body for track and field, long-distance running and race walking, says that advice is wrong. In what it calls a major revision of its guidelines, the organization says endurance athletes, who may be consuming huge amounts of water over the course of a long event, may risk seizures, respiratory failure and even death from drinking too much. Instead of drinking as much as they can, the new guidelines say, runners should drink when they are thirsty. People in long races like marathons may want to weigh themselves before and after long practice runs to see how much they lose from sweating and drink that amount when they race, and no more. The guidelines are at www.usatf.org.
Mr. LaLanne starts each day with a workout that would put most people a quarter his age to shame -- an hour of weight lifting followed by an hour of vigorous swimming. ''My top priority in life is my workout each day,'' he says. When he lifts weights, Mr. LaLanne says, ''I do everything to muscle failure,'' meaning that he lifts weights so heavy that when he stops, he cannot lift that weight one more time. When he swims, he says, he ties a rope around his waist and does the butterfly, a grueling stroke. Asked why he puts himself through his daily routine, Mr. LaLanne has a simple answer. ''Results,'' he says. ''It's the ego in me. I want to see how long I can keep it up.'' He has little sympathy for those who say they have no time or energy for exercise. ''If you can't afford a half hour two or three times a week to take care of your body, you've got to be sick,'' Mr. LaLanne says.
Six years ago, scientists in Canada published a remarkable paper, reporting that they had grown entire mice from individual cells that they had plucked from mouse embryos. At the time, it was seen by those in the world of mouse research as a technological tour de force. But now, as scientists are eyeing human embryo cells as material for research, the experiment is giving rise to a thorny philosophical question. If you can grow a mouse from a single embryo cell, you should in theory be able to grow a human from a single human embryo cell. And if you can do that, is the single embryo cell the moral equivalent of an entire embryo? Where, in other words, does the potential for human life lie? There are no simple answers anymore, ethicists say. ''There's a certain ambiguity or complexity that wasn't appreciated before,'' said Dr. Thomas Murray,  director of the Hastings Center, an ethics research organization.
Dr. Denise Faustman thinks she has a shot at curing diabetes. She has published one significant scientific paper after another on the disease. She has succeeded in curing it in mice, something no one else has accomplished. But when Dr. Faustman, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard, went looking for money to finance the next stage of her research, testing the ideas with diabetes patients, she could find no backers. Pharmaceutical companies turned her down. So did the Juvenile Diabetes Research Association. Her approach was criticized, even though in the past, said her boss, Dr. Joseph Avruch, chief of the diabetes unit at the Massachusetts General Hospital, ''most of the things she found turned out to be true.'' Only the support of Lee A. Iacocca, the former chief of Chrysler, who said he wanted to see diabetes cured in his lifetime, has allowed her to pursue her goal. He mounted an $11 million fund-raising campaign and wrote a $1 million check to start the fund.
While few want to talk about the money that abortion doctors can make, clinic owners and doctors agree that doctors can make several hundred thousand dollars a year working part time, a few hours a day with their fees averaging $60 for a first-trimester abortion. Although they do have hefty fees for malpractice insurance, doctors who travel from clinic to clinic have no overhead and no record keeping. But it can be hard to enter the profession. One doctor in Detroit, who spoke on condition he not be identified, saying he feared hostility from his colleagues, said that when he finished medical school, trained in obstetrics and gynecology, he asked abortion doctors in the area to train him. He was turned away. Eventually, he found a clinic whose doctor was retiring and the owner let him do abortions. Now, he travels from clinic to clinic terminating pregnancies. Ronald Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, said he gets calls from doctors looking for work but often he cannot help them.
Yet there is no effective treatment to improve patients' outcomes, Dr. Cheung said, adding that even those who survive and whose outcome after they emerge from a coma is classified ''good'' often have lifelong disabilities. They may have emotional problems, memory problems or  problems paying attention. Often they lose the ability to discern appropriate behavior from inappropriate. The idea of cooling the brain came from animal studies and small studies of head-injured patients that seemed to indicate it might improve outcomes. Soon some individual neurosurgeons began trying it, out of desperation. ''When you have a condition as bad as this and there is no proven treatment for it, you will use whatever you can think of,'' said Dr. Raj K. Narayan, professor and chairman of the department of neurosurgery at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia, who wrote an editorial accompanying the New England Journal paper. But Dr. Narayan said he himself had not used cooling, in part out of  fear that it might have adverse effects that canceled out any benefits for the brain. Cooling, he said, prevents blood from coagulating, and it can cause heart arrhythmia, lower blood pressure and have a bad effect on kidney functioning.
Then his sister-in-law, who is 22 and without health insurance, was hit by a car as she walked along a road in California. She suffered a head injury so severe that she was in a coma. Her medical bills soared to more than $500,000. Yet the man who hit her had no job and no assets and less than $20,000 in insurance, so suing him would not help. She was covered under an uninsured motorist clause in her father's car insurance policy. Soon her lawyers started negotiating prices for her medical care. The insurance company's cap was $300,000 and the lawyers, working on a contingency basis, would get a third of whatever the insurance company paid. ''Lo and behold, they got the rate down so that it fit below the cap,'' Professor Thorpe said. The medical charges were reduced to $200,000. That meant that the lawyers got their maximum amount, $100,000, and the insurance company paid its full amount, $300,000.
And what did he tell the embryologist? ''I passed the e-mail on to someone else,'' Dr. Mayer said.
But one question looms over the new research: if the body is so good at growing new cells like heart cells and pancreas cells, why does anyone develop diabetes or heart disease? Why can't the body just constantly regenerate its organs when cells die? The diabetes work provides an explanation, Dr. Faustman said. If the environment is wrong -- in this case, an underlying autoimmune disease causing diabetes -- the body's regenerative mechanisms may be unable to keep up. The same thing could happen with damaged hearts, she said. Patients with heart disease may have such severe damage to their hearts that the organs may no longer have the scaffolding or the chemical signals for new cell growth. That observation provides a warning for research on stem cells, she added. It may not be enough to provide new cells to patients if nothing is done to change their underlying disease.
The issue does not arise, at least for most people, when reconstructive breast surgery is called for, said Dr. Scott L. Spear, a professor of plastic surgery at Georgetown University and the medical monitor for Inamed's clinical trials. ''Obviously, even in breast reconstruction for cancer, the benefit is primarily for appearance,'' Dr. Spear said. ''But almost everyone would agree that if your breast is removed, replacing it is not just cosmetic.'' But, he added: ''Suppose you have a more or less normal breast. How important is it that you enhance it? I think there is an argument that the benefit is not as great, and then you get down to the issue of whose right it is to decide how valuable it is.'' In the end, Dr. Miller decided to avoid that issue, at least in his capacity as a member of the F.D.A. advisory panel, and to focus instead on what the scientific data said about the safety of implants.
All along, there have been suspicions -- but very little solid evidence -- that anabolic steroids and drugs that act like them can lead to serious long-term effects, including heart attacks, strokes and cancer. There are stories that the drugs can sometimes turn placid people violent. There are concerns that in some sports, those who want to compete have little choice but to take them. ''The average guy will tell you that he hasn't had any problems and doesn't know anyone who does,'' said Dr. Harrison G. Pope Jr., a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist who studies bodybuilding culture. Yet, he said, there are rare individuals who ''have almost a Jekyll and Hyde personality change,'' becoming aggressive and violent. That was what worried Mr. Keogan -- he quit after jumping out of his car to argue with another driver in a fit of rage, leaving his car to drift away. Now his body has shrunk to its former size, and he struggles to lift weights that were once a warm-up to his real lifting.
Others were more adamant, saying that the detection of D.C.I.S. was unlikely to have much effect if any on the breast cancer death toll but would lead to more women being told they had cancer and undergoing treatment. ''There is enormous uncertainty about what the significance of these lesions is,'' said Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, an associate professor of radiology at the University of California, San Francisco. When a test finds more D.C.I.S. and less invasive cancer, Dr. Smith-Bindman added, ''personally, I consider it a harm, not a benefit.'' In a sense, it might be expected that computer-aided detection performed the way it did, researchers said. The computer program marks four or five spots on the average screening mammogram. A radiologist then looks at those marks and decides if they are cause for concern. Because cancer is so infrequent in a healthy population, a radiologist will see about 2,000 computer marks that are inconsequential for every one that is a real cancer. And to the computer software, tiny flecks of calcium, which are hallmarks of D.C.I.S., are much easier to spot than invasive cancers.
That was a major reason Daniel McGillicuddy, one of Dr. Downey's patients, went there. He had decided, he said, that he just did not trust his local Long Island hospital, and he knew a doctor at Sloan-Kettering who could give him a reference to a thoracic surgeon. Mr. McGillicuddy, who is 72, developed bladder cancer about a decade ago and was treated near his Oyster Bay home. Then he found out he had lung cancer. ''I wasn't staying locally,'' he said. ''I had had a couple of bad experiences at the local hospital.'' One time, he said, he had a bad reaction to anesthesia with a colonoscopy and collapsed. After he returned home, he said, ''the gastroenterologist never called to find out if I was still alive.'' He went to Dr. Downey and never left. He developed two separate lung cancers, which Dr. Downey removed, and is surviving with just one lung, but doing well.
But now, some of the most fervent believers in the so-called off-pump operations are turning from it, saying the information just does not back up the theory. Yet converts to off-pump surgery and skeptics of it say the field faces a huge problem, one that is in a sense emblematic of modern medicine: the practice seemed to be reasonable and took hold before anyone could conduct a controlled randomized clinical trial on its merits. Now, doctors wonder how the can truth emerge. In this case, doctors and patients may find an answer in 2007, when the Department of Veterans Affairs is to complete a large study comparing surgery with a heart-lung machine to surgery without it. Meanwhile, doctors are deciding for themselves, often by seeing what they want to see in what most agree is inadequate data. Meanwhile, off-pump operations are growing increasingly popular. A national database at Duke University shows that the number of off-pump surgeries has doubled in the last few years and that more than a quarter of all bypass operations are now off-pump.
''If I'm desperate enough, I might give a triglidazone off label,'' he said, referring to a class of oral diabetes drugs that lower CRP levels. Dr. Nissen and his colleagues are starting a study comparing a triglidazone to glitizide, a diabetes drug that does not reduce CRP, in heart patients to see whether the triglidazone is more effective in slowing heart disease. And Dr. Ridker and his colleagues are studying healthy people with normal cholesterol levels and high CRP levels to see whether reducing CRP levels with a statin will prevent heart disease. Those are the sorts of studies that need to be done before doctors and patients leap to the conclusion that anything that lowers CRP must be good, Dr. Rader and others said. Dr. James Cleeman of the National Cholesterol Education Program at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said he would be careful about going beyond the data at hand. (He does not receive support or honorariums from any drug companies.)
''It's hard to think about getting old when you're young,'' Rachel added. ''But when you see your family members -- my grandpa died of lung cancer, my grandparents on both sides had cancer. So it's on my mind a lot of times.'' But still, the future is so distant it is almost unfathomable to her. ''I wonder what we're going to be like when we're old,'' she mused. Lives Plagued by Illness Scientists used to say that the reason people are living so long these days is that medicine is keeping them alive, though debilitated. But studies like one Dr. Fogel directs, using records of of Union Army veterans, have led many to rethink that notion. The study involves a random sample of about 50,000 Union Army veterans. Dr. Fogel compared those men, the first generation to reach age 65 in the 20th century, with people born more recently. The researchers focused on common diseases that are diagnosed in pretty much the same way now as they were in the last century. So they looked at ailments like arthritis, back pain and various kinds of heart disease that can be detected by listening to the heart.
''I've never, ever, had any family member come and talk to me about that,'' Dr. Stewart said. But, he added, ''now they will.''
Men who had respiratory infections or measles tended to develop chronic lung disease decades later. Malaria often led to arthritis. Men who survived rheumatic fever later developed diseased heart valves. And stressful occupations added to the burden on the body. People would work until they died or were so disabled that they could not continue, Dr. Fogel said. ''In 1890, nearly everyone died on the job, and if they lived long enough not to die on the job, the average age of retirement was 85,'' he said. Now the average age is 62. A century ago, most people were farmers, laborers or artisans who were exposed constantly to dust and fumes, Dr. Costa said. ''I think there is just this long-term scarring.'' Searching for Answers Dr. Barker of Oregon Health and Science University is intrigued by the puzzle of who gets what illness, and when. ''Why do some people get heart disease and strokes and others don't?'' he said. ''It's very clear that current ideas about adult lifestyles go only a small way toward explaining this. You can say that it's genes if you want to cease thinking about it. Or you can say, When do people become vulnerable during development? Once you have that thought, it opens up a whole new world.''
But most of the added chemicals are useless, Dr. Kligman said. The doses are tiny -- ''homeopathic,'' in many cases -- and the chemicals, when they are used in a cosmetic formulation, are often unstable. Vitamin A, for example, breaks down almost instantly in a cream. ''You make it up, and two days later you have half of what you put in. Two months later, you ain't got nothing,'' Dr. Kligman said. Nonetheless, many cosmetics, regardless of vitamins, minerals and herbs, can give that glow of youth. Hair color can make gray disappear. Cosmetic dentistry promises shiny white teeth. Plastic surgery claims to wipe years from your face. And now, with even bifocal contact lenses, maybe we do have a chance to look healthier. (Read ''more beautiful.'') Yet, if the evolutionary biology hypothesis has but a germ of truth, and if we have radar for signs of health, are we purposely flying below the radar screen when we take advantage of the plethora of products to make us look youthful and beautiful?
The University Radiology Group in New Brunswick, N.J., began advertising its $295 test on the radio and in newspapers in December, drawing 200 patients. ''We already had the scanner, so it was not a big deal,'' said Dr. Judith Korek Amorosa, a radiologist there. The Arizona Heart Institute in Phoenix began advertising its $500 test in December, bringing in 300 people so far, said Jeannie Swindle,  the vice president for marketing there. The institute even offers specials, such as the one it had in May, when it reduced its price by more than $100, Ms. Swindle said. Many who had the lung scans were delighted. Kenneth MacWilliams, a 63-year-old investment banker in Dumont, N.J., went to Dr. Henschke's office for a test last year because he had breathed other peoples' smoke  at work. His scan showed no signs of tumors. ''There is absolutely no downside for me,'' Mr. MacWilliams said. ''Why would I not want to do this?''
''There is a lot of controversy as to why,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone thinks it has to do with the skill of the surgeon doing the original operation.'' Instead, Dr. Birkmeyer explained, the key may be the tumor board, a group of medical specialists who review each patient's proposed treatment program. At medical centers that see large numbers of patients, the tumor boards, he said, ''may be better at matching patients with therapies.'' ''The totality of evidence leaves little doubt that for most serious cancers, you improve your outlook by going to an experienced center,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. Yet, Dr. Downey said, most of his patients do not ask about such things. ''And when they do, they're apologetic,'' he said. Instead, they tell him they went to Memorial Sloan-Kettering because a local doctor told them to, or because they know someone who was treated there and did well. The most common reason, though, is the hospital's famous name. ''As soon as they hear the word 'cancer,' they head for Memorial,'' Dr. Downey said.
''There is no guarantee that we would get any stem cells from those 200 frozen embryos,'' Dr. Gibbons said. ''We hear all this stuff about how all these embryos are available,'' he added. ''But we just didn't think there was much there.'' Dr. Gibbons said it was the dire lack of frozen embryos available for research that led his group to make its own, a controversial experiment the Jones Institute reported last month. Even then, only 3 out of 110 embryos yielded stem cells. The embryos were ideal, made from the eggs and sperm of young and healthy volunteers and never frozen. The frozen embryos at fertility centers are much less robust, medical experts say. Dr. Pool said that until recently, he and others froze many embryos that were of poor quality and would never grow. And, he added, they put them in solutions that were not optimal, so even healthy embryos frozen in previous years may not grow into blastocysts.
One of the most persistent was Dr. Howard Champion, a retired trauma surgeon from the Washington Hospital Center. He had been frustrated by the slow pace of research in trauma and had started an advocacy group to try to encourage financing and research by the National Institutes of Health. But little had happened. The military, he said, supported the development of substances that might help in trauma, like a lightweight salt solution to restore fluids to injured soldiers, but it was never tested in the large clinical trials that are necessary before it can be sold. ''They couldn't get anyone to test it, and they couldn't test it themselves,'' Dr. Champion said. The standard salt solution, Ringer's solution, was developed at least 50 years ago to treat diarrhea. ''The standard of care is 1,000 c.c.'s of Ringer's, and if that doesn't work, give another 1,000 c.c.'s,'' Dr. Champion said. Each 1,000 cubic centimeter package weighs about 2.2 pounds. ''That's quite a lot of weight when you're running up a hill under gunfire,'' he said. A friend told him that in the Falkland Islands war, he could always tell where troops had been running from gunfire, he said. ''Those who were carrying those 1,000-c.c. bags of Ringer's jettisoned them. You could see the glistening bags among the grasses.''
Now he is analyzing the fly genes that make it possible, finding that only about 100 of the 14,000 fruit fly genes are involved. Three to 8 of the 100 genes are most important, Dr. Rose said, and he has identified two of them, both common genes that are found in humans. One instructs cells to make superoxide dismutase, proteins that ''take charged molecules that cut through DNA and RNA like buzz saws and turn them to water.'' He will not reveal the identity of the other gene because he has applied for a patent on it. The final piece of the new aging evidence comes from studies with mice, said Dr. Richard A. Miller, a pathology professor at the University of Michigan School of Medicine and associate director of the university's geriatrics center. Scientists long ago discovered two mouse strains that were interesting because they were small. Recently, Dr. Andrzej Bartke at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale asked how long the mice lived and found that they lived 50 to 75 percent longer than normal. They are ''fat little mice,'' Dr. Miller said, but they are not entirely normal. The gene mutations knock out cells of their pituitary glands, preventing the animals from making hormones like growth hormone, thyroid hormone and prolactin. These dwarf mice grow to just one-third the normal size.
Some radiologists say full-body scans can be so profitable that it is almost irresistible to offer them. With patients paying out of pocket, there are no insurance companies to haggle with. ''They make money, big time,'' said Dr. E. Stephen Amis Jr., vice chairman of the board of chancellors of the American College of Radiology. ''People see an opportunity here and they grab it.'' The six mobile units from CAT Scan 2000 are each staffed by a technologist who runs the scanner and a receptionist who takes the cash payments in advance. The units stop for a day at each place, arriving at small towns and cities in the South, Southwest, and Midwest, usually setting up in church parking lots. (The pastor gets a coupon for two free scans.) Radiologists at the company headquarters in Clearwater, Fla., read the scans and mail reports to clients in a few weeks. Gina Johnson, the company's chief executive, says arguments against early detection for its own sake ''do not make common sense to a layperson.''
And even if the demand for colonoscopies starts to slacken, Dr. Rex said, gastroenterologists still have plenty of alternatives. ''We have a lot of organs,'' Dr. Rex said. ''The esophagus, the stomach, the small bowel, the liver, the pancreas. I think we've got a lot to do.'' Gastroenterologists, he added, ''will still be able to make a comfortable living.'' PROSPECTS
Although muscle strength and size seem to go together, Dr. Hoffman says they are independent -- some people can gain muscle size but not much strength; others can gain strength but not much size. Some gain both. Others gain neither. But while the study is supported by the National Institutes of Health, which is interested in preventing and treating disease, the investigators are also very aware that their results may be used outside the medical arena. For example, they ask, when the genetic variants, are found, should there be testing for those who want to know their athletic potential? Would people suffer psychological harm if they learned that they were genetically incapable of benefiting from physical training? To find out, Erynn Gordon, a genetic counselor in Dr. Hoffman's group, said the researchers were assessing how participants reacted to learning their genetic destinies. The subjects took a psychological test, a self-concept assessment, before the research began. When the study is completed, they will be informed of their genetic profiles and will retake the psychological test, allowing the investigators to compare their self images before and after getting the news.
As for the obese themselves, a big question is not whether they tend to have higher blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels or a greater incidence of diabetes -- they do -- but whether losing weight will cure them. Researchers disagree, in part because so few people lose weight and keep it off that it is difficult to know what would happen if they did. One of the few long-term studies was a 10-year look in Sweden at about 1,200 people weighing more than 250 pounds on average. Half had stomach-reducing bariatric surgery and the rest tried, unsuccessfully, to lose weight on their own. The surgery patients lost substantial weight and kept most of it off. And they ended up with fewer cases of diabetes. But the weight loss helped only briefly with their blood pressure and cholesterol levels, which initially fell but then drifted back to and then above their pre-surgery levels.
Then he did some research and found out that the scientists were wrong on all counts. The more he studied the drugs, the more he found himself confirming the street wisdom and not the medical textbooks. ''I must say I am humbled,'' Dr. Bhasin said. Now, he said, he has learned not just that testosterone works, but how. It appears to act on immature cells that could develop into either fat cells or muscle cells. Under the influence of testosterone, they choose the path leading to muscle. Testosterone also produces characteristic body changes, Dr. Pope said, with the most marked muscle growth in the upper body and the biceps. Dr. Pope has published photographs of men who did not use anabolic steroids and grew as big as possible without them, and of men who used them. His goal, he says, is to show what a steroid-enhanced body looks like as a way to discourage use of the drug.
A new Air Force report raising questions about whether the defoliant Agent Orange might be linked to diabetes in Vietnam veterans is as puzzling as it is provocative. The study compared the health of 859 veterans of Operation Ranch Hand, who flew planes that sprayed the defoliant Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, to that of 1,232 who did not spray the chemical. There was no difference in the incidence of diabetes in the two groups -- 16.9 percent of the Ranch Hand group was diabetic and 17 percent of the control group was diabetic. The diabetes effect only showed up when scientists looked at the levels of dioxin, the main chemical in Agent Orange, in the men's blood. After adjusting for factors like age and body fat levels, they concluded that the Ranch Hand participants with the lowest levels of dioxin in their blood had a 47 percent lower risk of diabetes than those with the highest levels of dioxin in their blood.
As professional medical and dental societies formulate guidelines, scientists say that what they really need are some good studies, which are only about to begin, as to what advice is helpful. Drug holidays, for example. Should cancer patients stop taking bisphosphonates for a year or so and then start again? Should osteoporosis patients stop periodically? ''The pharmaceutical industry has every desire that a patient who starts on a bisphosphonate would take it for life,'' said Dr. Robert Gagel of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. ''The bone community, of which I am a member, has always been a bit suspicious of that viewpoint.'' Some patients say they are left unsure of the medical advice they have already been given. Joan McDevitt, 53, of Franklin, Me., took steroids for an eye problem, a treatment that may increase the risk of osteonecrosis. Then, with low bone density, she began taking an oral bisphosphonate. A year and a half later, this February, she had an infected tooth extracted. The hole would not heal, and pieces of bone from her jaw kept splintering and coming out.
Members of an expert committee of scientists that assessed the safety of silicone breast implants formally issued their report today, calling for more research on risks of rupture and other local complications that can arise from the devices. Although there is no scientific evidence pointing to silicone implants as the cause of major diseases, the scientists said, women who have breast implants, whether they are filled with silicone or salt water, have the right to know what the chances are that the devices will slip or deflate or lead to infections or scarring. The committee was established by the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences in response to a request by Congress in 1997. Its members had no connection to companies that manufacture implants or to lawyers representing women suing the companies and had taken no prior positions on the safety of silicone breast implants, said Dr. Kenneth Shine, the president of the Institute of Medicine.
''There is a lot of controversy as to why,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone thinks it has to do with the skill of the surgeon doing the original operation.'' Instead, Dr. Birkmeyer explained, the key may be the tumor board, a group of medical specialists who review each patient's proposed treatment program. At medical centers that see large numbers of patients, the tumor boards, he said, ''may be better at matching patients with therapies.'' ''The totality of evidence leaves little doubt that for most serious cancers, you improve your outlook by going to an experienced center,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. Yet, Dr. Downey said, most of his patients do not ask about such things. ''And when they do, they're apologetic,'' he said. Instead, they tell him they went to Memorial Sloan-Kettering because a local doctor told them to, or because they know someone who was treated there and did well. The most common reason, though, is the hospital's famous name. ''As soon as they hear the word 'cancer,' they head for Memorial,'' Dr. Downey said.
The surgery took place in Colorado and the patients were evaluated in New York. The fetal cell surgery involved drilling four small holes in the patient's forehead and then inserting long needles through the holes into the brain and injecting fetal cells. The sham surgery involved drilling the holes but not injecting needles into the brain. After a year, the patients were told whether they had the fetal cell surgery and, if not, they were offered it if they wanted it. The study's primary measure of success was whether the patients themselves noticed that they were better, as determined by a survey that they mailed in a year later but before they knew whether they had had fetal cell implants or a sham operation. The study found no difference between the two groups -- neither those who had had the fetal cell operation nor those who had had the sham surgery noticed an improvement in their symptoms.
''We were not making it, we were just getting killed,'' Ms. Allen said. ''There was one week when we did just eight patients. We owned the building, we were paying peoples' salaries and we were really scared.'' The only way to survive, Ms. Allen decided, was to meet her competitor's fee and forgo her own pay. The competing clinic finally raised its fee to $230 for a first-trimester abortion, and so Ms. Allen and Ms. Miller did the same. Their clinic now does about 1,200 abortions a year. Ms. Allen and Ms. Miller still have to watch every penny. Like other clinics, the owners save money by training a low-paid staff to do everything but the actual surgery, from drawing blood to doing lab tests. Most of the time, no patients are scheduled and the staff cleans and does paper work. But when the doctor comes, a parade of patients is ready for the procedure, which takes just two or three minutes in the first trimester of pregnancy.
Statins are expensive, however. Even one of the cheapest, Merck &amp; Company's lovastatin, costs $2.01 a day wholesale, said Marc Boston, a Merck spokesman. Lovastatin's patent is due to expire on June 15, however, paving the way for less costly generic forms. But heart disease experts say the benefits of putting more Americans on the drugs are well worth the price. ''These statins are amazing drugs,'' said Dr. Scott M. Grundy, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and chairman of the panel that wrote the new cholesterol guidelines. ''When you say you can't put that many people on drugs, you've got to balance that against the tremendous devastation of coronary heart disease,'' Dr. Grundy added.
A widespread belief about the onset of puberty in girls is coming under vigorous attack, led by a group of medical specialists who say that it is based on flawed science and that it can have dire medical consequences. The belief -- that girls are now starting puberty as early as age 6 or 7 -- began with a single study that critics say has serious problems. The study led some experts to suggest changes in the guidelines used by pediatricians in deciding whether girls whose puberty starts early need to be evaluated by specialists to look for medical problems that might be the cause. And it has led parents and social scientists to cast about for explanations. They have attributed the change to such things as plastics in the environment or hormones in food or the influence of explicitly sexual television shows on the development of girls' brains. But some pediatric endocrinologists are now trying to stop the bandwagon.
That was a major reason Daniel McGillicuddy, one of Dr. Downey's patients, went there. He had decided, he said, that he just did not trust his local Long Island hospital, and he knew a doctor at Sloan-Kettering who could give him a reference to a thoracic surgeon. Mr. McGillicuddy, who is 72, developed bladder cancer about a decade ago and was treated near his Oyster Bay home. Then he found out he had lung cancer. ''I wasn't staying locally,'' he said. ''I had had a couple of bad experiences at the local hospital.'' One time, he said, he had a bad reaction to anesthesia with a colonoscopy and collapsed. After he returned home, he said, ''the gastroenterologist never called to find out if I was still alive.'' He went to Dr. Downey and never left. He developed two separate lung cancers, which Dr. Downey removed, and is surviving with just one lung, but doing well.
The HealthView Web site quoted Whoopi Goldberg (''The most comprehensive health exam that exists. I love them.'') and William Shatner (''I'm sending everyone I know.''). And the site told how the concept worked: a person could call and make an appointment and have a simple 15-minute scan, while lying fully clothed on a table. The powerful X-ray scanner could look inside the entire body, ''from the neck to the pelvis,'' the advertisements said. ''Almost all diseases uncovered at asymptomatic stages can be modified, reversed, or cured,'' HealthView promised. Those whose scans found nothing amiss could have peace of mind. Soon, competitors opened their own center, CT Screening International, just across the street. Dr. Michael Brant-Zawadzki, a radiologist who was medical director there, remembers those heady days after the center opened in 2001. ''The place was jammed,'' Dr. Brant-Zawadzki said. ''We had a waiting list, and we were competing with the poster boy of whole body scanning.''
On the other hand, Dr. Applebaum said her group did not like Dr. McClellan's plans for preventing terrorism directed at the food supply. The agency did a threat assessment, which is classified, and took action, announcing that it would require better record-keeping and greater authority to examine food and to detain it at national boundaries and state lines when it presents an imminent hazard to humans or animals. ''What surprises me is that before this the F.D.A. didn't have this clear authority,'' Dr. McClellan said. ''We're in a new world and we have to adapt.'' Dr. Applebaum said the F.D.A. had gone too far. ''We just think they overextended what they need as it related to enhancing what is necessary for the security of our food supply,'' she said. The proposed regulations, she added, are unnecessarily burdensome. For Dr. McClellan -- who travels between his offices in Washington and Rockville, Md., attending meetings, reading stacks of documents, and replying to e-mail messages -- the daunting task is just keeping up. He gets to work around 8 a.m. and usually returns to his home in Northwest Washington by about 7 or 7:30 p.m., spending time with his 4-year-old twin daughters before they go to bed. His Blackberry, a wireless device that lets him get messages instantly, is on until he goes to sleep. His wife, Stephanie, he adds, used to choose vacation spots in places where there was no cellphone service; now she looks for places where he can't use his Blackberry.
Feeling tired for 11 days. A cardiologist she called that morning had gone home for Christmas. Did not want to bother him. At lunch with her daughter, ''I started to feel much worse. I had no pains, more of a weakness, and I felt dizzy.'' Lay down on a bench. ''I said, 'It's just the drink, that's all it is.''' Four hours later, at a movie, Ms. Atrubin felt nauseous. Leaving restroom, she thought, ''If I don't lie down I'm going to fall down.'' Daughter saw her lying on theater floor, called 911. At the hospital, her arteries are opened with a clot-dissolving drug, streptokinase. Hospitalization from Dec. 24-Dec. 30, 1992. Two days in intensive care, two in intermediate care. Treatment includes: routine blood tests, electrocardiograms, streptokinase and discharge medications, including two to lower blood pressure and aspirin. 1997  SECOND HEART ATTACK  OCT. 29, AGE 67  CHARGES SUBMITTED TO INSURANCE, IN 2007 DOLLARS $43,747.66
Fifty years ago, when he was 19, Edward J. Woodland Jr. joined the Air Force. In Wyoming for basic training, he and some of his fellow recruits gave blood samples for a study of strep throat. Mr. Woodland, a retired security guard who lives in Washington, had long since forgotten about that study. But he heard of it again in February when he got a three-page letter from a government scientist whose group had found the blood samples in a freezer in Minneapolis, tested them for something entirely unrelated and tracked him down after all these years. The hope was that Mr. Woodland might provide vital clues to an abiding medical mystery: what is the natural course of hepatitis C? Some hepatitis specialists say the virus is usually not very worrisome. Others say that it is a terrifying national epidemic and that everyone who is infected should be found and treated. But the treatment is expensive, unpleasant and not very effective, so medical experts feel an urgent need to discover just how bad the disease is. Mr. Woodland and others in the study may help them find out.
Uprima is actually a new formulation of an old drug, apomorphine, that increases levels of the brain chemical dopamine. Such drugs are well known because they are used to treat Parkinson's disease, a degenerative condition that occurs when dopamine-producing cells in one area of the brain mysteriously start to die. Dr. C. Warren Olanow, a Parkinson's disease expert who is a professor and chairman of the department of neurology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said that men with Parkinson's disease often suffered from erectile dysfunction. ''Parkinson's disease causes a loss of potency very early in the course of the disease,'' he said. ''People will tell you that they have a loss of potency long before they have any other symptom.'' Practically as soon as the first drug to treat Parkinson's disease, L-dopa, was discovered in 1967, doctors realized that some patients who used it had erections as a side effect. There even was was a commercial pornographic movie called ''El Dopa,'' Dr. Olanow said. But among doctors, the effect was treated more as a sly joke than as a clue to solving a problem affecting millions of men.
''Although that is higher than I would like, it is not the doomsday scenario that many people would have you believe,'' said Dr. Scott Spear, a consultant to Inamed and a plastic surgeon at Georgetown University. He said that the most common device-related complication that led to additional operations was contracture, the formation of painful scar tissue that forms over an implant. Dr. Spear said that over two years, 7 percent of women who had implants for augmentation and about 15 percent of women who had them for breast reconstruction needed more surgery for this reason. But, he said, government-approved saline-filled breast implants also elicit contracture, and at the same rate. With any plastic surgery, Dr. Spear said, it is common for patients to have operations to improve or repair the original procedures. For example, he said, 20 percent of patients who had nose reconstruction had additional surgery. ''Some members expressed concern that 20 percent of augmentation patients and 45 percent of reconstruction patients have re-operations,'' Dr. Spear said. ''Re-operation and revision is part of what distinguishes plastic surgery from other fields of surgery.''
His surgeon told him that they would have to collapse his lung and take out a piece. ''He said, 'This is not trivial. You're going to be sick and have a lot of pain,' '' Dr. Casarella said. ''I said, 'Not me. I'm tough. I'll pop right up.' Of course, he was right.'' It took eight weeks, Dr. Casarella said, before he felt normal again, and the bill for the surgery and the hospital stay was $47,000. His insurance paid, but, Dr. Casarella said, ''it doesn't matter who pays -- it's a lot of money.'' The lung nodules turned out to be scars from an old histoplasmosis infection, a common fungal disease that is of no consequence in healthy people. That also explained his liver nodules, Dr. Casarella said. If he had had a total body scan, it would not have been able to rule out colon cancer because patients have to be prepped for that, with their colons voided of stool and filled with carbon dioxide. The colon exam also has to be done twice, once with the person face down and once face up.
About 100 years ago, when physicians were at a very critical historical moment and they realized that their treatments were relatively ineffective, prognosis had incredible salience. Patients came to doctors and doctors cultivated the ability to predict what would happen. But as doctors acquired more effective treatments, the impetus to prognosticate declined. There is this presumption that disease will be treated and eliminated. So why bother to predict what will happen? The disease is going to get better because doctors are so powerful and so knowledgeable and so effective.  Q. What is wrong with doctors' emphasizing diagnosis and treatment and ignoring prognosis?  A. Doctors can become so interested in treating conditions that they can lose sight of the fact that the treatments don't have uniform outcomes and in many cases the treatments are not as effective as is supposed. A lack of attention to prognostication can result in patients' dying badly. For instance, 40 to 70 percent of Americans die in pain, 80 percent die in institutions rather than at home as many prefer, 60 percent of Americans have significant suffering when they die.
CAT Scan 2000, a Florida company with mobile units that travel the nation's two-lane highways, stopping at places like the North Park Church of Christ here, charges $199 to scan any of three regions of the body, or $567 for all three. It proudly calls itself the Wal-Mart of scanning. But the growing popularity of these scans raises a conundrum of modern medicine: does a test that can spot such abnormalities actually guard against disease? A rising chorus of experts and official groups advise people to save their money. They say that under close enough scrutiny, almost everyone will have some abnormality. But do these imperfections constitute a threat to health, and will treatment make a difference? ''We've sold ourselves the myth that getting everything early is always good,'' said Dr. Larry Kessler, the director of the office of surveillance and biometrics at the Food and Drug Administration. But now, he said, with scanners that can find lumps smaller than a millimeter, or four-hundredths of an inch, what does early detection mean?
But, Dr. Winer said, over the past couple of years ''that question has been reopened in a major way.'' The new study, he added, is part of the re-examination. The study analyzed data from three large clinical trials that tested different chemotherapy regimens. One gave two standard drugs with or without a third drug, paclitaxel. Another compared drugs in low, moderate or high doses, and the third asked whether it was better to give the drugs more intensely, in two-week cycles, or whether three-week cycles were best. The women also had surgery and radiation as appropriate, but the studies focused on the effects of chemotherapy. The analysis, by a group of leading breast cancer researchers, led by Donald Berry, a statistician at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, asked whether some women were more likely to benefit from chemotherapy. The conclusion was that even though the studies involved very different chemotherapy regimens, one variable always stood out: whether a woman's cancer was estrogen receptor positive, meaning it was fed by estrogen, or estrogen receptor negative, meaning it was impervious to estrogen's effects.
Researchers have found a genetic signature in breast tumors that seems to be a powerful predictor of whether the cancer will spread and kill or whether it can easily be cured by surgery, causing no further harm. The research involved relatively few patients, all relatively young, and its conclusions remain to be confirmed by further studies. But scientists said the genetic signature -- the activity of a collection of 70 genes -- appears to predict cancer mortality better than traditional measures like tumor size or stage or whether the cancer has spread to a woman's underarm lymph nodes. In the study, 5.5 percent of women whose cancers had a good genetic signature died within the next decade, as against 45 percent of those with bad genetic signatures. It will be at least several years before the work could change medical practice. But the findings, by researchers in Amsterdam, are raising questions about the nature of cancer, its treatment and the benefits of early detection. The current study did not address questions about how to treat tumors. Questions about what to do when cancers have bad genetic signatures will have to be dealt with in future studies.
Dr. McClellan said that women should consult with their doctors about whether to take estrogen for the symptoms of menopause. But, he said, ''estrogen and progestin should be used at the lowest doses for the shortest time.'' The agency has also revised two of the three indications for the use of estrogen. The drugs were suggested for vaginal dryness and irritation, even if there were no symptoms and the condition was noticed only in a medical exam. Now, the drugs' labels will state that the condition must be moderate to severe and that women should consider using topical products, like vaginal creams. Although estrogen can slow bone loss that occurs with menopause, the new drug labels must state that when the hormone is used only for prevention of osteoporosis, it should be restricted to women who are of the highest risk. Even then, the new labels will say, other osteoporosis drugs that do not contain estrogen should be considered.
Beyond those sites, however, experts say there are guidelines and even Web sites that can help individuals decide whether to trust an electronic site. The American Medical Association suggests checking the source of the information and the financing for the site in judging its reliability. Warning signs include sites that seem to be promoting products or that offer miraculous treatments or cures. The association also says to check how often the information is updated and who reviews it. Other advice comes from Dr. Ragnar Levi of the Swedish Council on Technology Assessment in Health Care, who recently analyzed the problem of determining the quality of information on Web sites. Writing in the current issue of the magazine Skeptical Inquirer, Dr. Levi notes that a Web site by the Health on the Net Foundation, a nonprofit group in Geneva, http://www.hon.ch/HONcode/ HONcodecheck.html, provides a checklist of questions that can help people assess a site's credibility.
But when Ms. Buchanan received a diagnosis of breast cancer a few years ago, she stayed with the local doctor who found her tumor, Dr. Rachel P. Dultz, at University Medical Center, a community hospital in Princeton, N.J. She just had a good, warm feeling about Dr. Dultz, she said, and could not imagine that she would receive better care from anyone else. ''If I went to a Sloan-Kettering, I'm sure there are fabulous people there, but you've got to have total confidence in the person who's going to be taking care of you,'' Ms. Buchanan said. Patsy Brandt of Cherry Hill, N.J., came to the opposite conclusion. She went to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, and never investigated any other options for her breast cancer treatment. ''It's sort of a no-brainer when one lives in a doable radius of a major teaching and research hospital,'' Mrs. Brandt said.
When she ran the same advertisement in October, without mentioning the price the couple would pay, Ms. Pinkerton said, she got only six responses. Until now, ethicists argued whether $5,000 was too much to pay for an egg donor. They debated whether it was coercive for couples to ask for S.A.T. scores or height or favorite books when they sought egg donors. But, some ethicists say, a $50,000 price, in a donor market that just a year ago was reeling from offers of $7,500 for donors, makes them wonder whether the business is getting out of control. The couple offering $50,000 wants to remain anonymous, Ms. Pinkerton said. But, she said, they decided to offer $50,000 ''because they can.'' The couple also realized that it might be hard to find a donor who met their criteria. They are ''highly educated,'' Ms. Pinkerton said, and want a child who can be highly educated as well. They are tall, so they want a child who is tall.
Xolair and, if it is marketed, TNX-901 will be expensive. Manufacturing is difficult and costly, said Dr. Hal Barron, vice president of medical affairs at Genentech. Medical experts said that the medication would cost more than $10,000 a year and that if a drug was approved for asthma, insurers were unlikely to pay for it for peanut allergies. Dr. John Barron, who directs the asthma, sinus and allergy program at Vanderbilt University, said he would offer it to patients anyway. Besides, Dr. Barron said, many people with peanut allergies also have asthma. Then, he said, ''you can skirt the system.'' The TNX-901 study is the first sign that there can be a solution for people who live in constant fear of peanuts. The trepidation is so great that many fear that they will react if they even smell the legume. But Dr. Hugh A. Sampson of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, a principal investigator in the new study, said that did not occur. Dr. Sampson put highly allergic people in a room that smelled of peanuts.
For example, study after study found that people whose diets were high in beta carotene had a lower incidence of lung cancer. But in studies in which smokers and former smokers took beta carotene supplements, it turned out that the vitamin actually increased lung cancer risk and lung cancer deaths. Studies found associations between high-fiber diets and reduced incidence of colon cancer. But a large study that randomly assigned some subjects to high-fiber diets found no reduction in cancer or in polyps, the growths that can precede cancer. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering, Dr. Shike said, patients are taught how to eat healthy diets and even go over their diets food by food with a nutritionist and a computer program, but are not told that diets are a panacea. ''We are not saying you can prevent cancer with a healthy diet, but we say a healthy diet and a healthy weight are part of a healthy lifestyle, which can help lower your risk.''
PROSPECTS
AS any woman who has ventured into a health club knows, the weight-lifting area is very much a male domain. The rubber-surfaced nonslip floor where the barbells and dumbbells reside is dominated by hefty men, grunting and groaning as they pump iron. Most women steer clear, clustering instead in the group exercise classes, taking yoga or step aerobics. And that, medical experts say, can be a mistake, at least for women who want to reshape their bodies. While cardiovascular exercise like running can help the heart and burn calories, the best way for women to change their look is to lift weights -- heavy weights. ''To really reshape yourself, you have to hypertrophy muscles,'' said Dr. William J. Kraemer, a professor of kinesiology at the University of Connecticut, referring to the medical term for muscle growth. Dr. Kraemer was the principal author of a new position paper on weight lifting for the American College of Sports Medicine and is the editor of a leading research journal on weight lifting, The Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research.
Few expect that the paper published last week will automatically convert true believers. It may take more research, and more skepticism even of the skeptics, before the dust finally settles. Dr. McDonald said he wrote a paper 18 years ago that concluded that the placebo effect did not exist. But, he said, the New England Journal of Medicine rejected the manuscript, saying that everyone knew the effect existed. The paper was eventually published, in Statistics in Medicine. But he met with such disbelief that he gave up even talking about his findings. ''It wasn't the right time,'' he said. ''But the good thing about science is that sooner or later the truth comes out.''
''African primates all carry their own little viruses,'' said Dr. Jonathan S. Allan, a virologist at the Southwestern Foundation for Biomedical Research in San Antonio. ''In some species, the viruses have been there for thousands of years. And the natural host never gets sick.'' With this background, the challenge for Dr. Hahn and Dr. Shaw was to find a way to look for AIDS-like viruses in wild chimpanzees, which are a protected and endangered species. It is illegal to capture them or even to anesthetize them and take their blood. The investigators discovered that they could find identifying traces of the virus in feces and urine. They tested their methods, first with human feces and urine and then with feces and urine from chimpanzees in captivity. (Dr. Hahn said her students rebelled after testing human feces, saying they would not spend months working with such material. But chimpanzee feces, she added, turned out not to have an objectionable odor.)
Say you do find a cluster. Unless you identify, say, black lung or mesothelioma, statisticians say, the next question is: How can you decide if the cluster was caused by blind random clumpings of cases, with no environmental cause, or by a toxin in the environment? Why would only one town have a disease cluster, some experts ask, while other places with the same pollutants in the air or water do not? One possibility might be an unidentified chemical in a mix of pollutants that is unique to the town. But that, of course, raises questions of how to find it. Finally, there is the indirect exposure problem. If there is no direct link between chemicals and a disease, the tendency is to look for other exposures. Could the fathers, for example, have had their sperm affected when they were growing up? Or could the mothers have been exposed to chemicals during pregnancy? Some statisticians say that if people look hard enough and slice the data enough ways and an association will emerge. What it means is another question.
The finding was puzzling. There was no obvious reason that a protein that carried cholesterol in the blood should affect a disease that involved the accumulation of rough debris in the brain and the gradual death of brain cells. Yet the observation held. In study after study, apo E4 predisposed people to Alzheimer's. Then, a few years ago, Dr. Benjamin Wolozin, a professor of pharmacology at the Loyola University Medical School in Maywood, Ill., got what he thought was a brilliant idea. He was doing laboratory experiments, following up on a report that cholesterol changed the way beta amyloid, a protein thought to be the main contributor to plaque in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, was processed. It was pure laboratory research. ''From a medical standpoint, it was irrelevant,'' he said. Then Dr. Wolozin realized that a similar experiment was already under way. Millions of people were taking statins, which lowered cholesterol levels. Were they also less likely to develop Alzheimer's?
Dr. Monica Morrow, a professor of surgery at Northwestern University, said her national survey of women with early-stage breast cancer found that just 42.6 percent had breast-conserving surgery; the worse the woman's prognosis, the more likely she was to have a mastectomy instead. In an editorial accompanying the two studies, Dr. Morrow wrote that ''breast-conserving therapy is still not accepted as equivalent of mastectomy, but instead is viewed as a less aggressive therapy appropriate only for women with a good prognosis.'' She said she hoped the new results would change that view. Dr. Morrow's outlook was echoed by others. ''We have science here to back up the claim that even if a cancer makes you nervous as a doctor or a patient, you don't necessarily have to do a mastectomy, even if you have a gut feeling that you want to do it,'' said Dr. Barron Lerner, a historian and internist at Columbia University and author of ''The Breast Cancer Wars'' (Oxford University Press, 2001).
IT certainly is easy to get fat in the United States. Take the room service breakfast at the Marriott Hotel in Gaithersburg, Md. If you order a bagel and orange juice, what comes is two huge bagels, orange juice, a banana and strawberries -- a meal with at least 1,000 calories. Clearly, some people are succumbing to temptation. Last week, in a special issue devoted to obesity, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a litany of bad news. Americans are eating more than ever, increasing their average number of calories year by year. And the percentage of adults who claim they are physically inactive remained nearly flat from 1991 to 1998, at about 29 percent. The combination of more calories and little exercise yields a predictable result: Americans are getting fatter every year. More than half are now overweight and nearly 18 percent are obese -- more than 30 percent above ideal body weight, according to an official medical measure of fatness. (Overweight is defined as a body mass index of 25 to 29; obese is an index of at least 30. Your body mass index is 4.89 times your weight in pounds divided by your height in feet squared.)
Dr. Newman, for one, is optimistic. ''I think there will be less frailty and I think it will be delayed,'' she says. Overcoming Stereotypes At 79, Dr. Robert Butler, still works 60 hours a week. He is president and chief executive of the International Longevity Center, a research and education foundation in New York and a professor of geriatrics at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. He says he expects nothing less of himself, attributing his vigor in part to his luck in having excellent health and in part to something more subtle. He never bought into the pervasive stereotypes of old age. Dr. Butler noticed the problem when he was a medical student. He recalls the private names doctors had for the elderly like crock and old biddy. In the decades since, he says, attitudes among doctors and the general public have not really changed. And, he adds, the stereotypes have an effect. ''My experience with older people is that they certainly do get cowed by this,'' he said.
In one experiment after another, scientists will inactivate a gene in an inbred strain of mice to learn what occurs when it is missing. That tells them its function. Yet when they inactivate the same gene in a different strain of mice, they may see no effect or a different effect. The researchers find the same process in inbred yeast strains. Even a gene inactivation that kills the organisms of one strain may have no apparent effect in another strain. ''It's not that the gene is performing a different function,'' Dr. Hartwell said. ''It's that the genetic context is different.'' Dr. Michael M. Kaback, a geneticist at the University of California at San Diego, said a similar human case involved the gene for hemochromatosis, an iron storage disorder that can cause heart damage, diabetes, adrenal insufficiency and cirrhosis. It is easy to screen for the gene, and the treatment is simple, regularly removing a few units of a patient's blood. When the gene was discovered, some experts urged screening the entire population because treatment was simple and effective.
And moles may not be the only tumors like that. Some scientists now suspect that the same sort of phenomenon is happening inside the body as well, with tiny tumors heading off on the path to cancer and then halting forever. They usually go unnoticed because they are tiny, no one is looking for them, and they have no pigment, meaning they don't stand out like moles on the skin. ''I would bet my last penny that our bodies are riddled with these things,'' said Dr. David E. Fisher, the director of the melanoma program at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. It's an unnerving idea: a cell randomly gets a mutation in a gene that puts it on a path to cancer. As a result, the cell starts to divide. Then, just as suddenly, the whole process stops, and there is a little tumor whose cells may never divide again.
''There's no extra payment for doing the counseling,'' Dr. Tamarin said. But there also is an abundance of abortion clinics in Manhattan where women should be able to get the pill, he said. ''If a patient comes to me,'' he said, ''and says, 'Doctor, I'm really uncomfortable going anywhere else. I'm terrified. I trust you. Would you please provide the medical abortion?' I would certainly do it. But if there's 10 people around the corner who do it and I'm up to the gills in other things, then I might not go out of my way looking for more work.'' Doctors point to other obstacles as well. One is deciding how far along a pregnancy is, since mifepristone can be used only within the first seven weeks of pregnancy. Another involves making sure that the fetus is in the uterus and not in a fallopian tube. The way to check on an early pregnancy is with intravaginal ultrasound, a method widely available at abortion clinics, but not in most private doctors' offices. The Hope Medical Group for Women, an abortion clinic in Shreveport, La., spent $27,000 on a machine, said Robin Rothrock, the clinic's administrator. And even if a doctor bought one for mifepristone abortions, ''you've got the issue of making sure they know what they are doing,'' she said.
But there is no apparent medical benefit, Dr. Fisher said, adding, ''In our research, Medicare enrollees in high intensity regions have 2 to 5 percent higher mortality rates than similar patients in the more conservative regions of the country.'' Doctors say that Medicare's policies are guiding medical practice, with many making calculated decisions about whom to treat and how to care for them based on what Medicare covers, and how much it pays. ''The bottom line is that the stuff that reimburses well is easier to get done,'' Dr. Carl Rosenkrantz, a Boca Raton radiologist, said. Thomas A. Scully, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he knew the situation all too well. ''We have a system that does nothing to look at utilization,'' Mr. Scully said in a telephone interview. ''If you send in a bill and you are legitimate, we pay it.'' The effect shows up in the way doctors deal with office visits, for example. Medicare in Boca Raton pays $52.46 for a routine visit, in which a doctor sees a patient with no new problem. That is not enough, doctors say; it costs about $1,500 a day to run an office there, they explain. Payments in other states are different, adjusted for cost of living, but doctors say, and Mr. Scully agrees, that they are generally inadequate. Doctors who try to make a living seeing only Medicare patients for routine visits, he said, ''have a very rough time.''
Dr. Steven Petersen, a neurology professor at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, noted that not only was there no brain research to back up the statement, but there was also no logical reason to ban television for the very young. Why no television as compared to one hour or two hours of it? ''Couldn't your child watch a little bit of TV and also get lots of interactions with caregivers?'' Dr. Petersen asked. The academy's stance, ''is like saying that tons and tons of junk food is bad and so therefore kids should never have a hamburger.'' Dr. Marjorie Hogan, the lead author of the pediatric academy's report, agreed that there are no studies with young children showing actual brain changes occurring with television viewing. ''We extrapolated,'' Dr. Hogan said; the pediatricians used other research to infer that children's brains are harmed when they spend their time gazing at television screens instead of interacting with humans.
''When people have been asking about glucosamine and chondroitin, we tell them this is the most important study ever done,'' Dr. Klippel said. ''It has a very large number of patients and it is scientifically rigorous.'' Previous studies had methodological flaws, and their results were contradictory. A handful of publicly financed trials showed no effect, Dr. Felson and others said. Other studies, financed by supplement makers, ''were impressively positive,'' Dr. Felson said. Dr. Clegg said the new study, financed by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine and the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, arose after an expert panel in 1998 concluded that ''there is a real and urgent public health need to test these agents in a rigorous way.'' Glucosamine and chondroitin are substances found naturally in joints, leading some to suggest that they might be helpful for arthritis patients. Glucosamine is a modified sugar that is thought to play a role in the formation and repair of cartilage, and chondroitin is part of a large protein, proteoglycan, that provides elasticity to cartilage.
The incidence rate has increased, but that does not mean that mammography's possible downside outweighs the good it can do. ''Every time you are looking at an early intervention process, you are looking at overtreatment,'' Dr. Norton said. Screening does find some tiny cancers that may not become deadly. But it also finds tiny tumors that will become untreatable or that will require drastic surgery and large doses of chemotherapy if they are found later. ''In some situations, it may be that early diagnosis is important and in others it is not,'' Dr. Norton said. But until there is a way of sorting out which tiny tumor is dangerous or until treatment gets so good that it does not matter when a tumor is found, early diagnosis makes sense, he said. There has been a decline in later stage disease -- the cancers that have spread beyond the breast -- and although it is not as pronounced as the rise in early stage disease, it does indicate that mammography is finding cancers when they are more easily treated.
Reducing the levels of a certain protein secreted by the body may be as powerful a tool in slowing heart disease and preventing heart attacks and cardiac-related death as lowering cholesterol, two teams of researchers are reporting today. The studies, being published in The New England Journal of Medicine, provide the strongest evidence yet that the protein -- known as CRP, for C-reactive protein -- plays a role in heart disease. The participants were patients with severe heart disease who were taking high doses of statin drugs, which reduce both cholesterol and CRP. Lower CRP levels, the researchers found, were linked to a slower progression of atherosclerosis and fewer heart attacks and deaths. And this effect was independent of the effect of lowering cholesterol. ''What we now have is hard clinical evidence that reducing CRP is at least as important as lowering cholesterol,'' said Dr. Paul Ridker of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the lead author of one of the studies.
Dr. Martin agreed, saying: ''People have been carrying bottles of water with them. Some people actually get water intoxication syndrome. They feel lethargic from drinking too much. I worry about the sanity of those people.''
Dr. Schatten studied what he calls the ''molecular undressing'' of a sperm cell by an egg. Sperm cells keep their genetic material tamped down into a cramped space, held in place by at least two proteins that form a sheathlike structure over the sperm's head. Ordinarily, the egg removes one of these proteins as the sperm cell passes through the egg's outer membrane and takes off others as the sperm makes its way through the cytoplasm to the egg's nucleus. By the time the sperm cell arrives at its destination, its genetic material is freed and replication can begin. With ICSI, Dr. Schatten found, the sheathlike proteins remain in place far longer and then, when the first protein comes off, the sperm's genetic material starts to abruptly push its way out. The carefully choreographed disrobing of the sperm is disrupted. Dr. Schatten said he had preliminary evidence that the X chromosome is at the tip of the sperm's genetic material, indicating that it may be preferentially affected by the unusual way the sperm's chromosomes spill out into the egg.
There are limitations, noted Dr. Alan R. Tall, an H.D.L. researcher at Columbia University. The main problem is the study's small size. ''It's not a watertight case by any means. But I basically believe it,'' he said. ''I think it's exciting.'' He and others see it as a harbinger of what might become a new heart disease prevention strategy that might involve pills to raise H.D.L. Or perhaps the therapy will remain an infusion, reserved for shrinking plaque in severe cases. An infusion could have powerful effects, Dr. Rader said. ''You could use it like induction therapy with cancer, hit it real hard, shrink it as much as possible, and then use maintenance therapy to keep it from coming back,'' he noted. ''That's the idea and it's very attractive.'' Dr. Brewer sees it as a proof of principle. ''We've only decreased, roughly, thirty percent of heart attacks for people on statins,'' he said. ''Can we reduce it even further? Our goal would be to decrease it 95 percent, and that is one reason to pursue H.D.L therapy, and that is why the proof of principle is important.''
The problem crept up on them, doctors and hospital administrators say, after they began agreeing to slash their prices for health insurers in return for a steady flow of patients. Then they found themselves scrambling to maintain their cash flow. They found an answer with patients outside the managed care system, like those with fee-for-service plans in which the patients pay their own bills and are reimbursed by an insurance company. But the uninsured also are outside the system, and have no one to negotiate for them. So they end up charged the higher prices, too. Most patients paying the full fare  have no idea that their bill may be many times that of the people next to them in the doctor's waiting room. And, in interviews, many doctors said they did not offer patients information on pricing disparities, however much they might agonize over the inequities of the system.
That was a major reason Daniel McGillicuddy, one of Dr. Downey's patients, went there. He had decided, he said, that he just did not trust his local Long Island hospital, and he knew a doctor at Sloan-Kettering who could give him a reference to a thoracic surgeon. Mr. McGillicuddy, who is 72, developed bladder cancer about a decade ago and was treated near his Oyster Bay home. Then he found out he had lung cancer. ''I wasn't staying locally,'' he said. ''I had had a couple of bad experiences at the local hospital.'' One time, he said, he had a bad reaction to anesthesia with a colonoscopy and collapsed. After he returned home, he said, ''the gastroenterologist never called to find out if I was still alive.'' He went to Dr. Downey and never left. He developed two separate lung cancers, which Dr. Downey removed, and is surviving with just one lung, but doing well.
Wanting credit, the researchers published their work. But not wanting to advertise it to the world's marathon runners, they published it in a Swiss triathlon journal, Der Laufer, written in German. Food is another issue. A change in eating patterns can markedly improve performance, said Dan Benardot, a sports nutritionist at Georgia State. But getting athletes to change their eating habits is another story. In analyzing athletes' diets, Dr. Benardot and Dr. Martin found that the diets of some, like Ms. Kastor and Mr. Keflezighi, were nearly perfect, ''astounding,'' Dr. Benardot said. But, he said, ''most of the athletes have really severe energy deficits at different times of the day.'' They ''don't eat enough, and they don't drink enough,'' Dr. Benardot said. ''Their backup plan is to take supplements,'' which, he added, are not particularly useful. The typical pattern for athletes, Dr. Benardot found, is to eat a tiny breakfast, snack throughout the day and then, ''at the end of the day, oh, my God, they make up for it with a big meal.''
Dr. Eggan, though, is not after replacement cells. His goal in cloning is to understand what goes wrong in a disease like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or diabetes. Dr. Melton gave an example. Suppose he had stem cells that were exact matches of 50 patients with Parkinson's disease and directed them to grow in the laboratory into nerve cells of the type that die in the disease. He could then ask when, and why, the cells die. ''Do they all show a defect at the same stage? If so, that would mean there is a common cause, like a flat tire. Or maybe each one breaks down in a different way. Is there one way to get Parkinson's, or 50 ways?'' Dr. Melton asked. ''We could use that information to do drug screening,'' he added, possibly finding ways to prevent the nerve cell death. For now, though, the Harvard lab is becoming a supplier to the world of its own 17 lines of human embryonic stem cells, created without cloning, and made from 286 frozen embryos created by in vitro fertilization.
Yet, at a time when coverage by Medicare and other insurers may increase, the evidence suggests that few obese people can lose significant amounts of weight in the long term. And some obesity researchers are also questioning the fundamental idea that losing weight improves health. Are weight loss programs, they ask, unnecessary medicine? ''No one wants to hear this,'' Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University, said, ''but I would ask where the data are.'' None of the experts, however, are suggesting that people should abandon healthy eating habits and exercise, which have clear benefits. At the moment, Medicare will pay for surgery for obesity when patients suffer other problems associated the condition, like diabetes. Now, Medicare says it may decide to cover treatment for those who are simply obese, meaning their body mass index, a measure of body fat, is at least 30. The agency said that it would need to determine if obesity treatments help people lose weight and improve their health, adding that as yet it has no estimate on costs.
Over the last 15 years, scientists have steadily built a case that killer T-cells can hold the AIDS virus in check. They found that the cells could inhibit the AIDS virus in test tubes. Then they found that killer T-cells proliferated in infected monkeys and in humans at the same time as the AIDS virus replication was brought under control. They found that the strength of an infected individual's killer T-cell response predicted how much virus would be in the person's blood and how well the person would do clinically. And they found that in monkeys, when killer T-cells were obliterated, AIDS viruses ran rampant, never coming under any sort of control and quickly killing the animals. Encouraged by the body of evidence, Dr. Letvin and his colleagues began looking for ways to prime monkeys to make CD8 cells. The method that worked, they learned, was a DNA vaccine, some components of which were provided by Merck &amp; Company, the pharmaceutical business.
''That is why I call it 'everlasting security,' '' he said. Dr. Richard DeMillo, chief technology officer at Hewlett-Packard, said that what interested him about the scheme was that it ''reshuffles the policy deck.'' ''Normally,'' he explained, ''agencies put the burden of wiretapping on the carrier.'' A telephone company, for example, would have to allow an agency like the Federal Bureau of Investigation to listen in on coded material. But with this system, the agency would still have the burden of trying to capture the appropriate stream of random numbers, a task that would be technologically infeasible. Dr. Lipton also said the scheme could thwart law enforcement agencies. ''If I'm saying to you, 'Buy 1,000 shares of I.B.M., I'm sure it's going to go up,' '' he said, ''and if that was an insider trading situation, five years from now the F.B.I. could go after you.'' If the agency had the encrypted message in hand, it could demand the key to read it, he said. But, Dr. Lipton said, if the random numbers used to encode were used once and never stored, the agency would be hamstrung. ''It changes the ground rules,'' he said.
Medical experts said national guidelines were unlikely to be changed until additional studies found that more aggressive cholesterol lowering resulted in a reduced risk of heart attacks and death. The study assessed the progression of atherosclerosis using a tiny ultrasound camera that was threaded into coronary arteries, allowing researchers to look directly at the growth of plaque. Large studies are under way seeking to determine if more growth, as detected by the ultrasound camera, means more heart attacks and deaths, but many cardiologists predict that it does. ''The probability is very high,'' said Dr. Bryan Brewer, chief of the molecular diseases branch at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Researchers say they only recently came to understand how plaque in artery walls can kill. They used to think that the danger period was when the tumorlike plaque narrowed arteries. Now, said Dr. Peter Libby, the chief of cardiovascular medicine at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, they realize that the danger occurs long before that.
Other common medical conditions have not been systematically studied, but Dr. Lindenauer said he would not be surprised if the same held true -- community hospitals will be at least as good as major medical centers for ordinary illnesses. ''A colleague of mine drew an analogy to driving and the idea that you just need to be a good enough driver to avoid accidents,'' he said. Beyond that, he said, ''we don't really differentiate that much between great and good enough.'' The situation is different for more-complex matters like heart surgery and cancer care, researchers say. In such cases, where you go can matter -- a lot, depending on the condition. ''Not that I want to oversimplify to this degree, but for cardiovascular care, pick a very busy, high-volume surgeon,'' said Dr. John D. Birkmeyer, a professor of surgery at the University of Michigan who has analyzed Medicare data. ''For cancer care, focus on the hospital.''
Now, however, Medicare, which says the lack of electronic records is one of the biggest impediments to improving health care, has decided to step in. In an unprecedented move, it said it planned to announce that it would give doctors -- free of charge -- software to computerize their medical practices. An office with five doctors could save more than $100,000 by choosing the Medicare software rather than buying software from a private company, officials say. The program begins next month, and the software is a version of a well-proven electronic health record system, called Vista, that has been used for two decades by hospitals, doctors and clinics with the Department of Veterans Affairs. Medicare will also provide a list of companies that have been trained to install and maintain the system. Given Medicare's heft, the software giveaway could transform American medicine, said Dr. John Wasson, a Dartmouth Medical School health care researcher.
''My children and other children were so terrified,'' he said. ''They could not understand why there now  was so much hatred against Muslims and Arabs. They are telling us: 'We're Americans. We feel for those who died. Our hearts go out to them.' '' Imam Qazwini said he explained to his children that the hatred that some displayed toward Muslims ''is ignorance'' and that the people who committed the crimes ''are evil.''  Parents, he said, ''should keep poised and quiet, patient and cautious.'' Nora Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Archdiocese of New York, suggested talking to children about the love of God. ''We would tell them that you are loved and cared about, just as Mommy and Daddy love you,'' she said. The Catholic schools in New York were open, she said, because it was important for children to have as much normalcy in their lives as possible. ''It is a healing technique,'' Ms. Murphy said.
Some participants at the meeting warned that though it sounded logical that if cancers were detected very early, patients who would otherwise die would be cured, the history of lung cancer screening provided a cautionary tale. A few decades ago, it was widely believed that chest X-rays could save lives by finding lung cancers before people had symptoms. The American Cancer Society recommended that smokers have annual chest X-rays and doctors urged the tests upon their patients. But in 1971, the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., began a study of 9,211 smokers who were randomly assigned to have regular chest X-rays or not. The results were startling. Cancers were found earlier, but the men who were screened lived no longer than those who were not -- their cancers killed them at the same time, but they lived a longer time beforehand knowing that they had cancer and being treated for it. As a result, the cancer society withdrew its recommendation that people at high risk for lung cancer be screened with chest X-rays.
The danger, he said, is that when doctors use that formula to decide when to end a treadmill test, they can inadvertently mislead themselves and their patients. Some patients may be stopping too soon and others may seem to have a heart problem because they never can get to what is supposed to be their maximum rate. ''Some people are being pushed and others are not,'' Dr. Lauer said. ''In my view, that is unacceptable.'' Yet, Dr. Seals said, many doctors want some sort of guide for estimating maximum heart rates for treadmill tests. And many people who want to increase their fitness crave a general formula. So Dr. Seals and his colleagues decided to take another stab at finding an equation. In a study published in the March issue of The Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Dr. Seals and his colleagues devised a new formula: maximum heart rate equals 208 minus 0.7 times age. They used published studies involving 18,712 healthy people and data from 514 healthy people they recruited. Their formula gives much higher average maximum heart rates for older people, with the new and old heart rate curves starting to diverge at age 40.
''It's not a cure,'' said Jim, who still is infected with H.I.V. ''It's like God gave me a break.'' The Mystery  Experts Try to Find Virus's Hiding Place Just a few years ago, many AIDS experts thought they had the virus on the run. When they gave patients a combination of drugs, the AIDS drug cocktail, the number of viruses in the blood fell to levels so low that they were undetectable. ''There were proposals that it would be possible to eliminate the infection,'' said Dr. Robert Siliciano, an AIDS researcher at the Johns Hopkins medical school. ''It was hoped that eradication would be possible.'' Then reality set in. Dr. Martin Markowitz, the clinical director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York, told scientists at a recent AIDS meeting what happened when 14 patients stopped taking their AIDS drugs. They had begun taking drugs, on average, two months after the virus first entered their bodies -- much later than the patients in Dr. Walker's study -- and had taken the drugs for about three to six years. But, Dr. Markowitz said, as soon they stopped, the virus came roaring back.
While Dr. Taubenberger's analysis of that gene did not reveal any such  nefarious features, it did cast doubt on a widespread hypothesis about the origins of deadly flu strains. In two other flu epidemics this century, in 1957 and 1968, a new virus that resembled bird viruses swept the world, leading Dr. Webster to propose that the worst strains of flu viruses arise in birds. But Dr. Taubenberger found that the 1918 virus was more closely related to viruses that infect pigs. ''That's different from the pandemics of 1957 and 1968,'' he said. ''It makes the hypothesis a bit more  complicated.'' He cannot say whether the virus jumped from pigs to humans or from humans to pigs, but, he said, he can rule out a direct avian origin. The work also showed that the 1918 virus apparently did not change much as it circled the globe. Dr. Taubenberger and his colleagues analyzed the complete hemagglutinin gene from one flu victim and half of it from two others. They found that the gene remained unchanged.
Contrary to popular opinion, support groups do not extend the lives of women with advanced breast cancer, according to a large study being published today. The study disputes a belief that has been stated so often it is almost considered a truism -- that the mind influences the course of advanced cancer so powerfully that patients can hold off death by getting emotional support in a group. The investigators began their study because they were concerned that many patients felt obligated to join support groups, whether they wanted to or not, to fight their cancer. Many were convinced of their  benefit by a small and inconclusive study published more than a decade ago indicating the groups could substantially prolong patients' lives. So the investigators, led by Dr. Pamela J. Goodwin, a medical oncologist at Mount Sinai Hospital of the University of Toronto, recruited 235 women with advanced breast cancer, assigning 158 to attend support groups and 77 not to attend the groups, for comparison. Those assigned to support groups had a median survival time of 17.9 months. Those who did not go to the groups had a median survival time of 17.6 months, an insignificant difference.
''In the old days, you had a heart attack and you died,'' said Dr. Claude Lenfant, who has monitored the changes as the institute's director for the last 21 years. ''You were almost signing the death certificate in advance. Now you know you can get another 20 or maybe 25 years.'' Dr. Eugene Braunwald, a cardiologist who is the chief academic officer at Harvard Medical School's Partners Health Care System, said the reductions in the death rates were ''one of the great triumphs of medicine in the past 50 years.'' But these triumphs have brought new problems. Many more men or women in their 70's and 80's are surviving heart attacks only to live on with severe heart disease. ''These people aren't cured,'' Dr. Braunwald said. ''They are maintained alive. We have converted heart disease from an acute illness to a chronic disease.'' Heart attack survivors often develop congestive heart failure, in which the damaged heart struggles to pump blood. As the heart's efficiency falls, fluid accumulates in the lungs and patients become so short of breath that they cannot walk across a room. Life after strokes can also be a trial, with dementia and nursing homes and increasing disability.
As justification, it cited studies finding a slight increase in death rates as the body mass increased above 25. The increases tended to be modest up to an index level of 30, the official designation for obesity. And though this mortality data was hardly solid, Dr. Oliver said, ''Overnight, 37 million people were suddenly overweight.'' Dr. Katherine Flegal, a statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics, says there is a problem with the graph, which was shaped like a shallow U with 25 at its base. ''If the nadir is 25, then, yes, mortality does begin to increase with B.M.I.'s above 25, so the statement is literally true,'' she said. ''But of course if the curve is U-shaped with a nadir at 25, then mortality also increases as B.M.I. decreases below 25.'' All of which suggests that a body mass index of 25, far from being dangerous, is actually optimal.
It is a cliche, of course, that men are tough deniers of illness, while women seek medical help and advice for the slightest twinge. There are thousands of exceptions, and doctors say behavior varies from culture to culture. Still, stereotypes are often rooted in reality. When a group of male doctors was recently asked to talk about patients who had taken control of their own medical care, with distressing results, the stories they told were invariably about men. ''Health is a macho thing,'' said Dr. I. Kelman Cohen, a plastic surgeon at the Medical College of Virginia in Richmond.  ''Men don't like to be out of control. So they deny their symptomology.'' While talking not long ago with a male doctor who happened to be a cancer specialist, Dr. Cohen said, he noticed that the man had a skin cancer and urged him to make an appointment to have it removed. Two days later, Dr. Cohen said, the man called back. ''It's gone,'' he said.
Dr. Brene and his colleagues reported that if they gave rats free access to a running wheel, they would run about about six miles a day. In that time, he finds, the three hallmark chemicals of addictive drugs -- enkephalin, dynorphin and substance P -- are produced in the reward centers of their brains. The interpretation is that the same brain systems are affected by running and by addictive drugs, Dr. Brene said. ''It is the same brain circuitry that is activated and it is possible that you can have the same pathology in the brain, the same addictive nature of the behavior.'' That is one reason Dr. Akil is so skeptical of the endorphin-runner's high hypothesis. She is willing to believe that exercise may elicit a sense of well-being sometimes, in some people, and she is willing to believe that some endorphins, somewhere in the brain, may be involved, although that is yet to be shown.
Lung samples from three people who died of the flu in 1918 ended up in Dr. Taubenberger's laboratory in fortuitous ways. One sample was from a 21-year-old Army private, Roscoe Vaughan, who died in Camp Jackson, S.C., at 6:30 A.M. on Sept. 26, 1918. At 2 P.M., an Army doctor arrived to do an autopsy, cutting off a slice from Mr. Vaughan's lungs, impregnating it with formaldehyde and embedding it in a chunk of candle wax about the size of a thumbnail. Then he sent it to Washington, where it was stored in a small brown box on a shelf of a vast pathology warehouse until Dr. Taubenberger found it one day in 1996. On the same day that Private Vaughan died, Pvt. James Downs, a 30-year-old soldier at Camp Upton, N.Y., succumbed to influenza after three days in the base hospital. He, too, was autopsied, by an army captain who wrote that a ''bloody froth''  came from Private Downs's lungs. His lung tissue, too, ended up in the pathology warehouse, stored until 1996.
Despite such uncertainties, Dr. Gordon said, it is important to look at what has been gained. People who would have been having heart attacks and dying in their 40's, 50's and 60's can now look forward to decades of healthy, productive life. ''People who would have died of a heart attack are now surviving,'' Dr. Gordon said. ''It's a trade-off that most people would make. ''
Some obesity experts would agree, saying  they are so concerned about the future lives and health of fat children that they advocate treatment even when the treatment's success has not been documented. ''I think it's better to do something, especially if it's based on sound nutritional advice and physical activity regimens,'' said Dr. Claude Bouchard, who directs the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. ''I think we should act.'' Others caution that throwing treatments at children can do more harm than good, adding to the misery of being fat. ''I know that urging kids to lose weight and putting them on a diet is not a good thing to do,'' said Dr. Evan Charney, chairman emeritus of the department of pediatrics at the University of Massachusetts Medical Center. ''Almost all will fail and then you blame them -- you blame the victim.'' Dr. Barry Kessler, a pediatrician in private practice in Egg Harbor Township, N.J., said: ''It's a toughie. It's a really frustrating thing for pediatricians. We like to see kids get well really fast, and this is not something that goes really fast and many times we don't succeed.''
Driving to a movie, had mild chest pains and blamed it on spicy mustard. Walked three blocks to theater. Pains worse. Told friend she thought she was having a heart attack. Ms. Atrubin rejected an ambulance. Friend drove her to emergency room. ''I am fairly poor and the first time I had a heart attack the ambulance cost me $600.'' So weak in car, could not fasten seat belt. At hospital, her arteries are propped open with two stents. Hospitalization from Oct. 29-Nov. 4. Two days in intensive care, four in intermediate care. Treatments include: stress tests, cardiac catheterization with two stents, electrocardiograms, blood tests to look for proteins from damaged heart muscle and medications, including an anti-clotting drug. Nov. 6 1997-Dec 10, 1998. Outpatient treatment includes: rehabilitation, blood tests, stress tests and physician visits. 2006  HEART SYMPTOMS  LATE JULY, AGE 75  CHARGES SUBMITTED TO INSURANCE, IN 2007 DOLLARS $7,159.94
Other F.D.A. watchers were surprised when the agency signaled a willingness to consider allowing a prescription morning-after pill, called Plan B, to be sold over the counter. Women's groups, like the National Women's Health Network, strongly support making Plan B available over the counter, but some religious groups strongly oppose it. Believing that pregnancy begins with fertilization, they say the pill can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting, and so it induces abortion. But the agency put on its advisory committee people known to support offering the pill over the counter. And the committee voted overwhelmingly to make it available without a prescription. ''Miraculously, I was appointed to the committee,'' said Dr. James Trussell of Princeton University, who has always wanted the drug to be offered over the counter. Some consumer groups argue that the Food and Drug Administration is too cozy with the industries it regulates. In fact, even industry groups that appear to have been hurt by some of Dr. McClellan's decisions speak well of his approach to the job.
For example, Dr. McClung asked if Fosamax helped in women with osteopenia. After six years, he found, the women taking Fosamax had a higher bone density than women taking a placebo but no fewer fractures. It usually takes 10 to 15 years after menopause before women get osteoporosis. ''If you are going to seriously try to prevent hip or spine fractures later in life, you want to be confident that these drugs will work in 5 or 10 years,'' Dr. Cummings said. ''A number of us are concerned that long-term treatments with drugs of this sort that stop the turnover of bone may lead to a lesser effect or no effect or even increase the risk of fracture.'' Bones, he explained, are constantly being remodeled, breaking down and growing in a process that, until middle age or so, is in balance. With bisphosphonates, remodeling is slowed. ''That turnover in bone, that cellular activity, seems to be a very strong indicator in risk of fractures,'' Dr. Cummings said. ''You want turnover, because if bone is not replaced over 30 years, it can weaken because of microscopic damage. Some of us believe that old, highly mineralized bone is more brittle, more prone to break.''
The conclusions of the draft report, but not the need for the advisory board review, were described on Wednesday in The Washington Post, sending industry groups and environmentalists scrambling to respond to a document that few had seen. The report is a revision of one the agency submitted for assessment by its advisory board in 1994. The board questioned the conclusions about dioxin's health effects and asked the agency to repeat its work. The draft is the result of that work. Staff members at the environmental agency said the new report's conclusions were based on scientific evidence that had emerged in recent years. A scientist for the agency said the E.P.A. was not responding to most calls from reporters on the draft report, but he agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. He said the data came from the agency's interpretation of studies in Dutch children showing that dioxin might alter development and that it might affect thyroid hormone secretions; studies of a group of men called the Ranch Hands, who flew planes for the Air Force in Vietnam and were exposed to dioxin while spraying the herbicide Agent Orange; and from studies of industrial workers.
The flood of desperate patients can be overwhelming, some scientists find. Dr. Faustman published a paper on Nov. 14 in the journal Science on diabetes in mice, showing that spleen cells could turn into pancreas cells and cure diabetes under certain conditions. Immediately, the e-mail and phone calls began, and the pleading letters with photos of children. ''I get 1,400 e-mails a week,'' she said. ''It's unbelievable. 'Why can't I volunteer?' I get prayers. They bring their kids into the lab. I have hired a person half-time just to answer the e-mails and the phone.'' Some patients say that no matter what they hear about the hurdles facing scientists, they have no choice but to remain hopeful. Mr. Arvedon, Emma's father, says he is not na√Øve. ''I know that even with the best scientists and the best aspirations and the most money, science can be fickle,'' he said. But he has to focus on a cure. Therapeutic cloning, or an understanding of diabetes that might come from it, ''seems the most rational route.''
Now Dr. Kozarek and his colleagues routinely reuse gastroenterology devices. ''We saved this institution about $65,000 in medical costs,'' he said. Some, like Dr. James T. Frakes, a gastroenterologist in Rockford, Ill., say they do not reuse devices because of liability concerns. But Dr. Frakes says such caution has a cost. ''We cannot afford to use some single-use accessories in our unit,'' he said. At the University of Virginia Health System, where electrocardiologists routinely reuse devices that can cost $1,000 or more per patient but far less if they are reused, there have been no safety problems, said Dr. David E. Haines, a professor of internal medicine there. Several groups have published papers reporting that it is safe to reuse the devices. And Dr. Haines says the economics of medicine leaves him little choice. ''The cost of single use is prohibitive,'' he said. ''If we were forced to have single use on catheters we would shift from being marginally profitable to probably losing $600,000 a year.''
Christina Koenig found out she had breast cancer on a Friday afternoon. She was just 39 years old. On Monday, she thought she knew why the cancer had struck. ''I went in and talked to a team of medical professionals who ultimately performed a lumpectomy, and I said, 'How long has this been there?' They said, 'Five to ten years.' And immediately, my mind jumped to: 'Well, I did go through a divorce. I did have stress.' '' Ms. Koenig, who lives in Chicago, was divorced four years before her cancer was diagnosed. Was it just a coincidence, she wondered? Now, four years later, she still wonders. So do many other women who get breast cancer. Ms. Koenig now works for Y-ME National Breast Cancer Organization, which gets 40,000 calls a year on its hot line. Over and over, she says, women ask, Did stress cause their cancer by weakening their immune system and allowing a tumor to grow?
Clusters will naturally appear even when events occur at random, said Dr. Persi Diaconis, a statistician at Stanford University. ''There was a famous example of this when bombs were hitting London during World War II,'' he said. ''People were sure they were targeting individual places and they made up the most elaborate scenarios'' to explain how the bomb targets were selected. But in the end, when the pattern was analyzed, the bombing turned out to be random. ANOTHER problem is how to draw the boundaries of a cluster. Dr. James Robins, a statistician at Harvard University's School of Public Health, said it is a natural tendency to draw boundaries around groups of events to make clusters happen. If there are three children with cancer on a single block, you may draw your circle around the block -- making that a cluster -- rather than around the town as a whole, which may show no cluster.
Ms. Roche was the third subject in the study to inhale hexamethonium. The first subject developed a cough and shortness of breath upon exertion. Those effects lasted for a week. But Dr. Togias did not report that subject's symptoms to the review board overseeing the study, reasoning that they were not serious and that they were probably due to a cold that was going around in the research unit, or to the acidity of the hexamethonium solution. A few days after the first subject recovered, Ms. Roche took the drug, became ill and went to the hospital. Dr. Lewis Becker, the chairman of the internal investigating committee, said he did not blame Dr. Togias for not recognizing the possible significance of the first volunteer's reaction to the drug. ''I can completely understand how he could have attributed it to a cold or the high acidity of the solution,'' he said.
Dr. Lepay said the F.D.A. thought Hopkins was looking for information on studies that fall into a gray area, not ones involving unapproved drugs like hexamethonium. In the meantime, Dr. Togias went ahead with his study, without applying to the F.D.A. After assessing hexamethonium's safety by searching the medical literature, he concluded that its main side effect was a possible transient lowering of blood pressure. The ethics committee approved his study, which was to involve 10 healthy volunteers. He then bought hexamethonium, sterilized it and began giving it to his study subjects, in amounts as high as 1 gram each. Some doctors said that was an extraordinarily large amount to inhale. The first person developed a cough and shortness of breath but got better in a week. Dr. Togias did not report those symptoms, deciding that the volunteer had caught a cold or that her symptoms were caused by the acidity of the hexamethonium solution. He altered the chemical to make it less acidic and gave it to a second volunteer, who had no adverse effects.
''We're working aggressively with pharmaceutical companies,'' said Dr. O'Rahilly, declining to identify the drug companies backing his work or to quantify their support. Scientists, studying families and twins, have long known that genes help determine weight. So Dr. O'Rahilly is now looking for genetic abnormalities that can make some children enormously fat. Those same genes, he theorizes, may be at work to a slighter degree in people who are overweight or obese, but not morbidly so. Dr. O'Rahilly does not dispute the statistics showing that on average people of all genetic makeup have grown fatter in recent years in industrial countries. ''But genes determine where a person fits in the bell curve,'' he said. ''Not everyone is fat. If the environment is so toxic, if whatever we're doing is like mercury poisoning, we'd all be fat.'' So far, he says he has found four previously unrecognized genetic disorders that can cause obesity. Each one makes people eat voraciously, Dr. O'Rahilly says. Rather than being slothful, he said, ''these children simply are not satisfied.''
''Over the course literally of minutes, the cells converted from rather pedestrian, flat, undistinguished stem cells into absolutely typical neuron-looking cells,'' Dr. Black said, explaining that they looked like bright spheres surrounded by halos. Then the cells began growing long fibrous extensions, just like nerve cells. ''We were disbelieving,'' Dr. Black said. As the cells continued to change their type, they matured into cells that appeared, by all the chemical tests that Dr. Black applied, to be nerve cells. By tinkering with the chemical signals he used to stimulate the conversion, Dr. Black and his colleagues were able to turn 80 percent of the bone marrow cells into nerve cells. He said he transplanted the rat nerve cells to the brains and spinal cords of rats and found that they survived, for months so far. Other neurobiolgists said they were impressed. ''It's really beautiful,'' said Dr. William Greenough, a neuroscientist at the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology of the University of Illinois. While many researchers are working with tissue from embryos or with animal cells to develop replacement cells for the human body, and others are trying to redirect mature cells from other body organs to become replacement cells, Dr. Black's approach has some potential advantages: bone marrow cells are easy to obtain, and they could theoretically be obtained from the very patient to be treated, eliminating the problem of adding foreign tissue that the immune system might attack. ''I see this as a truly significant step along the way toward developing new technologies for the repair of the damaged brain,'' Dr. Greenough said.
Yet another idea is to try to help the brain cope with the small amyloid proteins. The notion comes from studies linking a cholesterol-carrying protein to a risk of developing Alzheimer's. People can inherit any of three forms of the protein -- Apo E2, Apo E3 or Apo E4. Those who have the Apo E4 form are more likely to develop Alzheimer's than those with the other forms of the protein. Dr. Mucke and his colleagues have found that Apo E3 can protect the brains of mice from amyloid. (They have not yet examined Apo E2, which confers an even lower risk than Apo E3.) ''If we look at middle-aged mice that make human amyloid and Apo E3, they are fine,'' Dr. Mucke said. ''At the same time, those that make human amyloid and Apo E4 have lost a significant number of synapses.'' His colleagues at the Gladstone Institute are developing drugs that convert Apo E4 to apo E3. The two forms of the protein differ in just one amino acid, No. 112 of the chain of 229 amino acids that make it up, and that one amino acid determines how the protein is folded.
Correction:  January 5, 2005, Wednesday  An article in Science Times yesterday about the state of research on commercial weight-loss programs misstated the middle name of a scientist who helped collect information about them. He is Dr. Adam Gilden Tsai, not Gilman.
Stride length, Dr. Fitts said, is also important. ''If you have the proper stride length when you push off, then you get the proper extension and flexion,'' he said. ''If you take too short of a stride, you look like a shuffler. If it is too long, you look like you are bouncing. A good runner should almost be able to run with an apple on their head.'' Finally, Dr. Fitts advised, many people hold their arms too high, making their shoulder muscles work while they run. ''It is better to hold your arms along your waist, with bent elbows,'' he said. He added that these are all errors that can be corrected. ''Most people don't know these things just because they start to run,'' he said ''Somebody has to tell you. But most people at these road races are very inefficient. They never were taught at all.'' With elite runners, the question is not so much technique but rather the tiny physiological differences that make one smooth, relaxed, fast runner win every race while another, who looks equally good, falls behind.
She wanted a Pap test, but it would have been useless, Dr. Min said, because she had had a hysterectomy. She wanted a chest X-ray, an electrocardiogram. Not necessary, he told her, because it was unlikely that they would reveal a problem that needed treating before symptoms emerged. She left with just a few tests, including blood pressure and cholesterol. Dr. Min was proud of himself until about a week later, when the local paper published a letter from his patient -- about him. ''Socialized medicine has arrived,'' she wrote. Admitting defeat, he called her and offered her the tests she had wanted, on the house. She accepted, Dr. Min said, but after having the full physical exam, she never returned. Proponents of evidence-based medicine acknowledge that repeated tests like chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, rectal exams, pelvic exams, urinanalyses and blood work do occasionally find problems before symptoms emerge. But that does not make them necessary or even advisable, said Dr. David Atkins, the science adviser to the United States Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts that advises the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.
Women, meanwhile, are flooding advocacy organizations with calls  asking what they should do. In their advertisement in The Times, the health organizations said: ''While the existing studies of mammography screening have known limitations and even some flaws, the evidence as a whole solidly supports reduced breast cancer mortality rates due to mammography screening. Early breast cancer detection means a greater chance for successful treatment and a greater range of treatment options.'' Others disagree. ''The evidence is not strong enough to support regular screening mammograms,'' said Dr. Donald Berry, the head of biostatistics at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and a member of the panel that voted last week to step away from its conclusion that the test prevents breast cancer deaths. Dr. Peter C. Gotzsche, director of the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen, whose Lancet paper started the debate, said he had no regrets. ''Women have received a quite simple message until now -- come early and then we can cure you,'' Dr. Gotzsche said.
It had been an inflammatory statement, Dr. Lleras-Muney says. And for good reason. It could only be true if education in and of itself caused good health. But there were at least two other possibilities. Maybe sick children did not go to school, or dropped out early because they were ill. Or maybe education was a proxy for wealth, and it was wealth that led to health. It could be that richer parents who gave their children everything, including better nutrition, better medical care and a better education, had children who, by virtue of being wealthy, lived longer. How, she asked herself, could she sort out causes and effects? It was the chicken-and-egg problem that plagues such research. The answer came one day when Dr. Lleras-Muney was reading another economics paper. It indicated that about 100 years ago, different states started passing laws forcing children to go to school for longer periods. She knew what to do.
He and others cautioned that before deciding to be screened women should weigh the risks of mammograms, like false positives and being treated for tumors that would not have spread if they were left alone. The study was an effort to understand why the breast cancer death rate had dropped so drastically so rapidly -- 24 percent from 1990 to 2000. Was it mammograms, which can find cancers early when they may be more treatable, or was it powerful new drugs to treat the cancers? The two factors had been tested in clinical trials, but researchers did not know what occurred in the real world, where women did not always follow medical advice and doctors did not always use the tests and drugs as carefully as in the studies. Most of the researchers expected that drugs would be working, because the clinical trials were so persuasive. But there was a sharp dispute over whether mammograms, whose clinical trials were more ambiguous, had much benefit outside those trials.
''People in all of those circumstances have been followed. And they have no higher incidence of cancer.'' Many large studies of cancer and stress were done in Denmark, which has national records of illnesses. One looked at the incidence of cancer in 11,380 parents whose children had cancer, surely a stressful event, Dr. Cassileth said. The parents, though, had no more cancer than members of the general population. Another study looked at the cancer rate among 21,062 parents who had lost a child. There was no increase in cancer among the parents for up to 18 years afterward. A third Danish study looked at cancer rates among 19,856 parents who had a child with schizophrenia. Once again, there was no increase in cancer. It also is unclear whether stress reduction can improve the prognosis of people who already have cancer. ''If the question is, Have we established it?, the answer is, Absolutely not,'' said Sheldon Cohen, a psychology professor at Carnegie Mellon University who has studied the role of support groups and stress reduction in cancer. ''If the question is, Would it work?, we don't know that, either.''
But, said Dr. Jeffrey M. Drazen, the editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, people who want the operation have no trouble finding a surgeon to do it outside the study, including surgeons at the very medical centers taking part in the study. Dr. Drazen told of a man who recently paid cash for the surgery. ''He said, 'It was between buying a Lexus and getting the operation,' '' Dr. Drazen said. People with the worst emphysema have now been barred from the study, but if the operation turns out to help most other participants, Medicare could face a huge bill. Dr. Make said that about one out of three emphysema patients qualifies for the federal study. With two million emphysema patients in the country, most of Medicare age, and at the discounted $30,000 price that Medicare pays for the operation, it would cost $20 billion to operate on all who would be eligible.
''It's a fantastic study, and they showed a very powerful effect,'' said Dr. Breitner, who is directing a study of anti-inflammatory drugs in people at risk of becoming ill with Alzheimer's. A potential flaw in the Dutch study is that the scientists did not randomly assign people to take active drugs or dummy pills for comparison purposes. For that reason, they cannot be certain it was the drugs and not some other characteristic of the patients that made the difference. Because the drugs have side effects like serious, sometimes fatal, stomach bleeding, medical experts advise healthy people to await the results of randomized trials now under way before taking anti-inflammatory drugs other than aspirin in the hope of preventing Alzheimer's. A strength of the study is that the researchers had highly reliable information about what drugs the participants took, because for most of the study period nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were available in the Netherlands only by prescription, and the Dutch keep excellent records on the use of prescription drugs.
No one doubts that the new recommendations will be expensive. But, Dr. Cleeman said, statins, which cost about $100 a month, are cost effective in those who should be taking them, because heart disease costs ''hundreds of billions of dollars.'' Statins, which can reduce the risk of heart disease by 30 percent to 40 percent, he said, ''compare very favorably to other standard treatments, like treatments for hypertension.'' The stock of Pfizer and Merck, two manufacturers of statin drugs, showed little change yesterday. Heart disease researchers say they are taken aback by the speed at which the old rules are being rewritten in response to growing evidence that lower is better. ''It is really quite extraordinary,'' said Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. He said, ''When I was in medical school, I was taught that any cholesterol level under 300 was normal.'' He explained that someone with a total cholesterol level of 300 will have an L.D.L. level over 200.
There are 5 products on the market that contain estrogen and progestins and 15 that contain estrogen alone, the agency said. Kim Schillace, a spokeswoman for Berlex Laboratories, a Montville, N.J., company that makes an estrogen patch, said that the company would work with the agency on revising its label. ''We will have to make changes, but we have to determine what those changes will be,'' Ms. Schillace said. But with 10 million women in this country still taking estrogen products, the agency's decision sends a strong message, medical experts said. Putting a black box on a drug's label is a regulatory action, and it is not taken lightly. ''Having a black box on the label is a big deal,'' said Dr. Susan Hendrix, a gynecologist at Wayne State University in Detroit who was an investigator in the federal study. ''It's pretty astounding to go from a year ago thinking this is one of the most benign drugs to a 180-degree turn in the opposite direction.''
Many are like 60-year-old Thomas E. Siko of Chagrin Falls, Ohio, who thought he had nothing to worry about. Heart disease runs in his family on both sides, but no doctor had ever suggested cholesterol-lowering medication. His H.D.L. level was high, at 72, and his L.D.L. only mildly elevated, at 121. (National guidelines say that an L.D.L. level of less than 100 is optimal; 100 to 129 is near or above optimal, depending on other factors; and above 130 is high.) But last year, after being tested for what he thought was indigestion, Mr. Siko ended up having bypass surgery. Now, with a cholesterol-lowering statin, his L.D.L. level is down to 72 while his H.D.L. is 70. He feels fine. ''I run four miles a day,'' Mr. Siko said. Part of the confusion arises from an evolving view of the immense importance of reducing L.D.L. levels. Two recent studies, one announced last week, the other published the week before, found that ultra-low levels of L.D.L., down to the 60's or 70's, can protect heart patients from plaque growth in their arteries and from heart attacks and deaths. That raised questions among many doctors and patients of whether their own L.D.L. levels really were optimal and whether their good cholesterol really was canceling out the bad.
But, as the newly discovered letters illustrate, there was an active epidemiological investigation. A letter dated Nov. 9, 1793, from a Maj. Samuel Hodgson to the College of Physicians, explores evidence for a hypothesis that the disease came from a load of rotting coffee: ''The Sloop Amelia came to the Wharf the 23rd July and immediately began to discharge her Cargo -- this Vessel was wholly loaded with Coffee in Bags the lower tier of which from the leaky condition of the Vessel were under water &amp; found to be wholly rotten, and when thrown on the Wharf occasioned a most intolerable stench for several days. Two of her passengers or Crew I am informed died on board her while she lay at the Wharf.'' Major Hodgson also considered the refugee hypothesis, telling of a ship that arrived on Aug. 7, ''loaded with Passengers from the Cape all of which with their baggage were landed on the Wharf -- from this Vessel I saw a woman taken, who appear'd to be extremely ill &amp; with her child put on a Dray provided for her.''
The two studies so far of spiral CT scanning tested it on smokers and former smokers, documenting the test's ability to find tumors when they are very small. Dr. Henschke, who directed one study, estimated that the method could allow as many as 80 percent of lung cancer patients to survive at least five years. Just 15 percent live that long now. But neither her study nor one conducted by Japanese scientists included a group of patients who, for comparison, did not have the test, raising questions of whether the patients really lived longer than they would have if they had not taken part in the study. Now, Dr. Henschke said, she and her colleagues are planning to enroll 10,000 patients in the New York area for additional study of the method's efficacy. That study would not include a control group of patients who did not get the screening test.
The virus then, of a type known as H5N1, first appeared among chickens being sold live in Hong Kong markets. Influenza is common in birds and usually of no consequence even to them. This virus, however, not only was killing chickens but  quickly appeared in humans as well. Members of an international team of researchers who rushed to Hong Kong were shocked by what they saw, and readily admitted that they feared the worst. ''We were seeing young kids get hospitalized; we were seeing young adults get hospitalized, end up on respirators and die,'' said Dr. Keiji Fukuda of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And these, Dr. Fukuda said, were people who had been generally healthy. ''That was chilling,'' he said. At the same time, Dr. Kennedy Shortridge, a virologist at the University of Hong Kong, was investigating the ravaging of the chickens. ''We saw a bird standing up there, pecking away at its food,'' Dr. Shortridge said, ''and then very gently fall over, lying on its side, looking dead. Blood was trickling.''
A new report by researchers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston has found little evidence to support a widely held belief about clinical trials of experimental cancer treatments: that patients who enroll in them fare better than those who do not. ''There may be a difference in outcomes, but to our view it hasn't been shown,'' said Dr. Steven Joffe, a pediatric cancer specialist at Dana-Farber and an author of the paper, which is being published today in the British journal Lancet. Many cancer specialists have long assumed that being in a clinical trial leads to a better outcome. The studies often take place at leading cancer centers, where care tends to be of the highest quality. In a clinical trial, patients are usually assigned randomly to receive an experimental therapy or the standard one. Dr. Joffe said he and his colleagues undertook the study after hearing ''prominent folks in the field'' speaking out at medical meetings ''and saying that being in a trial contributes to better outcomes.''
Added to that, said Dr. Donald Berry, a statistician at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, is the desire to attribute effects to causes. For instance, he said, he read an article on the effects of biofeedback on blood pressure. The blood pressure of a group that did not have biofeedback fell just as much as it did in the group that did. The researchers decided that they were seeing a powerful placebo effect just from entering the study. ''They said, 'This is amazing. It shows the benefit of being in a clinical trial,' '' Dr. Berry said. But there is a simpler interpretation, he said.  Among the study participants were people whose blood pressure, by chance, had just edged up enough so that they qualified. According to the statistical rule called regression to the mean, it is almost certain to be lower the next time it is measured. The high reading was an anomaly. The biofeedback -- and the placebo effect -- may well have done nothing.
''We did not find a relationship,'' Professor Kalick said. ''That was kind of surprising.'' But when he asked another group of volunteers to look at the photographs and guess how healthy the study subjects were, the raters assumed that the most attractive people were the healthiest. ''People really think that attractiveness indicates health,'' Professor Kalick said. ''It's just that they're mistaken about it.'' Elizabeth Haiken, a history professor at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and author of the recent book ''Venus Envy: A History of Cosmetic Surgery'' (Johns Hopkins University Press), said her research indicated that the perceived relationship between health and beauty became entrenched early in the 20th century with a popular-psychology movement that said if you felt better about yourself, you would be healthier, stronger, more able to act -- a sort of health-through- self-esteem movement. And what better way to feel good about yourself, or so advertisers proclaimed, than to make yourself as beautiful as you could be?
While the letters do not change the general picture of the epidemic, they offer new details and give the events immediacy. Reading the letters, said Charles Greifenstein, the college's curator of archives, he felt ''the vicarious archival thrill,'' adding ''you can really feel like you're there, like you are part of the community.'' In an odd twist, one of the letters -- from June 1790 -- describes a case of anthrax in a farmer, Nathaniel Browner. His doctor, Benjamin Say, writes that Mr. Browner had ''severe Chills'' that were ''followed by a violent pain in his head.'' He had a blister on his back, apparently caused by an anthrax infection of his skin, that was as big as a ''garden sized pea'' but grew until it was ''about the size of a large hen's egg.'' Dr. Say gave Mr. Browner poultices, complained that he was not called in early enough and asked two other doctors to consult. Then, said Mr. Greifenstein, the letter ''just sort of ends.'' Dr. Say never tells whether Mr. Browner recovered.
Dr. Brigid Hogan, the chairwoman of the department of cell biology at the Duke University Medical Center, was also highly skeptical. Dr. Hogan, who was a member of a recent National Academy of Sciences committee that reported on human cloning, said the group interviewed Dr. Brigitte Boisselier, the head of Clonaid. ''I did not come away thinking that this was a group that would clone,'' Dr. Hogan said. ''Let's see some data.'' Although several species of animals have been cloned, until yesterday no one had claimed to have cloned a chimpanzee or other primate, the closest human relatives in the animal kingdom. And many clones have turned out to suffer sometimes devastating congenital defects, a situation that has led many experts in animal cloning to condemn human reproduction by cloning as unethical. To clone, scientists slip the nucleus of an adult cell, like a skin cell, into an unfertilized egg from which its own genetic material has been removed. Then, if stimulated to act like a fertilized egg, the newly altered genetic material can then direct the egg to divide and grow into an embryo, then a fetus, then a newborn, if all goes well. Yet, as scientists have discovered, only rarely does all go well.
People who take high doses of vitamin E to improve their health may not be getting any benefits and may, in fact, be slightly increasing their risks of dying earlier, researchers reported yesterday. The adverse effect was tiny, however, and some experts with no connections to the vitamin industry say they are not convinced it was demonstrated. It emerged only when the researchers pooled the results from 19 clinical trials involving 135,967 participants. That led them to conclude that there were 39 additional deaths per 10,000 people who were taking vitamin E doses exceeding 400 international units a day. The recommended daily amount of vitamin E is about 20 international units a day, and the dose in a multivitamin pill is about 30 units. People take much higher doses because they believe that at high doses the vitamin acts like a drug, protecting them from disease. The new study, by Dr. Edgar R. Miller III, an associate professor of medicine and epidemiology at Johns Hopkins University, will be published on Jan. 4 in The Annals of Internal Medicine. Dr. Miller presented the data at the American Heart Association meeting yesterday in New Orleans, and the journal is making the paper available free on its Web site, www.annals.org.
He found nodules of unknown significance on people's kidneys and adrenal glands. And he found aneurysms, bulging bubbles on blood vessels. In the end, Dr. Swensen said, more than 90 percent of the group had something suspicious on one or more of their scans. Some ended up with surgery that may have saved their lives. But many, Dr. Swensen said, suffered needless operations and other medical procedures for something that may have been innocuous. It is not even clear yet whether the early diagnosis of lung cancers helped, Dr. Swensen said. Some of the tumors might have been too slow growing to be dangerous and others might have already spread by the time he found them. People who undergo spiral CT lung scans probably ''assume that this could save their lives,'' Dr. Swensen said. ''That is absolutely, unequivocally unproven.'' But patients do not usually look at screening tests from that perspective. ''They think they have little to lose,'' said Dr. Steven H. Woolf, a professor of family practice at Virginia Commonwealth University in Fairfax and a member of the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force, a federally sponsored but independent group that evaluates evidence for screening tests and publishes guidelines. ''They have little idea of the risk that awaits them.''
Dr. Blair, for one, is not convinced. Some people stay thin with no exercise. Others, like him, gain weight no matter what they do. ''I have run at least 45 minutes a day for 30-some years,'' Dr. Blair said, adding that he also watched his diet. And yet, he said, ''I gained 25 pounds.'' With pronounced individual variations in propensities to gain weight, Dr. Blair said, the evidence is insufficient, in his opinion, to say that 60 minutes of exercise a day is needed to prevent obesity. But when it comes to heart health, he and others say, the evidence is convincing, if not compelling, that 30 minutes of brisk walking on most days gives most of the benefit that exercise can deliver. ''It's important that the public understand that exercise doesn't need to be strenuous, it doesn't need to be uncomfortable, it should not be onerous,'' Dr. Manson said. She cautioned, however, that many people overestimate how much exercise they get.
THE optimism comes from work that began with the discovery of leptin, the first molecule ever found that acts on the brain as part of a natural weight control system. As such, it has revealed molecular pathways that may lead to truly effective and precisely targeted weight loss drugs. ''This is my prediction,'' said Dr. Steven B. Heymsfield, who is deputy director of the obesity research center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York and who directed the recent leptin study. ''We are going to be able to turn off appetite completely -- eventually. The therapeutics will be sophisticated enough to stop people from eating.'' HE added that while there are certainly social and environmental influences on body weight -- people who live in southern states tend to be fatter, poor people tend to be fatter --  eventually obesity will be controlled just like high cholesterol levels. Those who cannot, or will not, control their levels through diet can take a pill.
The question now is whether there are enough doubts about mammography's benefits and enough evidence of its risks that women should reconsider having them. Some risks lie not in the test itself, but in the treatments -- chemotherapy, surgery and radiation -- when malignancies are found. But what if mammograms are picking up tumors that would never threaten a woman's life, and would otherwise never have been noticed -- or treated? What if mammograms are finding tumors that could be treated just as well a few years later, forcing the woman to spend those years with the dreadful knowledge that she has breast cancer?  BUT many doctors say it is inappropriate for scientists to quibble about the fine points of evidence in the case of a devastating disease like breast cancer. ''Unfortunately, the people making these arguments are statisticians,'' said Dr. Maurie Markman, a specialist in gynecological cancer at the Cleveland Clinic.
SIX KILLERS: HEART DISEASE
Dr. Micozzi agreed. ''It was in the context of this huge renovation project,'' he said. ''Things get turned over and brought to the surface. It's a little like plowing a field.'' Correction:  November 28, 2001, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an article in Science Times on Nov. 6 about a yellow fever epidemic in 1793 in Philadelphia, then the nation's capital, misstated the death toll. About 5,000 people died, not 55,000.
The way to answer that question was to randomly assign men to be treated, with the surgery, or to forgo treatment unless and until the cancer spread in their body. The Swedish investigators found that after an average of 6.2 years of follow-up, 16 of the 347 men who had surgery died of prostate cancer, or 4.6 percent. But 31 of the 348 who were assigned to watchful waiting died of prostate cancer, or 8.9 percent, a statistically significant difference. The researchers calculated that 17 men would have to have the operation to prevent one death from prostate cancer over an eight-year period. The study did not include other popular prostate cancer treatments, for example, external beam radiation, which is directed at a man's prostate, or radioactive seeds, which are implanted in the prostate. Although doctors assume that the treatments are more or less equivalent to prostate surgery, that has not been rigorously demonstrated, nor has it been shown that these treatments prevent prostate cancer deaths.
But the new analysis, of seven large studies of mammography conducted over the past few decades, says those promises are an illusion. It calls into question the assumption that early identification of breast tumors, before they can be felt in an external examination, improves the chances of a cure. Those studies that found benefits from mammography were flawed, say the investigators, Dr. Peter Gotzsche, director of the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen, and Ole Olsen, the deputy director. Recent studies, more rigorously designed and conducted, found no such effects, they assert. For example, they criticize a New York study from more than a quarter of a century ago finding that women who never had a mammogram died of breast cancer at a rate 30 percent higher than those who had the test. (Of the 30,565 who were never screened, 196 died over an 18-year period; of the 30,131 who had the test, 153 died.)
''Everyone thought letrozole would have a modest effect,'' said Dr. James N. Ingle, the principal investigator for the United States in the study. ''Everyone was surprised.'' Dr. Harold J. Burstein of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston wrote in an editorial that it was an ''unexpected and robust difference in the rate of events.'' One reason for expecting much less, explained Dr. John Bryant of the University of Pittsburgh and Dr. Norman Wolmark of Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, in an editorial they wrote, is that tamoxifen's results linger after the drug is stopped. Studies found that women who took it for five years had a 30 percent lower risk of recurrence in the next five years than women who never took it. So the letrozole benefit came on top of the tamoxifen effect, making it even more substantial. ''This finding is remarkable,'' they wrote. But many questions remain. Letrozole is not entirely benign. It acts by blocking an enzyme, an aromatase, that converts hormones from the adrenal gland to estrogen, halting the main source of estrogen in postmenopausal women and reducing their blood levels of estrogen by more than 95 percent. It also raises the risk of osteoporosis and can cause hot flashes and night sweats.
''If it turns out that there is a little bit of mortality decrease, what are we doing to do? And who decides?'' Dr. Harris asked. ''It's a tough issue. Lord help us.''
Dr. Seeff was not quite sure what to say to Mr. Woodland. If Mr. Woodland had simply showed up in Dr. Seeff's medical office that day, without the old blood sample indicating that he had had hepatitis C for 50 years, Dr. Seeff knew what he would have done. ''I would say, 'Let's do a liver biopsy and if he has cirrhosis, let's treat him.' '' But, Dr. Seeff said: ''Here's a man who's 69 years old. He's been positive for 50 years. Treatment couldn't have done a better job. The question is, do you impose treatment on him? Dr. Seeff put the choice to Mr. Woodland. While Mr. Woodland sat in his office that rainy afternoon late last month, Dr. Seeff nervously told him that he still had hepatitis C and that the only way to know if the virus had damaged his liver was to have a biopsy. He asked Mr. Woodland to think it over and to get back to him.
It was a new way to think about cardiovascular disease and a new way to think about aging, Dr. Newman said. ''With frailty,'' she said, ''the slowing of gait, the loss of muscle strength, we had chalked up to being totally nonpreventable.'' When Dr. Newman and her colleagues examined participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study they saw evidence that their hunch seemed right. Participants with obvious disease who had congestive heart failure or a heart attack or stroke, for example -- were likely to be frail. But those with no symptoms but partly blocked blood vessels seen on scans and other tests were nearly three times as likely to be frail as healthier people. And they became disabled -- unable to care for themselves -- about five years earlier than people without cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. The researchers emphasize that cardiovascular disease is unlikely to be the sole cause of frailty. Severe arthritis or osteoporosis, for example, could make people slow down and set the cycle in motion. Strokes, heart attacks, cancer or any number of illnesses could bring on the frailty syndrome. But in explaining frailty among seemingly healthy people, the findings on cardiovascular disease made sense.
But these cancer survivors do have one thing in common. The prospect of death is no longer a cerebral awareness but is an unavoidable part of daily life. ''One knows in the abstract from a very early age that life is limited and that there is an end to it,'' said Musa Mayer, a New York writer, breast cancer survivor and advocate for breast cancer patients. ''But the first time your own death has a name attached to it, the first time you can clearly see the path from here to there, is a life-changing experience.'' Few are prepared. Even medical experts who thought they knew all about cancer say the raw emotions, the icy fear of hearing that they themselves have cancer, can push all their intellectualizing aside. For Dr. Gallo, the loss of innocence came on a cold Friday afternoon in February when he and his wife were driving on the Connecticut Turnpike, on their way to Cape Cod to work on their vacation home. His cell phone rang, a call from the surgeon who had removed a small lump from Dr. Gallo's groin. Dr. Gallo and the surgeon had been sure it was inconsequential.
Dr. Gold said that level was equivalent on a body-weight basis to 1/700 of the dose of acrylamide that gives tumors to 10 percent of rats, an exposure ratio similar to other naturally occurring chemicals in the diet like furfural, which is in bread and coffee. Dr. Michael F. Jacobson, who is executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group based in Washington, said that he was not ready to dismiss the Swedish findings. ''The government needs to make sure the Swedes are right,'' Dr. Jacobson said. ''And if they are, then the government needs to test a wide range of American foods to understand the depths of the problem.'' Meanwhile, he said, it would be prudent to avoid foods like potato chips and French fries, which are known to contain lots of health-damaging fat as well as acrylamide. Dr. Gold said that a more prudent course would be for people to avoid the major known sources of human cancer, like smoking cigarettes.
The recommendations, which modify guidelines set by the government only two and a half years ago, will increase by a few million the number of Americans who meet the criteria for therapy with the powerful cholesterol-reducing drugs called statins, and many people who are already taking the medications will be advised to increase their doses. Under the old guidelines, about 36 million people in this country should be taking statins, said Dr. James Cleeman, coordinator of the National Cholesterol Education Program. But only about half that number do. In the report, the health officials addressed three questions: When are statins merely a sensible option? When are they imperative? And how aggressively should patients be treated? The recommendations focus on the levels of L.D.L., rather than total cholesterol levels, because L.D.L. is the target of cholesterol-lowering therapies. One change applies to people at moderately high risk, defined as having risk factors like advancing age, high blood pressure or smoking that confer a 10 percent to 20 percent chance of suffering a heart attack in the next decade. Under the new recommendations, doctors now have the option of prescribing drug therapy for such patients if their level of L.D.L. cholesterol is 100 or higher, the report says, and a level of below 100 can be set as a goal.
Connie Golas, the specialist who worked with Mr. Littlefield, said doctors sometimes do not realize the patients' problems. It is not that the patients refused to follow instructions; it is that they did not know how. Ms. Golas sees this, for example, when she visits patients and asks to look at their medications. ''They bring out this box or basket or shoebox and they pull out all these medications,'' Ms. Golas said. ''They pull out one -- it was from two years ago. They say, 'I guess I shouldn't be taking this now.''' But Ms. Golas also understands the doctor's perspective. When patients say they cannot make a doctor understand, it may be that they did not really explain what was wrong. ''A seasoned nurse or receptionist will screen the pile of messages,'' Ms. Golas said. ''If the patient doesn't know how to communicate, if he says, 'Well, I'm coughing a little more than usual,' instead of 'I can't breathe and have to sit up at night,' then that message may be put in among the calls about the snotty noses. The patient may not get a call for three days.''
''At the present time,'' Dr. Golub said, ''where we have only a crude molecular understanding and classification of disease, there is the potential for multibillion-dollar drugs and a huge market opportunity. You treat lots of patients, knowing that not everyone will respond. ''But what will happen when we refine this technology based on the genome? Now the landscape becomes a larger number of smaller diseases. What was once a big opportunity becomes a smaller opportunity.'' ''We will take a disease like cancer, which used to be a single disease, and chop it up into a million little bits, none of which is big enough to make it attractive'' to the big companies to develop a medication, Dr. Golub said. Not all scientists expect to see change come quickly, and many note that there is more to making a cell than just a collection of individual genes. For now, even with all that is known about genes and cells, deep mysteries remain.
A large study in China on breast self-examination found no evidence that it prevented deaths from breast cancer. The study involved 266,064 women who worked in Shanghai factories. Half were assigned to examine their breasts every month for lumps and were taught how to do it. The rest served as controls. Mammography is not widely available in China, so self-examination is the best hope of finding tumors early. But now, 11 years later, the study investigators, led by Dr. David B. Thomas of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, report that there was no difference in the death rates between the two groups. Their paper, published in the Oct. 2 issue of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, reported that there were 135 breast cancer deaths among the women who were assigned to breast self-examination and 131 in the women who served as controls. The difference is not statistically significant. But the women who examined their breasts did find more lumps, resulting in more biopsies for lumps that turned out not to be cancerous. Yet there was no evidence that those cancers that were detected were found at an earlier stage.
While most sheep are shy around humans and huddle at the back of their pens when visitors arrive, Dolly loved attention. She rushed to the front of her stall when she saw people coming by, bleating loudly. Visitors always wanted to feed her, but the Roslin scientists explained that she had an obesity problem. Dolly did finally get her weight under control, Dr. Wilmut said, ''a lot more easily than most people do.'' Her health was generally good. Her main problem was arthritis in her left hip and knee, but University of Edinburgh veterinarians said joint disease is common in middle-aged sheep. Dolly is survived by six lambs, produced the customary way, with a ram.
For the first time, researchers have shown in the most rigorous kind of studies that aspirin can reduce the risk of developing colon and rectal polyps, the precursors of almost all colon cancer. That is the finding of two clinical trials, which, taken together, are one of the few cancer prevention efforts to bear fruit thus far. And since they involve colon and rectal cancer, second only to lung cancer among leading causes of cancer-related deaths in this country, many medical experts are elated. But the experts also caution that people still need to be screened whether or not they take aspirin. While the newly reported studies found that aspirin meant polyps in fewer patients, it did not prevent all polyps. Further, the researchers say that while they would encourage some patients at high risk of colon cancer to take aspirin daily -- either a regular pill or a baby aspirin -- those at average risk may face more risks from the drug than benefits. Aspirin can inhibit blood clotting, a circumstance that can lead to strokes, or irritate the stomach lining, leading to ulcers.
Dr. Snider says he knows about that tobacco office analysis and is aware of that criticism of the mortality estimates. But, he said, he does not think that is the entire answer to getting the statistics right, and he is counting on the Institute of Medicine Review to provide guidance. But that institute is not going to satisfy someone like Dr. Glantz. Antitobacco advocates are furious, he said, and he hears from them regularly. But others, too, are outraged, Dr. Glantz said. When he mentioned his criticisms of the centers' statistics at a National Cancer Institute meeting on tobacco control, he said, ''it was like turning on a spigot.'' The Institute of Medicine meeting, he added, ''is more politics.''
''Then the fees slowly ratcheted down,'' Dr. Hansen said. In the meantime, she said, with fewer and fewer patients who pay the full rates, she has no choice but to keep prices for those patients high. Her take-home income, she said, is half that of two or three years ago. Individual doctors are not the only ones in difficult straits. Hospital administrators say the same sequence of events happened to them, with often devastating effects. The administrators said their problems began about a decade ago when insurance companies offered to make their hospitals ''preferred providers,'' meaning that patients insured by the companies would go to those hospitals en masse, if the hospitals slashed their prices. It sounded workable -- volume in exchange for a discount. But soon the insurers discovered that their patients wanted a choice of providers. So instead of sending all their patients to one hospital, insurers offered choices. The hospitals were left with the low prices and without the steady stream of patients.
Still, the drive to blame something other than chance is a strong one, and the issue arose again last week when a long-awaited study of breast cancer on Long Island did not find evidence that certain pesticides, exhaust fumes, or cigarette smoke were linked to cancer. The $8 million study, which was financed by Dr. Winn's group at the National Cancer Institute, came into being because local advocates had pressured Congress to approve it. When earlier studies found that breast cancer rates in Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island were about 3 percent higher than the national average, advocates were certain that this new study would find a smoking gun in the environment. Instead, scientists said, the investigation raised questions about what sort of assurances research like this can really provide. Geri Barish, the president of 1 in 9: The Long Island Breast Cancer Action Coalition, said that she knows that the pollutants studied are dangerous -- they cause cancer in laboratory animals, she said. ''How could they absolutely say that a known carcinogen is not absolutely involved in the cause of cancer?'' she asked.
But in 1994, the government changed its rules regulating the conduct of research on humans, saying patients could be enrolled under so-called waived consent as long as the community at large was notified that the experiment was under way and family members, having been told of it once they were found, were allowed to remove patients from it. Some researchers hesitated to participate under the new rules, and Dr. Clifton ended up with nine medical centers in the study. Dr. Cheung, of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said she was unaware of any other federally financed study in traumatic brain injury that had taken place under the waived consent regulations. For legal and ethical reasons, waived consent is ''an area where universities are concerned that they not make a mistake,'' Dr. Cheung explained. ''The easier thing is not to do the research.'' Even the requirement that communities be informed was problematic, she said.
But it is also the case that most patients want most of the information most of the time. In those cases where patients ask, I will tell them. I will say, ''Most patients with a disease like yours live about three months, although I have seen exceptions.'' And I promise them that I will not abandon them. Most patients want to be reassured that even if they are going to die, they still will be cared for.  Q. In an ideal world, doctors would be able to give accurate prognoses and they would know how to tell patients what to expect from their disease. But, in the meantime, patients are left in a quandary. They may want better prognoses, but how can they get them? Is there anything they can do?  A. It's difficult for me to advocate for these things because I fundamentally believe it is the job of a doctor. But assuming that we accept the reality that maybe things aren't as good as they should be, what can patients do?
The cache of letters had lain unnoticed in a locked drawer of a battered wooden box that looks like the slanted top of a lectern. It had been tucked into a corner of a vault on the second floor of the old brick building that houses the college. In June, needing storage space, Mr. Greifenstein decided it was time to throw the box away. He asked Leroy Green, the facilities foreman, to remove it. ''I was about to put it in the Dumpster, but I heard items moving around inside,'' Mr. Green said. He decided to break the lock on the drawer and investigate. To his astonishment, he saw a packet of yellowed papers tied with a string. The 85 documents, dated from 1787 to 1889, included medical case studies, articles, meteorological data and letters. They are originals, Mr. Greifenstein concluded, after examining them and consulting other experts in the months since they were found. And the ones discussing the yellow fever epidemic seem eerily timely now, when the nation is reeling from anthrax attacks.
William Vodra, a former F.D.A.  lawyer now working for the Washington law firm Arnold &amp; Porter, said drug companies are used to getting agency approval and have entire staffs whose job it is to make sure the job gets done. Universities have no such resources, Mr. Vodra said, which could make it very hard to comply with F.D.A. regulations. ''If the F.D.A. holds their feet to the fire, I think it's going to be a major disruption to academic research,'' he said. ''The universities don't have the infrastructure.'' Hopkins officials said there was confusion about when to seek the agency's approval. In 1997, the head of the ethics board at the medical center, which approves research using human subjects, sent a letter describing a hypothetical situation involving the application or inhalation of naturally occurring substances, like the hormone bradykinin. Was F.D.A. approval necessary for such studies, he asked. Two years later, the F.D.A. said that the question was complicated and that the agency was working on a reply. The university tried again to get an answer on April 19 of this year, but got no reply.
Finally, the man spoke up. ''He said: 'I've had enough. It's time to stop,' '' Dr. Lauer said. ''He knew exactly what that meant.'' The doctors turned off the man's defibrillator. Shortly afterward, he died. Defibrillator storms, as doctors call the condition the patient was experiencing, are still rare. Still they create a painful predicament that is expected to become more common with results from a study released last week. The study suggested that implantable defibrillators may improve survival rates in millions of heart patients. But what happens when an advance that prolongs life also prolongs a patient's misery? The device, which costs $20,000, plus $10,000 for the operation to insert it, is already approved for people (including Vice President Dick Cheney) who have heart rhythm disturbances that can be corrected by electric shocks to the heart. About 80,000 Americans have the devices, and since 1996, when they were approved for patients like Mr. Cheney, their use has been increasing by about 50 percent a year.
That normally occurs after about five days, when the embryo becomes a sphere with a ball of stem cells inside. Most of the company's embryos died without dividing even once, although one made it to an amorphous clump of six cells. In animals where cloning has succeeded, it remains very inefficient, often requiring 100 or more eggs to get a single viable clone. Finally, researchers must get replacement cells derived from stem cells to integrate into the body's complex machinery and fill in the blanks left by diseased or dying cells. That task may pose its own problems, as scientists found when they tried to supply fetal brain cells to patients with Parkinson's disease. In some patients, the fetal cells apparently grew too well. They pumped out too much of the brain chemicals, and there was no way to remove the cells or turn them off. But these cautionary findings were seldom mentioned when advocacy groups for patients with various disease took up the cause, even though  researchers expressed little optimism for cures any time soon, if ever. The task of getting stem cells to develop into specialized nerve cells and then getting those cells to repair the damage in the disease is well beyond today's science, experts say.
In the meantime, the results are challenging some long-held beliefs. Doctors and patients have assumed, for example, that small tumors are more treatable. The idea was that as tumors grow, they acquire mutations that enable them to spread throughout the body. But the study, and smaller studies that looked at genetic signatures of other cancers, indicate that tumor size may be beside the point. Most tumors, the studies indicate, appear to be potentially deadly or not from the very start. Doctors have also long assumed that after surgery, to be safe, they should treat virtually every breast cancer patient with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation, based on the belief that it is very difficult to differentiate women who will be helped by additional treatment from those who do not need it. The study indicates that it may soon be possible to make that distinction and that in the future, many women will be told that chemotherapy is not necessary.
But now, Inamed, a company that specializes in aesthetics, says it has more than enough data to persuade the drug agency to let it sell silicone breast implants in the United States. If the agency agrees, the implants will join the company's roster of appearance-enhancing products, like collagen to fill in facial wrinkles and a band that can be surgically implanted around the stomach to help obese people lose weight. The drug agency has asked panel members not to discuss the data before the meeting, but it has posted on its Web site the questions members will be addressing. In essence, the issue before them is: what safety data suffice to bring back a device whose purpose, for many women, would be to enhance their appearance, not to treat a disease or correct a medical condition? The panel will also ask whether there should be a different standard for women who want breast reconstruction, not simply larger breasts.
''I am afraid,'' Ms. Kipfer said -- afraid of fractured bones if she stops taking the hormones, afraid of breast cancer if she continues. ''If I was taking it for hot flashes, I would come right off,'' she said. But what about osteoporosis? For the 16,000 healthy women in the Women's Health Initiative study on combination hormone therapy, the decision was clear. Investigators informed them on Tuesday that they were to stop taking the pills, estrogen and progestin, immediately. The study had been stopped because the drugs' risks had been found to outweigh their benefits. According to the data, if 10,000 women took the drugs for a year and 10,000 did not, women in the first group would have 8 more cases of invasive breast cancer, 7 more heart attacks, 8 more strokes and 18 more instances of blood clots. But there would be 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures.
The fatal illness probably was precipitated, university officials said, when Ms. Roche took a drug in the study. The study was conducted at the center where she worked, but not by the researcher she worked for. She was healthy, and the study was not intended to help her personally. Volunteers were paid up to $365 for their time and effort. While stressing that they might never know why Ms. Roche became so ill and died, the medical center's internal committee wrote in its report that they believed the drug she took ''was either solely responsible for the subject's illness or played an important contributory role.'' The report is being submitted to the federal Office of Human Research Protection. ''This was a horrible tragedy,'' said Dr. Miller at a solemn news conference today to release the medical center's report. Dr. Miller said another committee, of experts from outside the university, was also investigating and would issue its report by late summer.
Dr. Berry has a different view of cancer prevention centers. For now, while research continues, perhaps their greatest value to healthy people is not so much in giving them ways to prevent cancer but in showing them that their fears of getting cancer may be exaggerated and that if they do develop cancer, it usually is not because they did something wrong. ''The person in the street greatly exaggerates their risk of cancer,'' Dr. Berry said. One thing a cancer prevention center can do, he said, is let people know their real risk and the real effect of measures that many think will give them cancer, or protect them from it. ''We can be letting them know that changing their lifestyle may change their risks, but not by much,'' Dr. Berry said. ''We can be letting them know that while hormone therapy may increase the risk of breast cancer, it does not increase it much.''
The program that helped Mr. Littlefield shows what is possible, Dr. McClellan said. ''For people who doubt that these kinds of care improvement programs can have an impact on health care costs, this is pretty convincing evidence that they can.'' The Whatcom County project began in 2001, focusing on chronic illnesses, which account for more than 75 percent of all medical expenses in the nation. The planners asked patients to join the conversation. ''That changed everything,'' said Dr. Marc Pierson, the project executive and an administrator at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Hospital in Bellingham. They heard from people like Rebecca Bryson, a 47-year-old Bellingham resident with congestive heart failure and diabetes. She saw 14 doctors and took 42 medications. Ms. Bryson said that the burden was on her to keep everyone informed of her medications and complications, and that she always worried she had forgotten something. Just getting a doctor's appointment could be an effort.
A growing body of research is leading many medical experts to ask whether more is really better when it comes to health care. Some medical specialties and geographical areas are suffering from a glut of doctors and hospitals, these experts say. Supply seems to drive demand. More hospitals in an area mean many more days spent in hospitals with no discernible improvements in health. More medical specialists mean many more specialist visits and procedures. ''If there are twice as many physicians, patients will come in for twice as many visits,'' said Dr. John E. Wennberg of Dartmouth Medical School, where much of the new work is being done. The Dartmouth researchers acknowledge that their findings are unexpected, and some experts say more work is needed to sort out cause from effect. ''These relationships are very difficult to disentangle,'' said Dr. Rodney Hayward, professor of health policy and management at the University of Michigan. Patients in some regions may be demanding more care, either because they are sicker or because they have come to expect it, Dr. Hayward said; doctors cluster in areas where there is more demand.
Even the acting director of the largest of the new randomized trials of hormone replacement, the Hormone Replacement Therapy Trial of the National Institutes of Health's Women's Health Initiative, expected the two types of studies to agree. ''I was quite surprised,'' said the official, Dr. Jacques E. Rossouw, who is at the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Hormone replacement ''may be something of a classic.'' It will be ''taught in the future to illustrate the pitfalls'' of relying on observational studies to reveal the truth. Yet despite their generally exalted status in medicine, randomized studies have been wrong, said Dr. Richard Peto, an epidemiologist at Oxford University in England. Small randomized studies, Dr. Peto said, concluded that vitamin E protected against heart disease, as did large observational studies. It was only very recently, when the question was studied with a randomized study involving 50,000 people that the truth emerged, he said, adding, ''Vitamin E does not work.''
Conventional wisdom has it that anyone who really wants to become fit can do so. Just walk or ride a bicycle, swim or run. Speed and endurance will improve and what was once hard will become easy. Lift weights, work with a trainer in a gym, and muscles will grow larger and stronger. But when a few intrepid scientists began asking if those beliefs were true, they found that fitness, like weight loss, has genetic underpinnings, making it inherently much easier for some to get fit than it is for others. And the facets of fitness are independent, so those who inherit an ability to gain muscle strength may not be able to grow large muscles and those who can easily increase their ability to do aerobic exercise may be thwarted on the weight room floor. Now, having garnered convincing evidence that genes determine a person's abilities at athletic training, scientists are conducting large and rigorous studies to track down the particular genes, and genetic variants, involved.
William Vodra, a Washington drug lawyer who was associate chief counsel at the F.D.A. from 1974 to 1979, applauded that initiative. ''He's latched onto what is probably of largest concern to the pharmaceutical industry,'' Mr. Vodra said. ''If it works, it will benefit everybody, with a faster time from test tube to patients and lower cost of research and development.'' Dr. Bruce Burlington, who is vice president for quality and regulatory affairs at Wyeth, said the drug plan ''offers a clear benefit'' to companies. But Dr. Burlington, who spent 17 years at the F.D.A. before going to Wyeth four years ago, added, ''Announcing an initiative is one piece, but then you have to carry through with it.'' Dr. Carl Peck, a former director of the agency's center for drug development who now directs Georgetown University's Center for Drug Development Science, also thought the idea was good, but cautioned that companies might not respond.
Many women worried about silicone leaking out of their implants, migrating through their bodies. But the company reported that surgeons in its study saw no silicone outside the tissue surrounding 162 implants that were removed, even in the 26 implants that had ruptured. Another concern is silent ruptures -- devices that break, unknown to a woman. Silent ruptures can be seen with M.R.I.'s, which found that there was a 2.7 percent risk over three years. That is a major issue, said Dr. Sahar M. Dawisha, an analyst at the F.D.A. who addressed the group. She noted that Inamed's M.R.I. study involved only a subset of its patients. ''You will be asked to address the adequacy of the rupture rate information,'' she told the advisory panel. Then there is the reoperation rate. Inamed's study found that within two years, 21 percent of the women who had implants for augmentation were operated on again to repair complications. The same was true for 34 percent who had them to replace a previous implant, and 46 percent of cancer patients who had implants for breast reconstruction.
Now scientists have found a handful of genes that can lead to Alzheimer's disease. The question for Mr. Pierce is, Should he be tested to find out if he has one of them? He has decided not to after speaking to a doctor who told him: ''When it comes to being tested, I always point out that there has to be some reason to be tested. If you believe that you'd live your life differently, then there might be some reason to be tested.'' With no way of preventing the disease, and the fear of genetic discrimination lurking, Mr. Pierce thinks he is better off not knowing. ''The one thing that was remarkable to me is that the scientists are throwing this stuff way out ahead of the legal system, cultural mores, all kinds of things,'' Mr. Pierce said in a recent interview. ''I'm not sure we've done enough to catch up.''
IT is a question that occurs to almost everyone who becomes seriously ill: Should you go to your local hospital or would you do better if you went to a major medical center? It may mean a long trip when you are ill and it will almost certainly mean seeing doctors who are strangers to you. But what if going to a major medical center makes the difference between life and death? Patients reach different conclusions, based often on gut feelings about a doctor or a hospital. And medical researchers, looking for data, say they are not always certain themselves about how to decide. ''There really is very, very little information,'' says Dr. Elliott S. Fisher, a professor at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, N.H., who studies medical outcomes. ''It's the great weakness of all the efforts to foster consumer engagement in health care decision making.'' But there are a few hints, he and others say, and the answers from the studies so far have sometimes been a surprise.
In both cases, the investigators found, patients at community hospitals fared at least as well as those at academic medical centers. With pneumonia, for example, patients are supposed to receive antibiotics within four hours of being admitted to the hospital. ''If you go to a community hospital, you had a 72 percent chance of getting your antibiotics within four hours of hitting the door,'' Dr. Lindenauer said. ''If you go to the large teaching hospital, you have a 56 percent chance.'' ''Our study wasn't able to answer why,'' Dr. Lindenauer added, but he said he has a hunch. ''A routine case of pneumonia may not command all of the resources and personnel of the emergency room in the way it might in a community hospital.'' The study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease came to the same conclusion: The hospitals that took care of more of these patients really did no better than the hospitals that took care of fewer, he said.
A person with normal memory may falter, but given a hint (for example, that one of the words was a color) might reply, ''Oh, yes, a red Oldsmobile with a cabbage inside.'' But a person with mild cognitive impairment is not helped by hints, said Dr. Jeffrey Cummings, director of the Alzheimer's Disease Center at the University of California at Los Angeles, ''because the memory was never stored.'' People with Alzheimer's disease are much more impaired. They may have trouble interpreting what they are reading or writing a grammatically correct sentence. They have trouble concentrating, reasoning and doing simple math problems. They have trouble in their daily lives, often getting lost when they drive a car. Alzheimer's can also rob patients of self-insight -- the ability to recognize what is wrong with them. Many medical investigators believe that this is a consequence of deterioration in the cells in the brain's temporal lobe, where insights are formed.
To answer it, he said, ''we would have to do a different kind of trial.'' It would maintain the estradiol levels of youth, which start to drop at about 45. The women would be younger, and the estradiol, which cannot be taken in a pill, would be in a patch or nasal spray. One thing is clear: scientists cannot ignore the question. Many women need hormone therapy Dr. Rossouw said. ''We can't walk away from it,'' he said. ''Women will continue to take it. A third of women get moderate to severe symptoms of menopause, and there really is no other option.'' In the meantime, he said, ''the No. 1 research priority'' is to discover why the women in the health initiative had more heart attacks. ''What's the mechanism?'' Dr. Rossouw asked. ''If we can find it, maybe we can find drugs that don't trigger it. ''We've got to go back to the drawing board.''
''It was a very unreal, bizarre situation,'' he added. ''I had never seen anything like it.'' He thought of the 1918 flu, one of the worst epidemics in history, which killed an estimated 40 million to 100 million people around the world in a single flu season. The virus of 1997 seemed gone for good after Hong Kong's chickens, nearly a million in all, were slaughtered. But it returned in chickens there this year, a development that led to a culling of them in May. Since then, said Dr. Robert Webster, a leading flu expert at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, it has come back yet again in the chickens, which are shipped from China. ''It's just going to be impossible to clean all this up,'' said Dr. Taubenberger, of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. In the meantime, the University of Wisconsin researchers were analyzing strains of the H5N1 virus from 1997. The investigators, Dr. Yoshihiro Kawaoka, Dr. Masato Hatta and colleagues, took advantage of an unusual feature of the virus: While most human flu viruses do not make mice ill, these strains generally affected mice and people in the same way. Those that killed people killed mice, in both cases spreading from the lungs to the brain and other organs. But other H5N1 strains that appeared in Hong Kong at the same time did not kill people or mice, and remained in the lungs.
It may be that a law of large numbers is what made cloning work in other species, she and other experts said. After all, Dr. Dominko used 300 monkey eggs in three years. That, said Dr. Ray Page, a colleague at Advanced Cell Technology, ''is a bad experiment on a bad day in a cow lab.'' Researchers get thousands of cow eggs from slaughterhouses, Dr. Page said. That makes it much easier to try cloning often enough, with enough slight variations in technique, that it eventually works. Dr. Page said he learned this from bitter experience at a Blacksburg, Va., laboratory where he worked for a biotechnology company, PPL Therapeutics, trying to clone cattle and pigs. The group finally succeeded, Dr. Page said, but only after thousands of frustrating attempts. ''None of us expected it to take so long.'' ''That's the history of cloning,'' Dr. Page said. When it finally works, no one really knows why. ''For some reason things just seem to click.''
Her oral surgeon, Ms. McDevitt said, ''cut into the jaw -- he cut and filed the bone down.'' It did not help. ''I had horrible sores back there,'' she said, ''ungodly painful sores. I was in agony. I had never had anything like that in my life.'' Ms. McDevitt is now no better. ''I still can't eat on that side of my mouth,'' she said. ''The skin is really thin, and it's still sore.'' Her oral surgeon never mentioned osteonecrosis, but her doctor's partner figured it out. She stopped taking the bisphosphonate. ''Hopefully it will heal,'' Ms. McDevitt said. ''It's pretty scary.''
''The same people who today are trying to make claims that they are not responsible for a crime they committed because they heard a song on TV or that they are not responsible for their obesity because they ate at McDonald's will be making genetic arguments,'' Dr. Stock said. Dr. Todd Golub, director of cancer genomics at the Whitehead Institute Center for Genome Research in Cambridge, Mass., predicts fundamental change in a different arena, the pharmaceutical industry. Today, for example, doctors treat cancer patients without knowing, in most cases, whether a person's tumor can respond or resist. Some tumors shrivel and die. Others are impervious to drugs. With genetic insights, scientists will be able to predict which drugs will destroy a particular tumor. Researchers will be able to design a variety of drugs, each tailored to particular genetic patterns. But what happens when diseases like breast cancer, heart disease or Alzheimer's, all in some sense blanket diagnoses that cover similar effects from different causes, are subdivided into more narrowly described ailments based on highly specific and varying genetic patterns?
Attempts to decide which operation is better have been plagued by small studies with limited information and different designs, making their results difficult to compare, experts agree. But that may change, with the study at Veterans Affairs hospitals. The study, costing $10 million, began last year and is expected to end in 2007, directed by Dr. Frederick L. Grover, chairman of the department of surgery at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. It will involve 2,200 patients at 17 V.A. hospitals. ''I'm fairly unbiased,'' Dr. Grover said. ''We don't know which is better.''
Dr. Creinin said he told doctors about the office visits a woman must make, the counseling a doctor must do, the backup medical services that must be provided and the state laws that must be followed. ''When you go through everything, they just say, 'Oh no. This is a lot more complicated than I thought. I have to think about it,' '' Dr. Creinin said. ''Most doctors who answer surveys saying they are interested in offering this, change their minds when you tell them what's involved.'' One survey of gynecologists and family practice doctors, conducted by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, found that about a third said that they would at least consider  prescribing mifepristone. But, said Tina Hoff, a spokeswoman for the foundation, doctors often had no idea of what it meant to offer the drug, and when they found out, many backed off. People have looked at the decision by the Food and Drug Administration to allow the pill as a pinnacle, Ms. Hoff said. ''But in many ways it isn't the final answer.''
For Dr. Herman-Giddens, and many others who share her concerns, the findings pointed to a terrible problem. ''There's something in our lifestyle, our environment,'' she said. ''It's a serious public health issue, and I think it should be addressed.'' It did not take long, some pediatric endocrinologists said, before they were seeing distraught parents whose doctors had reassured them that it was normal for their 6-year-olds to start sexual development. ''A patient I saw shortly after the paper had been seen by a family practitioner,'' said Dr. Ora H. Pescovitz, a pediatrics professor at the Indiana University School of Medicine. ''She was 7 years old.'' The child's doctor had read the paper by Dr. Herman-Giddens and thought it was ''normal for a child that age to have puberty and he did not refer her,'' Dr. Pescovitz said. The girl had a type of brain tumor  that caused her early puberty.
FOR a nation that spends more than any other on health, the United States certainly doesn't seem very healthy. Many cancers are on the rise -- prostate, breast, skin, thyroid. We're fatter than ever. As for diabetes, the number of people who say they have it has doubled in the last 10 years. Now a report says that the British -- those smoking, candy-eating, fish-and-chips lovers -- are actually healthier than Americans. And they spend half as much on health care. The American-British comparison, published this month in The Journal of the American Medical Association, analyzed data from people's own reports of their health and also used some objective measures: a blood test for diabetes, using hemoglobin A1c, and blood tests for proteins associated with heart disease risk, fibrinogen and C-reactive. Their blunt conclusion? ''Americans are much sicker than the English,'' wrote the investigators, led by Dr. Michael Marmot of University College Medical School in London.
A new study finds that virtual colonoscopy, a method that uses a C.T. scanner for colon cancer screening, can be just as effective as traditional colonoscopy in finding polyps, the mushroomlike growths from which most cancers arise. Patients having the 15-minute virtual screening test simply lie down and hold their breath for about 10 seconds, exhale, then hold their breath again while a C.T. scanner X-rays their colons, creating detailed, three-dimensional images of the walls. With traditional colonoscopy, patients are sedated while a doctor threads a long flexible tube into the colon, spending half an hour viewing its walls in much the same sort of detail. Then they wait in a recovery room for about an hour as the sedative wears off. With virtual colonoscopy, said Dr. Perry J. Pickhardt, a radiology professor at the University of Wisconsin and director of the new study, ''it is as though you are flying through this virtual reality.'' As the doctor watches the screen, ''the polyps pop up,'' he said. ''It's as though you're doing a regular colonoscopy.''
The researchers who published their findings in Nature Genetics were led by Dr. Charles D. Boyd of the University of Hawaii and Dr. Arthur A. B. Bergen of the Netherlands Ophthalmic Research Institute in Amsterdam. The scientist who published in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences is Dr. Jouni Uitto of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Dr. Uitto, who is a professor and chairman of the department of dermatology and cutaneous biology at Jefferson, proposes that when mutations disable the ABCC6 gene, toxic compounds accumulate in the body and attach themselves to elastic tissue in the skin, in blood vessels and in a membrane behind the retina. Ms. Terry said her next goal was for scientists to analyze the different mutations that could disable the ABCC6 gene to learn the reasons for the various manifestations in different people. ''We want to find a way to slow the disease down,'' she said. ''Our goal is to cure the disease.''
Others did too. ''It certainly doesn't augur well for the future,'' said Dr. Steven N. Blair, who is director of research at the Cooper Institute in Dallas, a nonprofit foundation that studies exercise and health. He worries about the long-term health effects of such a sedentary life, especially in view of data indicating that women who get even a moderate amount of exercise have significantly less heart disease than those who are inactive. Those data were reported in the same issue of The New England Journal, in a paper by Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, the chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and her colleagues. Their study involved 73,743 women ages 50 to 79; of them, more than 12,000 were nonwhite. Those who walked briskly for at least two and a half hours a week had 30 percent less heart disease than those who were less active, the researchers report. More exercise was slightly better in terms of health, but almost all of the benefit was achieved simply by going from being sedentary to walking briskly for 30 minutes a day, or doing an equal amount of some other exercise, five days a week.
''I will tell you, I was pretty shocked,'' Ms. Schlesinger said. ''I looked up this thing they thought I had and I saw things like, 'survival rates.' '' She turned out not to have the disease. But partly because of her doctor's dismissive remarks, she also ended up changing physicians. In interviews, doctors and patients say the Internet has profoundly changed their relationships. With an estimated 100,000 medical Web sites, patients can look up any disease, drug or medical condition in seconds. When a doctor so much as mentions a possible diagnosis, many patients rush to their computers to learn more about it. When a doctor suggests a drug, patients go online to find its side effects. And when they arrive at their doctor's office, more and more patients are bearing pages of information printed from Web sites. ''It's a massive revolution,'' said Dr. Rita Charon, a specialist in internal medicine at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. ''It altogether shifts what goes on when a patient comes in with pages of downloaded stuff and half the time the doctor looking at it has never seen it before. There's a whole new set of emotions present.''
An embryo created by cloning would be an exact genetic match of the person whose cells were used to make it. Its stem cells and any mature cells derived from those stem cells would exactly match the cells in the person's body, making them perfect replacement cells. One of the four part-time researchers at the Harvard lab, Dr. Kevin Eggan, learned to clone mice as a Ph.D. student at M.I.T. and, he said, the group is seeking approval from Harvard's ethics committee to try to start the cloning process with human cells. The federal government forbids the use of its money to pay for such research, but this lab, directed by Dr. Douglas A. Melton, a Harvard developmental biologist, takes no federal money. Instead, the work is paid for by the Howard Hughes Foundation, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation and the Naomi Berry Diabetes Center of Columbia University. Cloning, however, can be onerous. In February, researchers in South Korea announced that they gotten stem cells from human embryos they created by cloning, but they began with 176 human eggs and ended up with one embryo that yielded stem cells.
Researchers reported that breast cancer rates, which had been inching up since 1945, suddenly took a sharp turn downward in 2003, the most recent year for which national data was available. They declined 7 percent over all, and by more than twice that rate -- 15 percent -- in the 7 in 10 women whose tumors were fed by estrogen. The researchers said the most likely reason for the sudden decline was that the 2002 study prompted many women to stop taking hormones or never to start them. ''If that's all the time it takes for H.R.T. to do that kind of damage,'' Ms. Raymond said, using the abbreviation for hormone replacement therapy, ''someone ought to sit up and take note.'' She wishes she had never taken the drugs. It may be that they had nothing to do with her cancer. But what if they caused it? Across the country, reactions to the new report varied from fury to disbelief to a kind of complacency, a feeling of ''what else is new?'' Some women say they are glad they never took the drugs; others are saying that they cannot do without them and will just have to accept the risk.
''In most cases, one of the major reasons for doing a systematic evaluation is to determine what is actually going on and to provide some real information, rather than rumors.''
Though the antibiotic Cipro has become the drug of choice among people worried about anthrax, several other widely available and less expensive antibiotics are very likely to work as well. Cipro was approved last year in the United States specifically to prevent the inhaled form of anthrax, the most lethal form of the disease, which can be contracted by people who inhale anthrax spores deep into their lungs. The sole death in the current outbreak of bioterrorism was caused by inhaled anthrax. But two other classes of antibiotics, penicillins and tetracyclines, had already been approved to treat anthrax generally, including cutaneous anthrax, a less deadly disease that can be caused when the spores contact a break in the skin, and gastrointestinal anthrax, which is contracted from eating infected meat. All three forms are caused by the same microbe, Bacillus anthracis, and scientists say they believe that all the drugs could work equally well. They are best used before symptoms occur.
Dr. John D. Minna, the director of the Hamon Center for Therapeutic Oncology Research at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, said he was struck by the fact that the cancer genes apparently could not act alone but needed telomerase to change a normal cell into a cancerous one. That means, he said, that by looking for telomerase, it might be possible to decide when a benign mass of cells is about to turn cancerous, aiding in the early detection of cancer. He had thought before of using telomerase as a possible early marker for cancer, Dr. Minna said, but had put it on the back burner. ''This brings it to the front burner,'' he said.
But as case reports began to trickle in, Novartis put a warning of the condition on the drugs' labels, even before the F.D.A. required it, and appointed an advisory board, which included Dr. Ruggiero. In the meantime, Dr. Ruggiero and others had noticed something new: osteoporosis patients taking bisphosphonate pills who had developed osteonecrosis of the jaw. In 2004, he published a report on 63 patients -- 56 with cancer, the rest with osteoporosis. Still, the number of reported cases remains tiny. A recent article in The Annals of Internal Medicine reviews the published papers. They include reports of osteonecrosis in 388 cancer patients; 3 patients with Paget's disease, a degenerative bone disorder treated with oral bisphosphonates; and 15 with osteoporosis. The authors of that article, led by Dr. Sook-Bin Woo of the School of Dental Medicine at Harvard, estimated the risk for cancer patients taking intravenous drugs at 6 to 10 percent. The risk for osteoporosis patients, taking the lower doses, is unknown, they said.
Dr. Robins also said that at highly competitive colleges, any advantage, even 30 or 40 points in an SAT score, could make a difference between being accepted and being rejected.
''For the estrogen receptor negatives,'' he said, ''there is a very dramatic improvement with chemotherapy. The vast majority of those women, except for those with the tiniest tumors or those with other health problems who would be expected to live only a few more years, should receive a course of chemotherapy.'' As for those with tumors fueled by estrogen, however, ''we have a big challenge,'' Dr. Winer said. ''We know that on average the benefit is less, but there are clearly women who benefit'' from chemotherapy. ''The challenge is to identify them,'' he said. There are tests of how sensitive a tumor is to estrogen, but, Dr. Winer said, they ''are not as reliable as we all would like.'' There is also a gene test, the Genomic Health/Nsabp recurrence score, that looks at 21 genes and is correlated with a tumor's response to estrogen and response to chemotherapy. But, he said, ''it too is not ready for general use.''
It should be no surprise to viewers of the hit movie ''Erin Brockovich'' that the science portrayed in the movie is not really science. After all, this is a major motion picture coming out of Hollywood. It comes from a fairy tale land where women are abnormally beautiful, men are lusciously handsome, where sex is unusually profligate and violence casual and frequent. So if audiences are willing to suspend disbelief in every other arena, why should anyone care about something so dull as the veracity of the scientific methodology? Yet many scientists are offended by the movie, and it is worth asking why. The problem, they say, is not that they cannot enjoy a good yarn in which virtue triumphs over evil and the little guys win. It is not that they want to take sides in this litigation from years past. Their complaint is more subtle: While it is easy to see that the sex and violence in movies are fantasies, it is hard for any but scientists to discern when science in movies crosses the line from verity to hyperbole and indoctrination.
''We felt like we needed to go to the big guns,'' the woman said. ''We felt like we were going to see the great and powerful Oz.'' Two more cycles and another miscarriage later, the couple made a wrenching decision to give up on ''a baby that was genetically both of ours'' and to explore donor eggs. In late winter, they had a baby. The final cost: $80,000. ''We live very modestly,'' the woman said. ''We live with garage-sale furniture, and my husband drives a 10-year-old car.'' Still, she added, in the same situation ''we would do it all over again.'' As for Ms. Todd, she wants a baby girl and so she is planning another pregnancy attempt. Looking back on the years and the money she spent, she said, she never expected what she went through. But once she started she could not stop. ''You put your nose to the grindstone. And you focus on the next step,'' she said.
''I've met with two groups who said they fear the results will take away their practice,'' Dr. Weinstein said. ''I don't know how to deal with that. I don't know what the results will be.'' Back experts say it is clear that surgery can make some patients feel better immediately. ''Let's say you have a herniated disk and let's say you have leg pain and let's say you are as miserable as hell and you convince somebody to operate on you,'' said Dr. Michael Modic, chairman of the radiology department at the Cleveland Clinic. ''You have a 95 percent chance of waking up with no pain.'' Most people will get better anyway, Dr. Modic said, but surgery can ''reduce the symptomatic time period.'' Dr. Thomas Errico, president of the North American Spine Society, says surgery is a last resort. His patients have X-rays or M.R.I.'s. They try over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drugs. They are given an exercise program, or get muscle relaxants or painkilling injections. They are told to stretch and to get their weight under control. They might get a steroid injected into the spine to reduce inflammation.
The result, reported in 2001, was that 7 percent of the study participants were frail -- they had three or more of the frailty indicators -- and the incidence of frailty increased rapidly with age. Just 3 percent of the people aged 65 to 69 were frail, but 20 to 30 percent of those aged 80 or older were considered so. Last year, the investigators reported that those who had started down the path to frailty, with one or two signs, were likely to develop the full-blown syndrome soon. Once someone was frail, he had a twofold to fourfold increased risk of falling, becoming disabled or dying in the next three years. Frailty, said Dr. Fried, ''is a high-risk condition.'' But if frailty is an independent disease, the researchers asked, what underlies it? They looked for biochemical abnormalities in the blood, and, in a paper published on Nov. 11 in The Archives of Internal Medicine, they reported that frailty was associated with increased levels of three proteins that are linked to chronic inflammation, a sort of low-grade response to an infection or irritation of body tissues.
''Counting deaths is not an exact science,'' Dr. Stroup said. For now, said Dr. Dixie Snider, the disease control centers' chief science officer, the agency will not take a position on what is the true number of deaths from obesity and overweight. ''We're too early in the science,'' Dr. Snider said. Dr. Stroup said of the new findings, ''From a scientific point of view, they are a step forward.'' But she added that the agency considered illness that is linked to obesity to be just as important as the number of deaths. ''Mortality really only represents the tip of the iceberg of the magnitude of the problem,'' she said. Estimating deaths due to overweight or obesity is a statistical challenge, the study's investigators said. The idea is to determine, for each person in the population, what would be the risk of dying if that person's weight were normal. For people whose weight is already in that range, there would be no change in the risk, of course. But what happens to the risk for people whose weight is above or below the normal range? The idea is to control for factors like age, smoking and gender, and ask what would happen if only the weight were changed.
The resulting method yielded blastocysts 26 percent of the time. ''That's amazing,'' Dr. Sch√∂ler said. Eventually, Dr. Hwang, Dr. Moon and their colleagues ended up with 30 blastocysts, from which they were able to extract 20 inner cell masses. One grew into a line of stem cells. The next step, Dr. Sch√∂ler said, will be to improve the success rate of obtaining stem cell lines from blastocysts. Dr. Ron McKay, a stem cell scientist at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said the work suggested that it might be easier than anyone thought to make cloned human embryos and extract stem cells from them. ''The next question takes you to the heart of the whole discussion,'' Dr. McKay said. ''Why do it anyway? What's the point? Is there any point?'' Dr. McKay said that for him the point was that such cells could provide a unique opportunity to study human disease. He spoke of a scientist who had died in her 40's from breast cancer. What if her cells had been cloned to make embryonic stem cells and those cells had been directed to turn into breast tissue? That might give scientists a chance to examine how genes for breast cancer altered the cells' susceptibility and might explain how and why the cancer developed in the first place.
The drug agency has a policy when pregnancy begins, said William Vodra, an expert on drug law at Arnold &amp; Porter, the Washington law firm. The policy dates from the 1970's, when Mr. Vodra was at the agency and considered special informed consents for pregnant women in clinical trials. The agency asked how to tell when a woman is pregnant, but there is no effective pregnancy test before implantation. It has been the policy, Mr. Vodra said, that pregnancy begins at implantation. The final decision will be up to Food and Drug Commissioner Mark B. McClellan. ''We told him that women were counting on him to use his leadership to keep the agency on track and make decisions based on science,'' Cindy Pearson of the National Women's Health Network said. ''He said, of course, he understood. He was committed to science. He, of course, was noncommittal on any issue. But he was engaging and personable and relaxed and friendly and open. We never got any, 'I wish I didn't have to listen to you' vibes.''
''We had a big discussion about what to do,'' Dr. Schuelke said. ''We remembered the mighty mice and the Belgian Blue cattle. This child looked like that.'' The child's mother was strong -- she had been a professional sprinter in the 100-meter dash -- and she came from a strong family. Her grandfather, a construction worker, had unloaded curbstones by hand, hefting stones weighing at least 330 pounds. (There was no information on the baby's father.) So Dr. Schuelke and his colleagues decided to test the baby and his mother for mutations in the myostatin gene. The mother had one nonfunctioning copy of the gene. In the boy, both copies of the gene were inactive; he was making no myostatin at all. No other family members agreed to genetic testing. The findings, researchers say, may help scientists pin down why some people find it easy to get strong while others can lift weights day after day to little effect. At least some of this natural variation, they suspect, may be a result of individual differences in myostatin levels.
A decade or so ago, when the revolution in genetics was getting under way, the air was heady with promises. Gene tests, scientists predicted, would become an integral part of drug prescribing. No longer would patients find out too late that a drug did not work for them. No longer would they have to wait to see if they had side effects to one drug before switching to another. Tests of their genes would make all of this clear. But with the exception of a few tests for genes on certain cancer cells, the genetics revolution has not yet happened. There are many reasons. But the stories of two drugs -- one for heart failure, the other for breast cancer -- illuminate some of the difficulties as well as the immense promise that is still to come. Now maybe, just maybe, the promised revolution is imminent. ''We are sitting here on the edge of a very significant improvement'' in drug therapy, said Dr. David Flockhart, a professor of medicine, genetics and pharmacology at Indiana University. ''It involves no new drugs, no massive drug development program. It involves exploiting natural human variation to protect people from therapy when it will be useless.''
Others, like Dr. Alejandro Prieto of Michigan State University, said that the balloon did not deflate and that he had to use a sharp wire to pop it. But then he also punctured the patient's artery. ''Those are serious problems,'' said Dr. Schultz, who said the F.D.A. had received similar reports. But, he added, the agency does not know how often the problems occur or under what circumstances. Some incidents may be caused by doctor error, for example, or by using the devices in situations in which they are not recommended. Dr. Andrew Carter of Providence St. Vincent's Medical Center in Portland, Ore., said that while his medical center had used several hundred taxus stents without incident he was nonetheless worried. ''I have never had a balloon that did not deflate, or a device entrapment,'' he said, referring to balloons that got stuck on stents. ''You would never expect to see it. Period.''
Before long, the menopause drugs, and in particular Prempro, from Wyeth, a combination of estrogen and progestins, became one of the most popular drugs in history. The reversal of fortune came in July 2002 when the Women's Health Initiative was halted. Its accumulating data indicated that Prempro was associated with a slight increase in breast cancer and in heart attacks, strokes and blood clots. The drug slightly decreased the risk of hip fractures and colon cancer, but those benefits were not enough to overcome its risks, the researchers said. Health authorities cautioned that similar pills must be regarded as having the same risks as Prempro until proven otherwise. The very next year, 2003, the National Cancer Institute reported recently, there was a huge decline in breast cancer incidence. It was, Dr. Ravdin said, the largest decline for a single cancer in a single year that he was aware of. He and his colleagues wondered what was going on. The cancer kills an estimated 40,000 women a year and any decline in incidence can be important.
''There is no question that smoking affects the epidemic'' of obesity, said Dr. Neil Grunberg, a psychologist and neuroscientist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Md. Smokers who quit, he noted, gain about 10 to 12 pounds on average, in part because they crave sweet foods and carbohydrates. In addition, Dr. Grunberg said, smokers' metabolism slows down after they quit. Dr. Michael Grossman, an economist, and his colleagues at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York have analyzed the economic causes of obesity. They have calculated, based on cigarette tax receipts, that for every 10 percent increase in the price of cigarettes, the number of obese people rises 2 percent. Smoking cessation, they estimate, accounted for 20 percent of the obesity increase in this country. Dr. Katherine Flegal, a statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics, said the effect may be even bigger, once scientists add the upward effect on average weight of the growth in the number of Americans who, because of the success of the antismoking movement, never smoked in the first place.
But scientists say the process in which moles and molelike tumors start and then stop may be good news. It seems to be an important way for the body to stop cancers that can easily get going when a random mutation pushes a cell along that path. ''It is a fair guess to say that this mechanism protects us from cancer over and over again,'' Dr. Mooi says. ''Perhaps on a daily basis.'' It is not the only way to stop a cancer, but it must be a highly effective one given all the moles that many people have. In fact, it is so effective that melanomas very rarely, if ever, come from moles, Dr. Fisher said. Instead, they seem to come from other skin cells. Of course, few would have predicted that a cell could start along a path to cancer and then stop, and when scientists first suggested it, they were met with skepticism. Many researchers did not believe the effect was real. Most of those doubters have changed their minds, though, because new research shows that the phenomenon explains moles and similar tiny tumors that scientists recently found in human prostate glands. Now, scientists are saying that they want to develop cancer treatments that mimic the process. The goal is to deliberately force cancers back to the stage where their cells stopped dividing.
Dr. Kaplowitz said the old guidelines encouraged an over-medicalization of normal development. Parents of healthy girls are being told to give their child extensive medical tests and drugs to temporarily halt puberty, he said. He said he worried that the old guidelines labeled too many girls as abnormal. ''If we were to use the previous guidelines, about 8 percent of white girls and 26 percent of blacks would be considered to have precocious puberty,'' Dr. Kaplowitz said. Others pointed out that those estimates assumed that Dr. Herman-Giddens's figures were correct --  and they question her data. Medical abnormalities are not the only issue, they emphasize, saying that girls may be unprepared for puberty at such early ages. ''Put yourself in the position of a first grader who is developing breasts or pubic hair,'' Dr. Saenger said. ''It's not normal.'' Increasingly distressed, a group of eight experts, including Dr. Saenger, Dr. Bachrach, Dr. Pescovitz and Dr. Rosenfield, wrote a letter, published in Pediatrics last September, saying that girls should be evaluated ''when breast or pubic hair appear before 8 or 9 years of age respectively, regardless of race.''
One woman who had been taking the hormones for four years said her biggest worry was heart disease. ''She said: 'I know what it's like to come off it. I'm going to feel terrible,' '' Dr. Utian said. Then she asked him what the actual risks were. He pulled out Table 4 from the publication of the study data in The Journal of the American Medical Association. In Year 4, he told her, 25 women taking hormones had heart attacks, compared with 24 taking a placebo; the risk was low. ''Table 4 is going to be on my desk from now on,'' Dr. Utian said. Another woman had taken the drugs for about the same amount of time. She was at high risk for colon cancer and osteoporosis. ''Her risk-to-benefit ratio turns out to be favorable if I keep her on it,'' he said. A third woman had started taking the drugs to reduce her risk of heart disease. ''I told her I don't see any reason to stay on them,'' he said.
''It's really not about preventing heart attacks per se,'' said Paul LaViolette, a senior vice president at Boston Scientific, a stent manufacturer. ''The obvious purpose of the procedure is palliation and symptom relief. It's a quality-of-life gain.''
DR. WINN points to the study, which examined blood and urine from more than 3,000 Long Island women for evidence of exposure to DDT, PCB's, chlordanes or chemicals from cigarette smoke. The scientists also looked at carpet dust, tap water and yard soil for evidence that the chemicals were in the women's environment. But those who got breast cancer were no more likely to have been exposed to the chemicals than those who didn't. The data, she said, ''were very, very conclusive.'' The chemicals that were examined were thought to be plausible culprits -- largely because they could cause cancer in mice. Still, Dr. Winn said, ''In the study, it is clear that they are not associated with breast cancer.'' The one tentative link was a very modest increase in risk from exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chemicals that are in grilled food and in cigarette smoke. But Marilie D. Gammon, the Long Island study's lead investigator and an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, discounts the connection, saying the effect was minuscule and the risk did not go up with greater exposure, as it should have if the chemicals were causing breast cancer. Smokers, for example, did not have more breast cancer than nonsmokers.
A carefully controlled study that tried to treat Parkinson's disease by implanting cells from aborted fetuses into patients' brains not only failed to show an overall benefit but also revealed a disastrous side effect, scientists report. In about 15 percent of patients, the cells apparently grew too well, churning out so much of a chemical that controls movement that the patients writhed and jerked uncontrollably. The researchers say that while some patients have similar effects from taking too high a dose of their Parkinson's drug, in this case the drugs did not cause the symptoms and there is no way to remove or deactivate the transplanted cells. On the researchers' advice, six patients who enrolled in the study but who had not yet had the implantation  operation have decided to forgo it. The results, reported today in The New England Journal of Medicine, are a severe blow to what has been considered a highly promising avenue of research for treating Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological ailments. The study indicates that the simple solution of injecting fetal cells into a patient's brain may not be enough to treat complex diseases involving nerve cells and connections that are poorly understood. Some say it is time to go back to the laboratory and to animals before doing any more operations on humans.
The Food and Drug Administration said today that it was still wrestling with questions about how to regulate hormone replacement therapy for postmenopausal women after a study raised questions about its safety. The issues for the agency arose when a large federal study of what was the most popular hormone treatment, Prempro, made by Wyeth, was halted this year, five years after it began. Investigators for the study, known as the Women's Health Initiative, found that there were small but important risks, including breast cancer, from taking the drug. But there are dozens of hormone therapies besides Prempro on the market. Should the findings of the Women's Health Initiative, which tested Prempro, be applied to these other products? Should makers of new drugs for menopause be required to show they are safe in long-term studies? At meeting here sponsored by the National Institutes of Health to discuss the future of hormone replacement therapy, Wyeth scientists and independent scientists said there was no reason to expect that the other products would not have the same risks as Prempro.
''In general, endocrine problems can be treated,'' Dr. Maratos-Flier said. ''If you have too much of something you can get rid of it, and if you have too little you can add it back.'' Among the host of newly discovered molecules is a small protein, AGRP, for agouti related protein, that seems to regulate how many calories mice consume and whose production is controlled by leptin. Dr. Gregory S. Barsh of Stanford University, an associate professor of pediatrics and genetics, and, independently, Dr. Kevin Stark, a researcher at Amgen, found the protein two years ago . Dr. Barsh explains that it attaches itself to brain cells in the eating control centers in the hypothalamus. Researchers have already tested a drug that mimics AGRP -- one injection makes animals gorge for a week. Another drug blocks AGRP, making animals stop eating. Humans also have AGRP, and Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly, a professor of metabolic medicine at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, has found that about 5 percent of massively obese people have mutations that cause them to behave as though they are overresponding to AGRP, many more than have mutations preventing them from making leptin.
Another challenge is to make robotic operations easier. Even seemingly minor issues like where to poke the holes in the chest for the robot arms can be problematic. Dr. Wolf said that when he first began doing robotic surgery, the robot's arms would be too close together and would bump into each other. Blood vessels differ from patient to patient, so, for now, positioning the holes is more a matter of practice and experience than of following a formula. But those who are testing the robotic systems find their imaginations soaring. Dr. Wolf envisions doing heart surgery on patients in another state or even another country, controlling the robot from as far away as he pleases, while other surgeons stand by. Dr. Michler said that the tiny robot fingers and the precision of its movements could make it ideal for doing heart surgery on fetuses. Dr. Harold Urschel, a professor of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas, said that the computer, which corrects automatically for tremors in a surgeon's hands, would allow older doctors to operate. ''This is going to make you just as good when you're 80 as you were when you were 25,'' he said.
''We wouldn't be able to handle it financially,'' Mr. Walsh said. Ideally, the hospital would also use an M.R.I. machine, the most accurate brain scan for strokes. But keeping the $1.5 million machine near the emergency department ''could never be justified by the business'' in diagnosing strokes, Mr. Walsh said. The hospital's only M.R.I. scanner comes in by ferry on Saturday morning and leaves Sunday night. And the hospital would also need other specialists, like a neuroradiologist, to interpret the scans and a neurosurgeon to deal with possible bleeding problems. Those impediments left Martha's Vineyard Hospital in the same situation as most hospitals in the United States: stroke diagnosis and immediate care was the sole responsibility of the emergency room doctor, who, Dr. Tsai said, worried about giving tPA. The concern is bleeding in the brain -- it occurs about 6 percent of the time with tPA and can be fatal. The worst fear is to give tPA, cause a fatal bleed and find out the patient had not even had a stroke.
When the scientists from Elan Pharmaceuticals in San Francisco gave mice the vaccine, the animals produced antibodies that blocked the accumulation of beta amyloid in their brains, and it even seemed to help clean up some that had already accumulated. It was, in a sense, proof of a principle illustrating that the immune system of mice, when properly primed, could attack the dangerous Alzheimer's proteins in the brain. That research also marked the start of an orderly process to determine objectively whether a new treatment was safe and effective. When animal studies are completed, the next major step is to ask what happens in patients. Safety studies come first, with so-called Phase 1 studies that are not meant to show effectiveness, but any worrisome or alarming adverse reactions to the treatment. Patients are given increasing doses of the drugs while scientists monitor side effects. After Phase 1 are the much larger studies, involving hundreds or thousands of patients, to ascertain if a drug is effective.
THERE'S an overweight man in the White House and his name is George W. Bush. Yes, the president of the United States, known for his robust good health, is officially overweight, according to the standards of the National Institutes of Health. At 6 feet and 194 pounds, his body mass index, or B.M.I., a measurement of height relative to weight, is 26.4, and 25 or above is officially overweight for both sexes. And so President Bush joins about 65 percent of Americans who are overweight or obese -- a status derived solely from that body mass index dividing line of 25. Of course, the authorities can be wrong when it comes to matters of weight and health. Just last week, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said its previous estimate that 400,000 Americans die each year from obesity and overweight was too high. So, does President Bush's B.M.I. of 26.4 actually make much difference to his health? ''Probably not,'' says Dr. George Bray, an obesity researcher at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center of Louisiana State University. ''Body mass is an index from which you start to make an evaluation of an individual.''
Scientists have prodded bone marrow cells to turn into nerve cells, raising the tantalizing possibility of an easily accessible source of replacement cells to treat brain and nerve injuries and diseases. But the work is just beginning, experts say, and it remains to be seen whether the newly created nerve cells can correct spinal cord injuries or brain diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, even in animals. The research is described in the current issue of the Journal of Neuroscience Research. The lead author of the article, Dr. Ira Black, who is a professor and the chairman of the neuroscience and cell biology department at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in Piscataway, N.J., said he began the research with the thought of studying how the body's cells, each of which has the same set of genes, determine whether they would become blood cells,  brain cells, liver cells and so on.
The study researchers used a computer program that revealed the colon in three dimensions. Most other virtual colonoscopy has involved two-dimensional slices created from C.T. scan images. The patients in the new study also drank a fluid that labeled fecal material so doctors did not confuse it with polyps. ''It really matters what method you're using and how you prepare the colon,'' Dr. Pickhardt said. But, he cautioned, virtual colonoscopy patients still must undergo the onerous process of cleansing their colons of fecal material before the test and they must insert a small tube into their rectums and pump air into their colons during the scan, a procedure that can be uncomfortable. And if the scan finds polyps, they may need a traditional colonoscopy to cut them out. Most health insurers also do not pay for the procedure. ''What is being charged varies from $500 to over $2,000,'' Dr. Pickhardt said. ''Patients are paying out of pocket. It's what the market allows.''
What is not known is how the 1918 virus moved from birds to humans. One clue could come from knowing what flu viruses existed before the 1918 pandemic. Perhaps the 1918 virus entered the human population before 1918 in a more benign form then mutated to become a killer. Or perhaps it suddenly showed up in humans, jumping directly from birds to people. To find out, Dr. Taubenberger and Dr. John Oxford of the Royal London Hospital are looking for human flu viruses that existed before 1918. London Hospital has a collection of human tissue obtained from 1908 to 1918. Dr. Taubenberger is searching for flu viruses in lung tissue from people who died of pneumonia in those years, hoping to use the same methods that allowed him to piece together the 1918 virus to resurrect a flu virus that was in humans before 1918. The 1918 virus also is teaching researchers about experimental vaccines that scientists hope will protect against a variety of influenza strains. The plan had been to make a sort of universal flu vaccine that would protect against various flu viruses. Then people would not need a flu shot each year, and the vaccine might stop pandemic flu strains from ever gaining a toehold.
The agency is posting the proposal on its Web site (www.fda.gov -- follow the links to ''Medical Devices,'' then ''Recent Federal Register Notices''). Today the agency will hold a satellite teleconference in which the device makers, the companies that reprocess devices, doctors, hospitals, and ethicists can comment. And on Dec. 14, the agency will hold a public meeting on its proposal. From all accounts, the business of reprocessing medical devices is booming, with commercial companies springing up to clean and sterilize devices and to take on the liability if their processes fail. Mark Salomon, the senior vice president of corporate development at Vanguard Medical Concepts, a reprocessing company in Lakeland, Fla., said that when he joined Vanguard in 1995, it had just 12 employees. Now, 220 people work there and the plant has grown to 50,000 square feet from 2,000 square feet. Used devices are cleaned and disinfected. Then the company tests them to make sure they still function the way they are supposed to. Finally, the devices are packaged and sterilized with ethylene oxide gas, the same method that the device makers use. The question is: Are the devices really as good as new?
Even the names given to some tumors hint at their ambiguous nature. There are ''incidentalomas,'' adrenal gland tumors of unknown significance that began turning up in increasing numbers when people had C.T. scans or M.R.I.'s for other conditions. Medical specialists do not know whether they should be removed or left alone, but they do know that lethal adrenal cancers are far too rare for many of those tiny tumors to be dangerous. In cervical cancer, the most common abnormality found with Pap tests is called ''atypical squamous cells of unknown significance.'' ''The name tells you how much we know about its natural history,'' Dr. Barnett Kramer, director of the Office of Disease Prevention at the National Institutes of Health, said. The condition's significance is unclear, but to be safe, doctors remove the abnormal cells. Experts may not even agree about whether a cell sample looks abnormal, as Dr. Farmer learned a few years ago. He and his colleagues asked expert pathologists to submit what they considered classic slides of skin tumors that were either malignant or not, examples that these specialists thought were so clear that they could be used in a textbook. Dr. Farmer and his team sent the slides of cells from 37 patients to eight leading pathologists. Those experts had agreed to decide whether the tumors were cancerous or normal or whether the category was unclear.
Elbert Littlefield, 76 and seriously ill with diabetes and congestive heart failure, had all but given up trying to take care of himself. With three doctors and with 24 pills in the morning and 14 at night, he was never sure if he had taken his medications correctly and could not even list what they were. He was repeatedly rushed to the emergency room and asked for his diagnoses and a list of his medications, though, he said, ''there was no way in the world I could remember.'' Now all that has changed through an innovative program that has lowered costs by, among other things, assigning nurses and creating electronic records for some patients in Bellingham and surrounding Whatcom County, in northwest Washington. With a nurse's help, Mr. Littlefield, of Lynden, Wash., has learned to follow instructions and take his medications properly. And his record is in a computer file, so when he sees a new doctor or goes to the emergency room, he no longer has to try to remember diagnoses or the names of drugs he cannot even pronounce.
At the same time, however, surgeons caution that robotic surgery will take time to develop and perfect and that there is a real danger in promising too much too soon. ''I do think that ultimately robotics are going to be a significant contribution to surgery,'' Dr. Mack said. ''But I think there is a 5-  to 10-year time line. My concern is that in the enthusiastic push, in the unbridled enthusiasm, that everyone gets caught up in the hype.'' ''The push is good -- otherwise progress will never get made,'' Dr. Mack said. But he added that he was worried that people would expect too much too soon, and then would lash out against the robotic systems when they failed to fulfill unrealistic expectations immediately. ''But I am concerned that things not get trashed,'' Dr. Mack said.
These conclusions are emerging from animal studies that probe why low-calorie diets prolong life. One early idea was that the diets reduce the lifelong wear and tear on the body, which contributes to aging, so that if you are on a restrictive diet for your whole life, or most of it, you will live longer. But scientists in London reported last week that the protective effect of low-calorie diets in fruit flies pops up within 48 hours after the diet begins. It goes away just as quickly, so that a fly that starts dieting in middle age is in the same shape as one that had been dieting all along. One that dieted until middle age and then stopped is the same as one that had never dieted at all. In every case, something seems to be happening overnight to allow the insects to resist diseases or injuries that would have killed them.
''Some runners in our lab don't look good when they run, but they are very economical,'' Dr. Morgan said. ''Others are aesthetically beautiful but are not economical.'' Exercise physiologists are focusing on ways to make runners more efficient. They speculate that a number of factors might determine efficiency, and that some, like the biochemistry of the runner's muscles or the structure of the runner's body, are simply innate. But one factor, stride length, might be amenable to change. About 20 percent of the competitive runners that Dr. Morgan and his colleagues tested were overstriding, or taking steps too large for maximum efficiency. None were taking steps that were too small. The researchers set out to train the overstriders to take shorter steps. For three weeks, five times a week, the athletes ran on treadmills at the physiology lab, their pace set by the beat of a metronome. That rhythm forced the runners to shorten their strides, and, as a consequence, they ran about 3 percent faster.
FOR no reason that I could think of, I had developed an itchy red rash on the insides of both arms. It did not look like poison ivy and I was not allergic to anything else, as far as I knew. But I tried the obvious -- I changed soaps; I changed laundry detergent; I changed fabric softener. And the rash persisted. Finally, five weeks later, I gave up and went to see a dermatologist. He took one look and gave me a diagnosis: pityriasis rosea. It is a rash of unknown origin, he said, but thought to be caused by a virus. It usually strikes a person once and never again. And, he added, it is a dermatologist's dream -- it is harmless, goes away on its own, but lasts for weeks or months so almost everyone who gets it ends up seeing a doctor and paying for an office visit.
Need for Answers Dr. Barnett Kramer of the National Institutes of Health, knows the emotional pull of patients' stories, and he knows that when it comes to arguing about lung cancer scans, he is at a disadvantage. He does not do the scans and must rely instead on cold logic and reasoning. But he does look at data, and at recent medical history. And he is very worried about the rapid spread of spiral CT screening for lung cancer. Dr. Kramer remembers the last time that doctors thought they had a way of preventing lung cancer deaths. During the 1960's and 1970's, many recommended that smokers and former smokers have regular X-rays, and some also ordered tests of their sputum to look for cancer. Finally, researchers managed to do large clinical trials that asked whether such screenings saved lives. The results were eye-opening. Although more cancers were found in the screened group, and at earlier stages, the screenings did nothing to cut the death rate from lung cancer.
Many hospitals say they cannot afford to have neurologists on call to diagnose strokes, and cannot afford to have M.R.I. scanners, the most accurate way to diagnose strokes, for the emergency room. Although tPA was shown in 1996 to save lives and prevent brain damage, and although the drug could help half of all stroke patients, only 3 percent to 4 percent receive it. Most patients, denying or failing to appreciate their symptoms, wait too long to seek help -- tPA must be given within three hours. And even when patients call 911 promptly, most hospitals, often uncertain about stroke diagnoses, do not provide the drug. ''I label this a national tragedy or a national embarrassment,'' said Dr. Mark J. Alberts, a neurology professor at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. ''I know of no disease that is as common or as serious as stroke and where you basically have one therapy and it's only used in 3 to 4 percent of patients. That's like saying you only treat 3 to 4 percent of patients with bacterial pneumonia with antibiotics.''
''Frequently we end up with someone who has back pain and gets a CT scan or an M.R.I. of the back,'' said Dr. Samuel Money, the chief of vascular surgery at the Ochsner Clinic Foundation in New Orleans. The doctor, he said, looks at the scan and says, ''Holy smoke, you have a 6.2-centimeter aneurysm.'' The task force limited its recommendations to men ages 65 to 75 who have smoked because rupture is rare in people under age 65 and is at least three times as likely in people who have smoked. The condition is about four times as common in men as in women. Anyone with a family member who had an aneurysm is at increased risk. High blood pressure is a more minor contributor to risk, and cholesterol does not seem to make much difference, researchers say. After 75, the life expectancy is considered too short and the operation too risky.
Soon, there was a worldwide heart-rate monitor industry, led by Polar Electro Inc, of Oulu, Finland, selling more than 750,000 monitors a year in the United States and citing the ''220 minus your age'' formula as a guide for training. The formula became increasingly entrenched, used to make graphs that are posted on the walls of health clubs and in cardiology treadmill rooms, prescribed in information for heart patients and inscribed in textbooks. But some experts never believed it. Dr. Fritz Hagerman, an exercise physiologist at Ohio University, said he had learned from more than three decades of studying world class rowers that the whole idea of a formula to predict an individual's maximum heart rate was ludicrous. Even sillier, he said, is the common notion that the heart rate is an indication of fitness. Some people get blood to their muscles by pushing out large amounts every time their hearts contract, he said. Others accomplish the same thing by contracting their hearts at fast rates. As a result, Dr. Hagerman said, he has seen Olympic rowers in their 20's with maximum heart rates of 220. And he has seen others on the same team and with the same ability, but who get blood to their tissues by pumping hard, with maximum rates of just 160.
''We tried a 10-minute delay,'' Dr. Grant said, taking the rats out of the wheel and making them wait in their home cages before putting them in the special room. They were conditioned. But when she made the animals wait half an hour in the home cage, the conditioning failed. Given a choice, the rats did not hang out in the room with the horizonal stripes. The question is, What is going on in the brains of these rats that seems to make running irresistible? Some clues are now emerging from the laboratory of Dr. Stefan Brene, a neurobiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. They build on a growing body of science indicating that many addictions are, at their core, the same, with a final common pathway. No matter what else drugs like morphine, cocaine, alcohol, nicotine, amphetamines, cannabis and painkillers like Darvon do in the brain, eventually they precipitate a chemical signal that arrives at the nucleus accumbens, a structure toward the front of the brain. And that chemical signal is always the same: a flood of the nerve hormone dopamine.
''Whatever is happening to evidence-based treatment?'' Dr. Arthur Yeager, a retired dentist in Edison, N.J., wrote in an e-mail message. ''When the facts contravene conventional wisdom, go with the anecdotes?'' The problem, some medical scientists said, is that many people -- researchers included -- get so wedded to their beliefs about diet and disease that they will not accept rigorous evidence that contradicts it. ''Now it's almost a political sort of thing,'' said Dr. Jules Hirsch, physician in chief emeritus at Rockefeller University. ''We're all supposed to be lean and eat certain things.'' And so the notion of a healthful diet, he said, has become more than just a question for scientific inquiry. ''It is woven into cultural notions of ourselves and our behavior,'' he said. ''This is the burden you get going into a discussion, and this is why we get so shocked by this evidence.'' The truth, said Dr. David Altshuler, an endocrinologist and geneticist at Massachusetts General Hospital, is that while the Western diet and lifestyle are clearly important risk factors for chronic disease, tweaking diet in one way or another -- a bit less fat or a few more vegetables -- may not, based on studies like the Women's Health Initiative, have major effects on health. ''We should limit strong advice to where randomized trials have proven a benefit of lifestyle modification,'' Dr. Altshuler wrote in an e-mail message.
James Smith, a health economist at the RAND Corporation, has heard a variety of hypotheses about what it takes to live a long life -- money, lack of stress, a loving family, lots of friends. But he has been a skeptic. Yes, he says, it is clear that on average some groups in every society live longer than others. The rich live longer than the poor, whites live longer than blacks in the United States. Longevity, in general, is not evenly distributed in the population. But what, he asks, is cause and what is effect? And how can they be disentangled? He is venturing, of course, into one of the prevailing mysteries of aging, the persistent differences seen in the life spans of large groups. In every country, there is an average life span for the nation as a whole and there are average life spans for different subsets, based on race, geography, education and even churchgoing.
Some speakers at the F.D.A. meeting said the benefits could not outweigh their risks. For example, Joseph Kelly, president of Dads and Daughters, a national nonprofit group that says it ''galvanizes fathers and others to transform the pervasive cultural messages that devalue girls and women,'' told the panel he was worried that the availability of implants would encourage healthy teenage girls to believe they should enlarge their breasts. ''We are hammering our children with the notion that how they look is more important than who they are and what they can do,'' he said, ''and that is just wrong.'' Mr. Kelly said that even if the devices were proved absolutely risk-free, he would not want them on the market. And because safety, as Miller noted, is defined in terms of a ratio of benefit to risk, ''if there is zero benefit, then it can never be safe.'' Dr. Diana Zuckerman, president of the National Center for Policy Research for Women and Families, asked, ''What is the risk and what is the benefit, and who decides?''
But a total body scan would have found the masses in his kidney, liver, and lung, Dr. Casarella said. Of course, Dr. Casarella said, the scanning centers point to grateful patients. ''They have poster children. Here's a patient we found who had a renal cancer. We took it out and he's cured. I'm sure that's a true story, but how many patients did they screen to find it, was it going to kill the patient, how big was it, was it invasive?'' The very idea of total body scans promoted to the general population makes him shudder. ''It's a prescription for panic,'' he said.
Strokes from atrial fibrillation can largely be prevented with anticlotting drugs like warfarin. Yet many who have the condition do not know it and many who know they have it were never given or do not take an anticlotting drug. Some strokes can also be prevented by procedures to open obstructed arteries in the neck that supply blood to the brain. As for Dr. Fite, she completely recovered. And she has changed her ways. She was sobered by the cost of her treatment and brief hospital stay -- $96,000, most of which was paid by her insurance company. But she was even more sobered by how close she came to catastrophe. Now, Dr. Fite takes three blood pressure pills, a drug to prevent blood clots and a cholesterol-lowering drug. She plans to take those drugs every day for the rest of her life. ''I was so stupid,'' she said. ''Boy, when you go through this, you never want to go through it again.''
Dr. Sodroski said that proteins like TRIM were found only in vertebrates and that the proteins were not essential for life. Humans make a protein that is nearly identical to the monkey TRIM5-alpha, he added, but it is only half as effective in blocking H.I.V. On the other hand, Dr. Sodroski said, the monkey TRIM5-alpha protein is only about 50 percent effective in blocking S.I.V., the monkey virus: its big effect is in blocking the human virus when it gets into monkey cells. The idea of an innate intracellular immunity to viruses first emerged several decades ago but scientists have only recently begun to understand it. Researchers had noticed that some strains of mice were less susceptible to a mouse leukemia virus than others, and they found that whatever was protecting the mice was inside cells. Nearly a decade ago, scientists learned that other mammals, including humans, also had an innate immunity to mouse leukemia viruses. A few years ago, they discovered why: cells that resist the mouse leukemia viruses make a protein that has an effect similar to that of TRIM5's on the AIDS virus. Its target is the capsid, and it prevents the early stages of infection.
''What they do is take a sample of 25,000 blocks sprinkled around the country,'' Dr. Freedman said. ''In an ordinary size city, it's a city block. In New York City, you might split a block. In rural Montana, you might take acres.'' Census workers go to those areas and seek out every resident. They compare their data with those obtained in the original census and ask, whom did they find who previously was missed? And whom did they miss who previously was found? From that information, the idea is to use statistics to project the error rates to every one of the seven million blocks (or their acre equivalents) in the country. BUT the census workers who go back will make their own errors in counting and in matching up their people with those found before, Dr. Freedman said. The new numbers will be different, but not necessarily better, he said. Instead of making progress, he said, the counts may be just ''going sideways.''
The obesity arena ''is so political, so rife with misinformation and disinformation,'' he said. Dr. Friedman points to careful statistical analyses of the changes in Americans' body weights from 1991 to today by Dr. Katherine Flegal of the National Center for Health Statistics. At the lower end of the weight distribution, nothing has changed, not even by a few pounds. As you move up the scale, a few additional pounds start to show up, but even at midrange, people today are just 6 or 7 pounds heavier than they were in 1991. Only with the massively obese, the very top of the distribution, is there a substantial increase in weight, about 25 to 30 pounds, Dr. Flegal reported. As a result, the curve of body weight has been pulled slightly to the right, with more people shifting up a few pounds to cross the line that experts use to divide normal from obese. In 1991, 23 percent of Americans fell into the obese category; now 31 percent do, a more than 30 percent increase. But the average weight of the population has increased by just 7 to 10 pounds since 1991.
''We were all very, very hopeful,'' Dr. Dominko said. The investigators were trying variations on the same method that worked for Dr. Wilmut when he made Dolly. They would take a monkey egg, remove its genetic material and slip in the cell of another monkey. If cloning worked, the egg would use the genetic material from the new cell to direct the development of a monkey that was genetically identical to the one that provided the cell. The researchers began by trying to repeat Dr. Wolf's work. They got embryos that were clones, but most were horribly deformed and died. The few that lived long enough to be transferred to a monkey's uterus died soon afterward. Dr. Dominko said she transferred 50 embryos. But, she said, ''we never obtained a single pregnancy.'' She decided to go back and take apart the cloning process, trying to figure out what was going wrong. To clone, scientists subject eggs and embryos to some pretty harsh treatment, including adding chemicals and dyes; poking, prodding and pulling on the eggs; and subjecting them to electric shocks. One of those treatments, she thought, might be doing the damage.
As for the gene variant that, by itself, increases risk fivefold, 17 percent of blacks in the general population have it while only 2 percent of whites do. The researchers did not determine the frequency of the gene variants in the population as a whole. In congestive heart failure, the heart is unable to pump effectively. Patients' hearts grow large in an increasingly futile effort to accommodate, but as the organ continues to fail, fluid accumulates in the patients' lungs. The patients become so short of breath that they cannot walk across a room, and half die within five years. More patients are hospitalized for congestive heart failure than for all cancers combined. While drugs can help, the condition remains difficult to treat. The only cure is a heart transplant for those still healthy enough to receive one and lucky enough to have a donor. The new research, by Dr. Stephen B. Liggett, a molecular geneticist and heart failure specialist, and Dr. Lynne E. Wagoner, a heart failure and heart transplant expert, both at Cincinnati, and their colleagues, tried to determine whether particular genes might increase a person's risk.
At the meeting on Tuesday, two F.D.A. committees, the Nonprescription Drugs Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee for Reproductive Health Drugs, heard evidence from F.D.A. staff members; Barr, the company marketing the drug; and the public. The panels consist of experts in a variety of fields, including obstetrics and gynecology, pharmacology, pediatrics and internal medicine. They also represent a spectrum of views on birth control. The company provided data from studies that showed the label to women ages 12 to 50 in shopping malls and then assessed their comprehension. It also provided a study of more than 500 women in family planning centers who took the drug, asking whether they followed instructions. The studies, the company argued, indicated that women could understand the label and take the drug as intended. Extensive studies with contraceptives also indicate that side effects, like nausea and vomiting, were limited and minor, the company said, adding that it knew of no deaths.
With obesity much on Americans' minds, an entire industry has sprung up selling diets and diet books, meal replacements and exercise programs, nutritional supplements and Internet-based coaching, all in an effort to help people lose weight. But a new study, published today, finds little evidence that commercial weight-loss programs are effective in helping people drop excess pounds. Almost no rigorous studies of the programs have been carried out, the researchers report. And federal officials say that companies are often unwilling to conduct such studies, arguing that they are in the business of treatment, not research. ''In general, the industry has always been opposed to making outcomes disclosures,'' said Richard Cleland, the assistant director for advertising practices at the Federal Trade Commission. ''They have always given various rationales,'' Mr. Cleland said, from '''It's too expensive,' to even arguing that part of this is selling the dream, and if you know what the truth is, it's harder to sell the dream.'' The study, published in today's issue of Annals of Internal Medicine, found that with the exception of Weight Watchers, no commercial program had published reliable data from randomized trials showing that people who participated weighed less a few months later than people who did not participate. And even in the Weight Watchers study, the researchers said, the results were modest, with a 5 percent weight loss after three to six months of dieting, much of it regained.
Among the skeptics was Dr. Donald Berry, the chairman of the biostatistics department at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and a member of the P.D.Q. panel. Dr. Berry led one of the seven teams of statisticians whose paper is published today and is the lead author of the new paper. ''This is the first time that a study does it right in asking the effects of screening separate from therapy,'' Dr. Berry said. ''My own view has changed a little because of the solidifying of the benefits.'' He and others emphasized, however, that mammograms had risks and that women should be counseled before deciding to be screened. The risks include false positives; 90 percent of what looks like cancer turns out not to be. They also include the problem that a proportion of cancers -- from the clinical trial data, Dr. Berry estimates at least at 30 percent -- that are detected and treated would not have caused a problem if they had been left alone. Those are the indolent cancers, ones that never grow much or spread outside the breast. But because no one knows which cancers are dangerous and which are not, doctors treat them all.
''This clearly is a better mousetrap,'' Dr. Camp said. ''It is easier to administer and easier to use.'' In 1997, Dr. Camp started the company to market the drug. ''We think it is the world's smallest drug company,'' she said. ''It has three and a half people.'' Dr. Camp said that although she loved the proposed name for the drug, Plan B, the F.D.A. was taken aback. ''It took seven months of appeal to get that trade name approved by the F.D.A.,'' Dr. Camp said. ''The guys at the nomenclature committee did not get it. They said the name is flippant.'' In the meantime, the state of Washington did not wait for Plan B to get on the market. In March 1998, advocates, led by a nonprofit group called the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health, or Path, along with the state's pharmacy association, the Washington State Board of Pharmacy, the University of Washington, and the public relations agency Elgin DDB -- the same company that helped with the promotion of mifepristone -- put into place a program that exploited a unique feature of the state's laws.
NEWS ANALYSIS
He added, however, that some of his patients might have difficulty finding an alternative to Vioxx. Pain relief, he said, is idiosyncratic and unpredictable. ''Some patients respond beautifully to one drug and not to another.'' And some patients are simply reluctant to give up a drug that worked for them. Dr. Jerry Lynn, a retired dentist who lives in Manhattan, said Vioxx was the only drug he had ever taken for his arthritic knee. ''It made a big difference,'' he said yesterday. He still has a large supply, he said, adding, ''I'll just use them until I use them up.'' MERCK AND VIOXX: THE OVERVIEW Correction:  October 2, 2004, Saturday  A front-page article yesterday about Merck's withdrawal of Vioxx, its arthritis and pain medication, from the market misstated the findings of the study that led to the action. Among patients taking Vioxx, the study found 15 cases of heart attack, stroke or blood clot per thousand people per year, not over three years. Among patients taking a placebo, the study found 7.5 such cases per thousand people per year, not over three years.
In presenting its findings, the company discarded thousands of participants who dropped out. Some say that is reasonable because it shows what can happen if people stay with a treatment. But statisticians often criticize it, saying it can make results look better than they are. ''It's a well-known bias,'' said Dr. David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California, Berkeley. With an analysis limited to those who stayed in the study, rimonabant resulted in an average weight loss of about 19 pounds, Dr. Pi-Sunyer said. In comparison, patients who received a placebo and who, like the rimonabant patients, were given a diet and consultations with a dietician, lost about 5 pounds in a year. Patients hit plateaus after about 34 weeks, when their weight loss ceased. If they stopped taking the drug, they gained back all they had lost, but the hope is that if people continue taking the drug indefinitely, they can maintain that weight loss and gain health benefits, Dr. Pi-Sunyer said.
There had been hints before that the drug might increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, but the studies were not definitive and the company said it had not been convinced that the risk was real, although it did revise the drug's label two years ago to include that possibility. This time was different. ''What we saw was stunning,'' Dr. Kim said. ''We certainly don't understand the cause of this effect, but it is statistically significant and it indicated that there is an issue.'' Dr. Kim said the decision came on Monday, after a series of urgent teleconferences with medical experts over the weekend. On Tuesday, company officials went to the Food and Drug Administration and said it was withdrawing the drug. The decision was the company's alone, and there was no pressure from the F.D.A., which said it was surprised by Merck's move but agreed with it. ''We think Merck did the right thing,'' said Dr. Steven K. Galson, the acting director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
Robert Gordon, a New York lawyer not involved in the motion but who represents women with implants, said the plaintiffs' lawyers were not accusing Dr. Tugwell of intentionally altering his findings at the behest of Bristol-Myers Squibb. Nor, he said, are they accusing the company of deliberately trying to buy Dr. Tugwell's support. But, Mr. Gordon said, when all of Dr. Tugwell's contacts with the company are considered together along with the fact that he did not disclose them, it ''undermines the trust of the litigants'' and throws the panel's findings into question. ''It's not a lot of money -- I don't think that's what the point is,'' Mr. Gordon said. The conflict of interest statement that Dr. Tugwell signed asked if he or anyone in his household ''ever received any research funds, graduate support or other funds (awards, honoraria, speaking or consulting fees, etc.) from any interested party.'' The contacts he had with Bristol-Myers occurred after Dr. Tugwell filed his conflict of interest statement. The plaintiffs' lawyers say he should have altered the form at that point.
If only it were so, obesity experts say. The fact, however, is that more than 90 percent of dieters gain back every pound they lose and no diet or behavioral modification has improved those odds. Now, leading obesity researchers say they have been forced by an overwhelming body of evidence to reach a surprising conclusion: the simple decisions of what, when and how much to eat may not be completely under people's conscious control. Each person, they say, inherits a range of weights that his or her body can comfortably maintain. A person's weight range typically varies by about 10 percent from a midpoint. A 150-pound woman, for example, might be able to weigh from 135 to 165. But every time her weight dips below 135 pounds or creeps beyond 165 pounds, her body will institute controls, like an insatiable urge to eat or a feeling of disgust at the sight of food, to bring its fat levels back in line.
Also, the troops must be trained in how to use it and surgeons must be trained about what to expect. Meanwhile, the Army and the Special Operations forces are taking an additional approach to clotting, Colonel Holcomb said. They will use coated bandages to stop bleeding. One bandage, developed by the Red Cross, used two clotting proteins, fibrin and thrombin, to speed clot formation. The other, made by HemCon of Oregon, uses chitosan, a clot-promoting protein in shrimp shells. Remaining problems include what to do about severe injuries to the abdomen or pelvis, which may cause rapid and uncontrolled internal bleeding, or bleeding in the brain from a head injury. ''What about an intravenous drug that could accelerate the hemorrhage-control process?'' Dr. Holcomb asked. The Army, he said, is considering using factor VIIa, a clotting drug recently approved for treating hemophilia. Animal studies, he said, indicate that it can work, and trauma centers often use it. The Defense Department and the company hope to conduct a clinical trial.
''I'm a little surprised,'' she said. ''But also at some level, I'm not. In studies that were done in the last several years, there were always a significant percent of doctors who say they would do medical abortions. But I was always a little suspicious. It's a lot easier to say you'll do it than to actually do it.'' In addition, Dr. Oyer said, many women do not want their doctor -- or anyone in their town -- to know they had an abortion. ''I can't tell you how many women who come on their own say, 'Oh, I can't tell my doctor,' '' Dr. Oyer said. ''And sometimes their doctor is someone who does abortions in their own office.'' Ms. Rothrock said she too had not received any calls from private doctors for backup services. Her clinic, she said, is one of only two that provide abortions in a 200-mile radius, and the other clinic has decided not only that it will not provide backups but that it will not even provide mifepristone. Its owner, Roneal Martin, said his doctors did not have time to be on call for the patients 24 hours a day. Even so, Ms. Rothrock said, she was not sure she would want to help private doctors whose mifepristone patients needed surgical abortions.
Today, it costs $150 or more to identify each of a person's S.N.P.'s, said Dr. B. Michael Silber, who directs pharmacogenetics research at Pfizer. The goal, he said, is to get the price down to pennies, which he called feasible. Even a man who describes himself as ''leading the way in caution'' is convinced that SNP analyses will become cheap enough to be useful. Dr. Paul Spence, the executive director of biotechnology for Searle, the pharmaceutical division of Monsanto, said that before he committed himself to SNP analyses, he actually sat down with pen and paper and worked out the economics. Like Dr. Spence, he concluded that cost would not be an obstacle for long. As for Dr. Roses of Glaxo Wellcome, as early as September of 1997, he persuaded his company to begin storing DNA samples from every patient in most of its drug studies. The idea is that when the SNP's are found, the company can go back and ask: What patterns of these molecular markers correlate with what sort of drug responses? If one pattern is associated with a drug's efficacy and another with bad side effects, the company would consider marketing the drug only to those with the pattern that predicts a good response.
Now the question is whether women and doctors will believe the findings. Some, like Dr. Marcie Richardson, a gynecologist at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a group practice in Boston, say the results do not confirm their own experience with patients. ''I've seen lots of women who either stopped cold turkey or who tapered and who come in and say, 'I can't think' or 'I can't sleep' or 'I can't be focused,' '' Dr. Richardson said. ''It's hard for me to understand the results in this context. I saw a woman this week who said, 'I don't care if it causes cancer.' She just feels so much better. What that's got to mean from my perspective is that the people who feel better is a subset of women. I'm not seeing randomized women who are enrolled in a study.'' One of her patients, Lucinda Doran, said the results did not apply to her. Ms. Doran said she learned, when she tried to stop taking Prempro last summer, how much she needed it -- not just for night sweats, her initial reason, but because her memory is better, her decision-making improved and her mind is clearer when she takes the drug. She knows the health risks, she says, and accepts them. ''For me it's a trade-off,'' she said. ''I'm the president of a company. My mind has to be on.''
''This was a triumph of wishful thinking over science,'' said Dr. Diana Zuckerman of the National Center for Policy and Research for Women and Families, an educational and advocacy group. Others said the panel's decision was the right thing to do. ''There are no serious health risks, and women like them and want to use them,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Connell, an emeritus professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Emory University. Dr. Connell was the chairwoman of a 1992 F.D.A. panel that recommended a moratorium on the sale of implants while data were gathered on their safety. Dr. Connell is now a senior counselor to Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse, an advocacy group, but said she had no connection to Inamed. She said she was satisfied with the data compiled since 1992. Panel members said they had agonized over their votes. Women can have saline breast implants, but many say they feel hard and unnatural and can suddenly deflate.
In the highly competitive and lucrative world of fertility treatments, some clinics discourage women whose chances of becoming pregnant are slim in order to boast about their success rates. But other clinics welcome such women, in some cases promising miracles from expensive treatments that have no scientific rationale and no evidence to back their effectiveness. According to national data, a woman under age 35 has a 35 percent chance of having a baby after a single in vitro fertilization attempt with her own newly fertilized eggs. The odds drop off steeply with age, however; for a woman aged 38 to 40 the chance is 20 percent, and for a woman aged 41 to 42 it is 10 percent. Fertility experts say that patients today arrive at their clinics fully aware of the statistics and the medical possibilities. Many have been to other clinics and, having failed to become pregnant, are seeking a new start. Most scoured the Internet, and many joined support groups where they learned about methods that leading fertility centers say are useless and even dangerous.
But many people, including doctors, wonder if they should plan for medical emergencies or for a sudden diagnosis of a serious disease and, if so, how. That is what troubled Dr. Peter K. Lindenauer, an internist and medical researcher at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Mass., and Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. At parties and at family gatherings, he said, friends, relatives and acquaintances often sidled up to him and asked for advice about where to go for medical care. He would tell them that if they had something as common as pneumonia or needed surgery for something as mundane as a hernia, they probably would do at least as well at a small local hospital as they would at a major medical center. But, he said, ''those comments were based more on gut than on actual evidence.'' He decided to look for proof. Dr. Lindenauer and his colleagues began looking at national data on two common conditions: pneumonia, the fifth-leading cause of death in America, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema and is the fourth-leading cause of death. ''When we think about bread-and-butter medical problems, these are the classic ones,'' Dr. Lindenauer said.
Dr. Furberg said he did not object to being removed from the panel, ''if it's the same rule they apply to others.'' He still has the option of presenting his data, and his opinions, in a public comment period at the meeting. ''I haven't decided yet, but several people have said, 'You should,''' Dr. Furberg said.
Simple things can fall through the cracks. ''In some ways, it's kind of scary,'' said Dr. Peter Gross, the chief of the department of internal medicine at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. ''The doctor today is much too busy and has too much to remember.'' The hospital ratings are being done by Medicare and posted on the Internet (www.cms.hhs.gov/quality/hospital/). And already, hospitals are responding, often with shock, when they discover they have been forgetting some of the very treatments that can make a difference between life and death, or sickness and health. At Duke University's hospital, for example, when patients arrived short of breath, feverish and suffering from pneumonia, their doctors monitored their blood oxygen levels and put them on ventilators, if necessary, to help them breathe. But they forgot something: patients who were elderly or had a chronic illness like emphysema or heart disease should have been given a pneumonia vaccine to protect them against future bouts with bacterial pneumonia, a major killer. None were.
But Dr. McClellan has always packed his days with almost more than seems humanly possible. ''Mark came into this world driven,'' said his mother, Carole Keeton Strayhorn, who is the comptroller for the State of Texas. He was a normal boy, an athlete and an extrovert, she said, but with a difference: he plunged into academics, and never looked up. He knew the alphabet when he was 18 months old and was reading when he was 2. When he was in first grade, he announced one night that he had 310 pages of math homework. It turned out that the teacher had told the class that when they finished their 310-page math book they would go on to the next math book. He thought he had to finish the book that night. ''Mark always has 20 plates spinning,'' Ms. Strayhorn said. She added that when her son was suggested as F.D.A. commissioner, some objected that he had had no regulatory experience. ''I said, 'Man, you don't know Mark.' ''
Patients might think such a procedure reasonable, just in case. But ''you have a lot to lose,'' said Dr. Geoffrey Rubin, the chief of cardiovascular imaging at Stanford University Medical Center. ''All these procedures are risky,'' and with no demonstrated benefit, there is no justification for the risk, he said. For example, putting a catheter in an artery in preparation to insert a stent can accidentally separate layers of the coronary artery. ''It can create disease where none existed before,'' Dr. Rubin said. ''There also is a small but very real risk of stroke when the catheter comes along the aorta, and something can flick off and go to the head,'' Dr. Rubin said. The scans also show the lungs, and often reveal little spots, almost all of which are harmless. But once the spots are seen, many patients have extensive testing, even surgery, to find out whether they are cancers.
Dr. Morens was not optimistic about the immediate future. The best hope, he said, is for improved flu vaccines and a vaccine for R.S.V. But for now, he said, doctors must do a better job of persuading older people to be vaccinated.
Scientists discovered that if they added telomerase to adult human cells growing in the laboratory, the cells would divide for extended periods of time, living much longer than their normal life span, although they would not turn into cancer cells. They also learned of a crucial difference between mice and humans: In mice, telomerase is present at high levels in adult cells as well as in fetal ones. Perhaps, Dr. Weinberg and his colleagues reasoned, if they added telomerase to normal human cells, they could then give them cancer genes and create human cancer cells in the laboratory. The experiment worked. They gave the cells two cancer genes: ras, which pushes cells to grow unrelentingly, and a gene that codes for the ''large-T oncoprotein,'' which blocks cells from responding to cellular signals to cease growing. They also added telomerase, which allows cells to double without limits. All three elements were needed. When they were present, the cells grew and looked like cancer cells and they formed tumors when they were transplanted onto mice, a standard test to see if cells are cancerous.
One clinic that asks is the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science of St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., one of the nation's largest fertility centers. Embryologists there have frozen 11,402 embryos since August 1995, from a total of 1,595 patients. Many used their embryos. One woman gave hers up for adoption, which was privately arranged. That left 6,284 in storage, from 1,006 patients. Of those patients, 191 signed or said they would sign a form directing that their embryos be discarded. But only 22 patients signed or indicated a desire to sign a form allowing their embryos to be used for research, although Dr. John Garrisi, the chief embryologist there, said that he was certain many who no longer wanted their embryos would donate them for research if he asked them personally. Patients at the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine of Eastern Virginia Medical School, another large center, are also asked to donate embryos for research. Embryologists there froze about 15,000 embryos in the last 15 years, two-thirds of which were used by the couples that owned them. About 200 embryos might be available for research according to forms signed by patients, said Dr. William Gibbons, a reproductive endocrinologist there. And that, he said, might not be enough to generate any stem cells.
Until the results are in, Dr. Abrams stressed, it is not known whether older women can forgo radiation treatments after a lumpectomy. ''We don't know the answer to the question yet and so it remains unproven,'' he said. In the meantime, researchers are moving on to other questions of particular interest to the elderly -- chemotherapy, for instance, which was tested, once again, in populations that were overwhelmingly middle-aged. ''Chemotherapy saves lives, but is it worth giving it to a woman over 70?'' asked Dr. Muss. His group, he said, is designing trials in elderly breast cancer patients to find out.
After an intensive effort to persuade Mrs. Giere's local doctor to go ahead, Mr. Giere got a prescription. In February, Mr. Giere obtained memantine from a Canadian pharmacy that gets it from Europe. He is not sure whether it is helping, but Mrs. Giere is optimistic. ''She keeps saying, 'Look, I'm coming back,' '' Mr. Giere said. It was difficult, he added, to do an end run around the F.D.A.'s rigorous scrutiny of the drug's safety and efficacy. Mr. Giere says he believes that for society, it is important to have regulatory agencies and it is destructive to ignore them. But he said he had to think of his family. ''For Linda, the alternative is just to let the disease progress,'' Mr. Giere said. As for Betty Baron, her husband is not sure what to think. At first, he said, she seemed much better with memantine and he saw glimpses of her old sparkle.
''People think technology is forging way ahead of biology, ethics, and common sense,'' Dr. Turek went on. ''All of us think about this all the time. All of the clinicians wonder what we are doing.''
For years, patients and many doctors assumed that a colonoscopy was a colonoscopy. Patients who had one seldom questioned how well it was done. The expectation was that the doctor conducting the exam would find and cut out any polyps, which are the source of most colon cancer. But a new study, published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, provides a graphic illustration of how wrong that assumption can be, gastroenterologists say. The study, of 12 highly experienced board-certified gastroenterologists in private practice, found some were 10 times better than others at finding adenomas, the polyps that can turn into cancer. One factor distinguishing the physicians who found many adenomas from those who found few was the amount of time spent examining the colon, according to the study, in which the gastroenterologists kept track of the time for each exam and how many polyps they found. They discovered that those who slowed down and took their time found more polyps.
''This is one of the long-sought-after holy grails of Alzheimer's research,'' Dr. Relkin said. In Alzheimer's disease, brain cells die, slowly and inexorably, as patients gradually lose their memories, their judgment, their ability to balance a checkbook or find their way around their neighborhoods or even their own homes. And as patients' minds crumble, areas of their brains that control memory and reasoning and judgment are covered with an accumulation of microscopic balls of debris, known as amyloid, mostly made up of aggregations of a protein fragment called A beta. ''Most of us, and most of the big pharmaceutical companies, agree that if you figure out a way of getting rid of amyloid, you will have a good drug for Alzheimer's disease,'' Dr. Tanzi said. Over the years, scientists have learned that A beta is a small piece of a much larger protein that protrudes from cells. It can be created when the beta-secretase clips the protein in two and then another enzyme, gamma-secretase, snips the resulting protein fragments, creating one piece that is the toxic A beta protein and another that is a harmless piece of protein debris.
Even the specialists who implant the devices, electrophysiologists, are in short supply. Dr. Zipes, an electrophysiologist, said that at least twice as many doctors like himself would be needed to handle the patient load. It is, said medical specialists, a portent of issues to come and it raises questions about the cost of medicine for which society has, as yet, no answers. ''This is only one example of many that we will be seeing in the coming years where there are very, very effective and very, very expensive new treatments,'' said Dr. Alan Garber, an internist and economist at Stanford University. ''Does that mean we should put the brakes on this procedure? The broader question is, Can we as a society afford to pay?'' In this case, much of the cost burden is likely to fall on Medicare, because most people with serious heart attacks are elderly. But that adds enormous costs to a publicly financed program with a fixed amount of money to spend.
Most statements on cancer risk ''are given in isolation, without context,'' said the lead author of the new paper, Dr. Steven Woloshin of the Veterans Affairs Outcomes Group in White River Junction, Vt. ''Without seeing how they compare to other risks, it is hard to gauge what they mean,'' he added. Such cancer messages can be misleading, said Dr. Suzanne Fletcher, a professor of ambulatory care at Harvard Medical School. Although cancer is primarily a disease of the elderly, the messages usually do not talk about age and often state the risk over a lifetime. What, women may ask, does this say about my chances of getting a disease? Working with Dr. Lisa M. Schwartz of the Veterans Affairs group and Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth Medical School, Dr. Woloshin decided to make the abstract risk estimates as concrete as possible. Instead of giving risk over a lifetime, the investigators gave risks over the next decade, a period that is easier to envision.
Now Mr. Woodland sits erect in a narrow wooden chair in the office of Leonard Seeff, the doctor who wrote the letter, having learned for the first time the details of his extraordinary medical situation. No one knew that the variety of hepatitis now known as hepatitis C even existed 50 years ago, yet Mr. Woodland is living proof that it did and that healthy young teenagers were being infected. He is also living proof that infection with hepatitis C need not be a death knell, or even a threat to health. Millions of copies of the virus still course through Mr. Woodland's bloodstream and burrow into his liver. Yet, in defiance of conventional medical wisdom, he has not had any overt signs of illness. For Dr. Seeff, the story of Mr. Woodland and a handful of his fellow recruits is a cautionary tale for hepatitis researchers that raises thorny questions about the study and treatment of hepatitis C.
In studies with cells grown in the laboratory, Dr. Liggett discovered that the gene that codes for production of the beta-2 adrenergic receptor protein seemed exquisitely tuned by its structure. A change in just a single chemical along the gene's length could make the protein work slightly better, or slightly worse. The next step was to find out if this could occur in humans. Dr. Liggett and his colleagues recruited 100 healthy people and began deciphering the chemical sequence of each person's beta adrenergic receptor gene. After 18 months, he got his answer. There were three different variants of the gene. All three worked fine. Nonetheless, Dr. Liggett's mind raced. Maybe this was why some people respond better than others to asthma drugs. Maybe it was why some people taking asthma drugs quickly become resistant to them and others did not. Maybe it was also tied to the way patients with congestive heart failure responded to drugs.
That, Dr. Druker and others say, is the first fruit of a new understanding of cancer as a genetic disease. But if cancer is a genetic disease, it is like no other in medicine. With cancer, a person may inherit a predisposition that helps set off the process, but it can take decades -- even a lifetime -- to accumulate the additional mutations needed to establish a tumor. That is why, scientists say, cancer usually strikes older people and requires an element of bad luck. ''You have to get mutations in the wrong place at the wrong time,'' Dr. Druker said. Other genetic diseases may involve one or two genetic changes. In cancer, scores of genes are mutated or duplicated and huge chunks of genetic material are rearranged. With cancer cells, said Dr. William Hahn, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, ''it looks like someone has thrown a bomb in the nucleus.''
''The meaning of B.M.I. has to be modulated by other factors, including age, gender, physical activity, race and central fat distribution,'' he added, referring to the amount of fat a person carries around the waist and abdomen. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute agrees, and includes high blood pressure and cigarette smoking as factors in determining whether weight is a problem. Dr. Eric Oliver, a political scientist at the University of Chicago who is writing a book about the politics behind the obesity epidemic, says that the more one looks into the health claims behind the overweight designation, the more arbitrary they seem. ''From a scientific perspective, there is no way you could make those claims based on the data,'' he said. Before 1998, a man was officially overweight with a body mass index of 27.8 and a woman at 27.3 -- numbers based on the body mass averages of people in their 20's. But a committee convened by the national heart institute redefined overweight to be a body mass index of 25 or over, for men and women.
With many foundations and universities competing for research financing, and with the heated politics of stem cell research, it is no surprise, Dr. Atkinson said, that disputes can sometimes become vitriolic. In addition, he said, the field has been whipsawed by false hopes. ''I've seen a lot of things in diabetes come and go,'' Dr. Atkinson said. ''For decades we have been told that a cure is just around the corner. That's part of the background, that's why it's emotionally heated.'' Dr. Faustman's research began when she came to Massachusetts General in 1985 to help start a program to cure diabetes with transplants of islet cells, which come from hormone-producing regions of the pancreas. She had learned to isolate human islet cells from the transplant technique's developer, Dr. Paul Lacey of Washington University, and she was confident about her skill. Other scientists had tried the transplants and failed -- the islet cells died despite immunosuppressant drugs -- but Dr. Faustman thought she would succeed.
But the most important question, Dr. Gotzsche said, is not whether women are saved from dying of breast cancer; it is whether mammograms prolong their lives. It is possible, he said, that a mammogram might find a cancer early, leading to treatment that might prevent a breast cancer death. But theoretically, the treatment might be so harsh that it precipitates another illness, so that the woman lives no longer, although her death is not attributed to breast cancer. No one study was large enough to answer that question, so the investigators combined study data. They concluded that the overall death rate did not budge when women had mammograms compared with when they did not. Dr. Greenwald said that while he had not formed an opinion about the validity of the analysis, he considered the study ''important.'' But other experts, like Dr. David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California at Berkeley, dismiss it as deeply flawed. Dr. Freedman said some of the studies Dr. Gotzsche and Mr. Olsen cite as weak were actually the strongest, and vice versa. He called Dr. Gotzsche ''incredibly alert to all difficulties in work he doesn't like'' but added, ''In papers he does like, he swallows anything.''
Dr. Lerner said that rather than indicating that early detection was of no value, the genetic signatures indicated that ''what you find is usually more important than when you find it.'' That means, he and others said, that for the immediate future, the promise in such research is to guide treatment. If a genetic signature is validated and established, it might, for example, allow doctors to tell women they can forgo chemotherapy because the surgical removal of their tumor cured them. It may allow them to find better treatments for women whose tumors have bad genetic signatures. But that is in the future, medical experts say. ''To move from these studies to treatment decisions is a big, big leap, and we're not there yet,'' Dr. Goodman said. ''It's just the beginning.'' News Analysis
The machines cost $1.5 million to $2 million each. But G.E., for one, says the expense is not much more than what it costs to build an angiography suite and argues that the scans can soon pay for themselves. Four to six patients can be seen an hour, the company notes, compared with one patient an hour getting an angiogram in a coronary catheterization laboratory. And while the scans are expected to cost less, ''the payback to the institution is typically much sooner'' with CT than with a coronary catheterization laboratory, said Sholom Ackelsberg, general manager for global CT and functional imaging research at G.E.'s health care division. It may not be just the institution that collects money, said Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. Coronary catheterization is conducted in a hospital, and insurers make one payment, a ''facilities fee,'' to the hospital and another to the cardiologist who does the test.
Those health benefits, he added, include higher levels of H.D.L. and lower levels of triglycerides, an effect that could reduce the risk of heart disease. They also include increased sensitivity to insulin, which could reduce the risk of diabetes. Blood pressure, however, was unchanged, even though weight loss normally results in lower blood pressure. Dr. Louis Aronne, a researcher for the company's study in the United States and director of the Comprehensive Weight Control Program, a diet center in New York, said the goal was not to make fat people slender. ''This is a disease-modification program,'' Dr. Aronne said. ''This is not for looking better.'' But other scientists say the health benefits remain to be seen. Dr. Rudolph Leibel, an obesity researcher at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, noted that a side effect of rimonabant was nausea. ''The patients who stick with it seem to get past that,'' he said. ''But that's probably the reason for the significant dropout. One of the things that's going to be very critical to determine, and that we won't know until we see the papers, is whether there is an aversive quality to the drug.''
Five years ago, researchers discovered a hormone that seemed to make fat mice slim. In 1995, to much fanfare, it was announced that there was a human form of it, raising hopes that the hormone might do the same thing for people that it did for the mice. But a new clinical study of the hormone in humans finds that it is not the panacea that some obesity researchers and patients had hoped for. The hormone, leptin, remains important, researchers say, because it is opening the door to an era of precise pharmacological manipulation of body weight. But the study,  sponsored by the biotechnology company Amgen, which has invested heavily in the development of a leptin-based drug, found that volunteers who injected themselves with leptin lost moderate amounts of weight at best. Most of the people taking the highest and most effective dose of the hormone dropped out of the study because they found it too unpleasant to inject themselves daily with large volumes of the substance
The study was the second blow to the estrogen hypothesis. Recently another similarly randomized study concluded that women with heart disease who were assigned the hormone had the same rate of heart attacks, including fatalities, as those women with heart disease who took placebos. For the millions of women reaching menopause, the real question is: what happens if you don't have heart disease yet? Will estrogen offer protection from the leading killer of Americans? That answer is not yet in. A federal study of 25,000 healthy women assigned estrogen at random will not be completed until around 2006. But, some say, the signs so far are not promising. Ordinarily, drugs and behavior changes, like diets and exercise, are tested first in people who already have the disease in question. Every time treatments have slowed a disease in people who are already ill, they have prevented the disease in people who are well. Is it possible for a drug, like estrogen, to fail to protect sick people and yet prevent disease in the healthy? If so, it would be a first, researchers suspect.
But even some who defend the mammography trials say the screening questions have to be raised anew with each test. ''You want to apply the question to every cancer screen,'' said Dr. Robert A. Smith, director of the division of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society. ''You want to be sure that whatever promise it appears early diagnosis holds, you haven't been completely blindsided.'' Dr. David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California at Berkeley, said he was also satisfied that the benefits of mammography were demonstrated, but agreed that every screening test had to be evaluated. ''You cannot say a priori by pure reasoning that screening helps for other diseases,'' Dr. Freedman said. Dr. Bradley Efron, a professor of statistics and health research and policy at Stanford, faults experts who have oversimplified the case. ''The people who say, 'We're saving lives,' are undoubtedly right,'' Dr. Efron said. ''They probably are saving lives. But the question is, What's the cost? We could save even more lives if all men had their prostates removed at age 50 and if all women had their breasts removed at age 50.''
But others saw them differently. Dr. Deborah Grady of the University of California at San Francisco, who wrote an editorial accompanying the paper, said in a telephone interview that many women had an almost unquestioning belief in the power of hormones to improve their lives. Some of her patients even stopped taking hormones after the data last summer showing the risks, but when they want to have sex, they take an estrogen pill -- a practice, she said, that could not make a difference even if the hormones taken regularly did increase libido. ''This is additional information showing that the estrogen mystique is not what it was cracked up to be,'' Dr. Grady said. Dr. Jennifer Hays, the lead author of the new paper, said she did not expect the results. ''We were surprised because of all the anecdotal and clinical reports that women feel better while they are on hormones,'' said Dr. Hays, a psychologist who directs the Center for Women's Health at Baylor College of Medicine. ''It is everything from 'My physical health is better' to 'I have less pain' to 'I am less depressed' to 'I am sleeping better' or 'I have more energy.' ''
''It's not about beauty or anything else,'' Ms. Darling said. ''It's about avoiding disease.'' If only it was so simple. Dr. Reubin Andres, an obesity researcher at the National Institute on Aging, sighed. ''As the sage of Baltimore, H. L. Mencken said, 'For every complex question there is a simple answer. And it's wrong.' '' In this case, the effort to help fat people help themselves has several implicit assumptions, researchers say. One is that all those overweight Americans would be healthier if they would just shed their excess pounds. ''Here is what we know,'' said Dr. Gary Foster, an obesity researcher at the University of Pennsylvania. ''If you have diabetes and you lose weight, it is likely to get better and you will go on less medication.'' That is important, he stressed, because in addition to causing immense suffering, diabetes is expensive to treat and has expensive complications -- amputations, kidney failure, blindness.
Nevertheless, some American experts, including researchers at the National Institutes of Health, say that the analysis deserves consideration, and that women should at least be aware of the debate. But others, like experts at the American Cancer Society, say the study is unconvincing. And some advocacy groups say they are agonizing over how to advise women. They say some of their members, whose cancers were found by mammography, will always be convinced that the screening test saved their lives. The debate has nothing to do with the effectiveness of breast cancer treatment. There is agreement that treatment, with surgery, hormones and chemotherapy, saves lives. Instead, the question -- which has come up before with screening tests for other kinds of cancer -- is whether earlier treatment is better. At its heart, the analysis challenges the assumption that the period when a tumor can be seen on a mammogram but not felt in a breast examination is a critical period in which cure is possible. If that assumption is wrong -- if cancers can be just as treatable, or just as deadly, whether they are found early or late -- then mammography would offer no benefits.
Manufacturers of drugs and medical devices request more leeway in distributing articles on new uses of their products. Once a drug or medical device is approved for one use, doctors can use it for any other purpose, at their discretion. But the F.D.A. says that if a company distributes articles on unapproved uses of a product, that is tantamount to promoting it. Boston Scientific, which makes medical devices, questioned those regulations. Tony Blank, the company's manager of corporate regulatory affairs, said the company could not even provide a published paper on the risks of using one of its devices in an unapproved way. ''When it becomes most concerning is when the information the company wants to provide has additional warnings to protect the patient,'' Mr. Blank said. Dr. Kessler, the former F.D.A. commissioner, says that such arguments may sound reasonable, but adds that articles may be technically accurate but not true.
''Almost everything about the clinical presentation of pertussis, especially early pertussis, is not very specific,'' Dr. Kirkland said. That was the first problem in deciding whether there was an epidemic at Dartmouth. The second was with P.C.R., the quick test to diagnose the disease, Dr. Kretsinger said. With pertussis, she said, ''there are probably 100 different P.C.R. protocols and methods being used throughout the country,'' and it is unclear how often any of them are accurate. ''We have had a number of outbreaks where we believe that despite the presence of P.C.R.-positive results, the disease was not pertussis,'' Dr. Kretsinger added. At Dartmouth, when the first suspect pertussis cases emerged and the P.C.R. test showed pertussis, doctors believed it. The results seem completely consistent with the patients' symptoms. ''That's how the whole thing got started,'' Dr. Kirkland said. Then the doctors decided to test people who did not have severe coughing.
Dr. Golub put it bluntly: ''The metastatic potential is hard-wired at the time of diagnosis.'' He said a tumor's fate could be sealed from the time it is detected, no matter how small it is. Dr. Golub said: ''These genetic studies are suggesting that your probability of metastasis may be hard-wired, but that is different from saying metastasis has already occurred. There still may be some importance to early detection.'' Dr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he believed ''the evidence really favors early diagnosis.'' But, he said, ''even in the best cases -- small tumors, no positive nodes -- tumors can metastasize.'' So, he said, if genetic signatures can identify tumors that are dangerous, though small, ''that could be a major advance.'' Dr. Bernards said his study did not address what would have happened if the women had not all been treated, nor what were the best treatments. His study asked whether a tumor's genetic signature could predict how a woman would fare in a real-world situation where different doctors prescribed treatment.
The study used glucosamine hydrochloride because it was the only type that could be manufactured at the time in a sufficiently pure form. In Europe, where glucosamine and chondroitin are sold as drugs, glucosamine comes in the form of glucosamine sulfate, Dr. Hochberg said, and some industry-supported studies have indicated that this form helps. But others said there was no reason to expect that glucosamine sulfate would be any different from glucosamine hydrochloride. They said they viewed the study's finding that the supplements had no benefit as persuasive. ''It's a null trial,'' said Dr. David Felson, a rheumatologist at Boston University. ''It doesn't work any better than placebo.'' Because the supplements are so popular, the results of the trial had been eagerly awaited. ''We've been talking about the importance of this study for the last two or three years,'' said Dr. John Klippel, president and chief executive of the Arthritis Foundation.
Now, Dr. Sacco said, there is a device, an M.R.I. scanner, that greatly improves diagnosis, there is a treatment that works and there are others being tested. ''Medical systems have to catch up to the research,'' he said. In medicine, Dr. Sacco said, ''stroke is a new frontier.'' Promise Unfulfilled One Tuesday morning in March, Dr. Steven Warach, chief of the stroke program at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, met with a team from Washington Hospital Center, the largest private hospital in Washington, to review M.R.I. scans of recently admitted patients. They were joined in a teleconference by neurologists at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., the only other stroke center in the Washington and suburban Maryland area. The images were mementos of suffering. There was a 66-year-old woman with a stroke so big the scan actually showed degenerating fibers that carry nerve signals across the brain. There was a 75-year-old who had trouble moving her right arm and right side in the recovery room after heart surgery. At first doctors thought she was just slow to wake up from the anesthesia. Now, though, it was clear she had suffered a stroke. She had lost the right half of her vision in both eyes and her right side was weak.
Two panels for the Food and Drug Administration will consider early next week whether to allow the so-called morning-after pill, now a prescription drug taken after intercourse to prevent pregnancy, to be sold over the counter. But unlike other more ordinary hearings for drugs like allergy medications to be shifted from prescriptions, this hearing has become entangled in the thorny politics of abortion, raising questions of when a pregnancy begins and who decides. If approved, the drug would be the first emergency contraceptive sold over the counter. Known as Plan B -- when Plan A, for contraception, fails or is skipped -- the drug would not only be sold in drugstores, but could also be as available as aspirin, on supermarket shelves or in convenience stores or gasoline stations. The drug, essentially two high-dose birth control pills, can prevent up to 89 percent of unwanted pregnancies if taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. But the sooner it is taken, the more effective it is.
''The hope and the expectation is that we will be able to identify subsets of patients who require less aggressive therapy, or perhaps no therapy at all,'' said Dr. Todd Golub, who directs cancer genomics research at the Whitehead/M.I.T. Center for Genome Research in Cambridge, Mass. The study, published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, had its origins a few years ago when the researchers, led by Dr. Rene Bernards, a professor of molecular carcinogenesis at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, began searching thousands of genes from breast tumors. They were asking whether there was a pattern of gene activity that was associated with a good prognosis and another associated with a bad prognosis. The methodology for such searches was developed only recently, with gene chips. When material from tumors is washed over the chips, fragments of active genes stick to the chips. Using fluorescent dyes to show when they get a hit, researchers can see patterns and correlate them with a tumor's behavior.
The nation's capital was struck by a plague so terrible that 10 percent of the population died in a matter of months. People panicked. Everyone who could fled the city. Politicians seized the moment to try to gain advantages over their opponents. An instant book appeared and became an international best seller, snapped up by some who wanted to read the gruesome details of the disease and its accompanying social disruption, and by others who wanted to pore over its list of the dead. The city was Philadelphia in 1793, and the disease was yellow fever. No one knew where the illness came from or how it was spreading. No one knew the best treatment or how to clean up the city. It was a hemorrhagic fever, Ebola-like in many  symptoms. And it was, in a way, a natural form of bioterrorism. Now, researchers at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia have found a cache of letters and documents from that terrible time, written by historic figures like Alexander Hamilton and Dr. Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and a professor at what is now the University of Pennsylvania.
A large new federal study shows that doctors can save certain patients' lives in the intensive care unit if they set their respirators so that less air is delivered than many doctors had thought necessary. The study involved patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, a condition in which the lungs are partly filled with fluid, making it impossible for patients to breathe without respirators. The condition can occur with pneumonia but it also occurs in trauma patients, including people who were in automobile accidents or who had major surgery. An estimated 100,000 Americans of all ages develop the disorder each year, medical experts said. If they recover, most have no lingering symptoms. But nearly half die. To determine how best to keep these patients alive with respirators while their lungs recover, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute sponsored a study that enrolled 861 patients across the country. They were randomly assigned to one of two treatment strategies.
''I don't think anyone involved can say they have a specific alternative explanation,'' Dr. Camardo said, ''but I think other factors should be explored.'' For example, he said, mammogram use or changes in diet or other drug use might be contributing. But any alternative explanation must also take into account the fact that the drop in breast cancer rates was almost entirely estrogen-fed tumors, Dr. Ravdin said. Dr. Berry said the researchers were well aware of the limitations of their analysis and never said they proved that declining hormone use led to 10 percent less breast cancer. ''Of course, we're not sure. We never are,'' Dr. Berry said. ''But it fits. It's a smoking gun.''
The heart operation taking place in the pale-green tiled operating room at the Ohio State University Medical Center was almost eerie. The patient, a 62-year-old man, was anesthetized, swathed with blue drapes and lying face up on a narrow table. But no one was touching him. Instead, the operation was being performed by a robot, whose three metal arms protruded through pencil-sized holes in the man's chest. At the ends of the robot's arms were tiny metal fingers, with rotating wrists, that held a minuscule instrument, a light and a camera. The robot's arms and fingers were controlled by Dr. Randall K. Wolf, sitting at a computer console in a corner of the operating room about 20 feet away. This sort of operation, heart surgeons say, is the start of what may be the biggest change in their profession since heart bypass surgery began nearly 30 years ago. ''The reason we make incisions is that we have big hands,'' said Dr. Wolf, the director of minimally invasive cardiac surgery at Ohio State. The robot's dainty fingers, no longer than a nail on a pinkie, at the end of the long sticks could eliminate that constraint.
Others are optimistic. Suzanne Condon, the director of the bureau of environmental health assessment at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, said that in an unpublished study her department found that in the Woburn case, women who drank water from certain wells when they were pregnant were more likely to have children who developed leukemia. ''We believe this sheds a lot of light on what happened in Woburn,'' she said. W. R. Grace, which was accused along with Beatrice Foods of dumping chemicals in a way that allowed them to reach the water supply, paid $8 million into a settlement fund. Both companies agreed to finance an expensive cleanup plan. The Massachusetts' health department, however, warned on its Web page, ''Findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of conducting statistical analyses on small populations.'' THAT may not be what people want to hear, statisticians concede. ''People -- and I, too -- find it hard to accept that it is just random chance that brought this horrible consequence,'' said Dr. David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California at Berkeley.
''The comment period is closed, but it's just wallowing in the agency,'' Dr. Young said. ''It's a barrier to everything, including the smallpox vaccine. Without that rule being promulgated, it makes it very difficult to go forward with confidence that the agency will approve your drug.'' Dr. Andrea Myerhoff, director of bioterrorism programs at the drug agency, said the rule was ''in the process of finalization'' and should be final in a few months. Of course, the animal tests and the new regulation will not help in the awful event that more people develop inhalation anthrax in the coming months, medical experts say. But what about trying drugs already on the market? Dr. Gerald Weissman of New York University School of Medicine notes that some drugs, including the high blood pressure drug captopril and the experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug anakinra, can block the anthrax toxin in the laboratory. Faced with an often lethal disease like inhalation anthrax, why not give the drugs to patients, he and others ask? The problem is that if drugs are given in an emergency, it can be impossible to know whether they helped or hurt.
IN a remarkable display of international cooperation and technical expertise, scientists have already isolated the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS. They know its genetic sequence. So now, in this amazing age of molecular genetics and medicine, at a time when a new viral disease is entering the human population, can scientists stop it? Can they erase its traces from the human race and set up a vaccine barricade it cannot breach? The answer, virologists say, is probably not, though prospects for effective drugs and vaccines are good. The very question, said Dr. John R. La Montagne, the deputy director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, reminded him of a time, two decades ago, when medical experts were flush with their success in eradicating smallpox. The Pan American Health Organization held a meeting in a Washington auditorium to ask what disease could be eradicated next.
''They said, 'You're anaerobic, you need more oxygen,' '' Dr. Brooks said. ''The scientists were stuck in 1920.''
Even if all the other problems with stem cells are solved, researchers will face another problem. The body's immune system will see the new cells as foreign tissue and reject them. The only sure way to prevent this is to take powerful immune suppression drugs for a lifetime, trading insulin injections, for example, for immune suppression. The problem would be avoided if the stem cells were derived from an embryo that was a clone of the patient -- the stem cells of such an embryo would be genetically identical to the patient's cells. But cloning has its own problems. Not only do many politicians and religious leaders find it ethically abhorrent to create a clone and then destroy it as an embryo to extract its stem cells, but no one has yet come near getting the process to work. One company, Advanced Cell Technology, recently announced its first attempts to create human embryos by cloning. The company failed -- its embryos never grew or developed anywhere near a point where they would contain stem cells.
But there were two problems with using birth control pills for emergency contraception. One is that half the women who take them feel nauseated and nearly one in five vomits, raising questions of whether women should take anti-nausea medication first and whether they should take more pills if they vomit. The other problem was simply the way the pills were provided. Doctors waited for women to ask for them. And even when women did ask, the pills hardly looked like routine medicine. ''A lot of us felt that so long as physicians and nurses were cutting up packages of birth control pills and sticking them in an envelope with mimeographed instructions, this would never gain acceptance,'' said Dr. Sharon Camp, director of the Women's Capital Corporation, which markets and distributes Plan B. ''It looked like something from an insurgent feminist health clinic.'' In July 1995, a small company, Gynetics, was formed to market a pill that would essentially be a high dose of ordinary birth control pills. The pill, called Preven, is still on the market, largely unstocked by drugstores and unknown by American women, Dr. Trussell said. Public health advocates thought they could do better.
''I have no idea how someone expects that you will inject neuroblasts and they will run all over the brain and replace your sick and dying neurons in Alzheimer's disease,'' said Dr. Davor Solter, a mouse stem cell researcher who directs the Max Planck Institute in Germany. Dr. Martin, who is a co-discoverer of mouse embryonic stem cells and the one who named them, added, ''There are a gazillion issues.'' That is not to say that the issues will never be resolved. Dr. Steen Willadsen, a Danish scientist and a cloning pioneer who saw the impossible happen in his field, said demand for stem cell therapies was so great that scientists would make it happen, sooner or later. But Dr. Martin and others say they worry about the short term, concerned by how the public will react when it becomes clear that stem cells are not an immediate answer for suffering patients. She and others say they are bracing themselves for a backlash when treatments fail to materialize.
But if the new study is correct, cardiologists and patients will be faced with difficult questions. Pravastatin patients in the study whose L.D.L. levels fell below 100 still had plaque growth while atorvastatin patients with those L.D.L. levels did not. Asked whether doctors should switch patients from pravastatin to atorvastatin on the basis of the findings, Dr. Nissen replied: ''I am going to choose to not answer that question. I will let my colleagues look at our findings and make their own minds up. I have already interpreted the findings and changed some of my practices.'' If atorvastatin is good, might more powerful drugs be even better? A new drug, rosuvastatin, or Crestor, made by Astra Zeneca, can lower L.D.L. levels more than atorvastatin. When statins are combined with another type of drug, ezetimibe, or Zetia, made by Merck, the combination lowers L.D.L. even more. Why not go for the greatest lowering, if a person is at high risk?
Studies by Dr. Gortmaker and others observing the television habits of children  found that fatter children watch more television. But such studies cannot distinguish between cause and effect. Were fat children watching more television because they were socially isolated or was watching television making them fat? ''There were a number of epidemiological studies showing positive, but often weak correlations between hours of TV viewing and body weight,'' Dr. Robinson said, but he added, ''I was surprised that no one had ever tried to decrease TV viewing in kids.'' He decided to conduct such an experiment, comparing 192 third-  and fourth-grade children in two schools. One was the control school, with no intervention. The other school was the focus of a concerted effort to encourage the children to watch less television. Seven months later, the children in the intervention school had gained an average of two pounds less than those in the control school and the average circumference of their waists was nearly an inch smaller.
There is, however, one statistic that scientists say is fairly solid: life expectancy at birth. And in comparing the figures for the United States and Britain, it turns out they are almost identical: 77.6 years in Britain; 77.1 in the United States. ''What do you mean by saying we're not healthy?'' asks Dr. Nortin M. Hadler, professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina. ''How do you define health?'' The question of which country is healthier, Dr. Hadler and others say, turns out to be a perfect illustration of an issue that has plagued American medicine: the more health problems you look for, the more you find. And Americans, medical researchers say, are avid about looking. The British, doctors say, are different. ''The U.K. has a tradition of independent and perhaps more skeptical primary-care practitioners who are probably slower to label and diagnose people and more reluctant to follow guidelines than their U.S. counterparts,'' says Dr. Iona Heath, a general practitioner in London. ''I have heard it argued that the U.S. believes more in the perfectibility of humanity and the role of science than the Europeans.''
Estrogen is still recommended to alleviate moderate to severe hot flashes and night sweats. ''These symptoms can be very disruptive and are often only controlled by estrogen,'' Dr. McClellan said. Many medical authorities applauded the drug agency's decision. Dr. Isaac Schiff, a gynecologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that a task force he led for the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology had advised doctors not to assume that other estrogen formulations were any safer than Prempro. But, Dr. Schiff said, ''some distinguished people in my discipline, I am embarrassed to say, put out a letter saying the patch is safer.'' Now, he said, it should be harder to make that argument. ''Some doctors who were so positive about estrogen are put on notice,'' Dr. Schiff said. ''They can't say other products are safer.'' Dr. Wulf Utian, the executive director of the North American Menopause Society, said his group also advised doctors not to assume that other estrogens are safe, but that many continued to believe that the safety problems were only with Prempro.
They also infuriate doctors, who, Dr. Beckman says, ''think these things are capricious and stupid.'' It is harder to argue with the methods being used by medical groups, like the Tufts Health Plan and the Rochester Independent Practice Association, that are employing scientific methods to survey satisfaction. Such practices, Dr. Beckman says, are becoming increasingly common in health maintenance and preferred provider groups that are starting to pay doctors according to their performance. Purchasers of insurance plans are demanding it, he added. And, he says, there is a common thread to difficult doctors: most have problems talking to, or listening to, patients. ''What often happens,'' Dr. Beckman said, ''is that the patient has something they want to tell the doctor but they're not allowed because of the doctor's style to say what they want to say.'' So the doctor does most of the talking, often alienating patients. Dr. Beckman teaches doctors simple ways to let patients tell their stories and to show empathy by responding to a patient's emotionally charged comments. For example, he said, ''A patient comes in and says to the doctor, 'I stopped smoking.' '' Instead of saying, ''That's terrific,'' the doctor will say something like, ''How's your weight?''
Dr. Carragee said that he had never believed it himself, but that the concern was widespread among patients and doctors. ''The worry was not knowing,'' he added. ''If someone had a big herniated disk, can you just say, 'Well, if it's not bothering you that much, you can wait?' It's kind of like walking on eggshells. What if something terrible did happen?'' With the new results, it is clear that the risk of waiting ''is, if not extraordinarily small, at least off the radar screen,'' Dr. Carragee said. The study involved 13 spine clinics in 11 states. All the participants had pain from herniated disks and leg pain. The patients were asked whether they would allow the researchers to decide their treatment at random. Those who did not have surgery generally received physical therapy, counseling and anti-inflammatory drugs. In the end, the study could not provide definitive results on the best course of treatment because so many patients chose not to have the treatment that they had been randomly assigned.
They come in clusters -- accumulations of plaque in arteries lead to heart attacks but also can lead to strokes and predispose to Alzheimer's disease. Diabetes can lead to heart disease, stroke and even cancer. Smoking can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as well as cancer and heart disease, which in turn predisposes to Alzheimer's. And the outlook for them is improving. People are getting the diseases later in life, and death rates are falling. Yet, in many instances, patients are undertreated or treated inappropriately. In some cases, science has not offered answers, but in others, the medical system has been unable to turn proven remedies into everyday care. Today, The New York Times examines strokes, one of the six leading killers in America. More than 700,000 Americans have strokes each year, and 150,000 die. Half the survivors end up with permanent disabilities -- loss of vision, paralysis, difficulty speaking. But many strokes that could be successfully treated are not. And most strokes could have been avoided with appropriate medical care.
In May 1999, Jim H., a young gay man living in the Boston area, arrived at an emergency room, terribly sick and frightened. He was burning with fever and spitting up blood. His throat was so swollen he could barely swallow. But the last thing he expected was the emergency room doctor's response. The doctor asked him about his sexual orientation and then asked, Had he ever had unsafe sex? ''I told him once, I had had it once,'' Jim said. It looked, the doctor said, as if Jim was suffering from symptoms that almost always appear immediately after people become infected with the AIDS virus. While most patients and even many doctors are unaware of this initial disease, AIDS experts say it is a well-known effect, caused when the virus starts replicating wildly just after it enters the body. Most patients get symptoms resembling influenza or mononucleosis, often accompanied by a rash. During the week or so that this illness persists, many are so sick they must stay in bed and many go to doctors or emergency rooms, where they usually are told that they have minor illnesses that will get better.
But such modest goals are not always  easy for fat people to accept, Dr. Foster said. Achieving them requires great effort -- and constant vigilance for life -- but it also means coming to terms with the fact that, for many, being slender will always be a fantasy. In a recent study, Dr. Foster and his colleagues asked 60 obese women to reveal what they hoped for, and what they dreamed of, when they began a diet and exercise program. The women, whose average weight was 218 pounds, said their goal was to lose, on average, about a third of their body weight, or 71 pounds for a new weight of 146 pounds. They said that their dream would be to get down to 135 pounds. But after 48 weeks of diet and exercise, their average weight loss was just 37 pounds, a loss that they had described before the study as ''disappointing and could not be viewed as successful in any way.'' And that was before they tried to maintain what they had lost.
The Women's Health Initiative study of Prempro, a combination of estrogen and progestin, involved 16,000 women and cost more than $600 million. But it addressed a question that was of vital importance to the 40 percent of American women who took hormone therapy after menopause. How safe is it to take a combination of estrogen and progestin? Estrogen unquestionably relieves symptoms of menopause, but the study asked whether it had other effects on health. The study found that Prempro conferred slight risks of heart attacks, stroke, blood clots and breast cancer that were not balanced by its benefits, slight decreases in hip fractures and colon cancer. Many of the researchers and doctors at the meeting here took issue with the study, criticizing its design and saying that the investigators did a disservice to millions of women. Many said that there are quality of life issues since without hormone therapy many women will suffer from hot flashes, vaginal dryness and night sweats.
IT is a question that occurs to almost everyone who becomes seriously ill: Should you go to your local hospital or would you do better if you went to a major medical center? It may mean a long trip when you are ill and it will almost certainly mean seeing doctors who are strangers to you. But what if going to a major medical center makes the difference between life and death? Patients reach different conclusions, based often on gut feelings about a doctor or a hospital. And medical researchers, looking for data, say they are not always certain themselves about how to decide. ''There really is very, very little information,'' says Dr. Elliott S. Fisher, a professor at Dartmouth Medical School in Hanover, N.H., who studies medical outcomes. ''It's the great weakness of all the efforts to foster consumer engagement in health care decision making.'' But there are a few hints, he and others say, and the answers from the studies so far have sometimes been a surprise.
PPL's goal is to make cloned pigs with genetic modifications that make their organs suitable for transplantation into humans. Since pig organs are the right size for humans, and since pigs are inexpensive and easy to breed, scientists have long considered them as potential donors. The problem is that the immune systems of humans or other primates react violently to pig organs, destroying them almost instantly. Dr. John S. Logan, the vice president for research and development at Nextran, a biotechnology company in Princeton, N.J.,  that hoped to develop pigs with organs suitable for transplant, explained: ''When you transplant a pig organ into a nonhuman primate, it is rejected immediately. It just turns black before your eyes, within 30 minutes.'' The reason, Dr. Logan said, is that pig cells are studded with a sugar molecule, galactose alpha 1-3 galactose, that the human immune system immediately attacks. At Nextran, scientists have avoided the problem by injecting pig embryos with genes that block the immediate rejection process. Cloning provides another potential solution, scientists could eliminate the sugar molecule before using the pig cells to create clones.
The notion that girls were entering puberty earlier got its start with the 1997 paper, published in the journal Pediatrics, on a study that involved more than 17,000 girls. The children, ages 3 to 12, were examined in their pediatricians' private offices. The author, Dr. Marcia E. Herman-Giddens, a child health expert and adjunct professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, concluded that black girls began developing breasts at an average age of 8.87 years and pubic hair at an average age of 8.78. For white girls, the average ages were 9.96 years for breasts and 10.51 for pubic hair. And, because the average ages for both those characteristics were lower than what textbooks suggested, the low end of the normal age range for puberty's onset was also pushed back statistically, to age 6 for black girls and age 7 for whites. But the average age at first menstruation -- 12.16 for black girls and 12.88 for whites -- was  about the same as the textbooks said.
Over and over again, studies show that health is linked to wealth. It even matters where a person lives. For example, in a new analysis of Medicare beneficiaries, Stephanie Raymond and Kristen Bronner of Dartmouth College find that the lowest death rates are in the wealthiest places. So in San Francisco, with a per capita income of $57,496, just 4.16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries die each year. But in Tuscaloosa, Ala, whose per capita income is $24,257, the annual death rate was 5.97 percent. Race was not a large factor. ''If you control for where people live, the disparities between black and white mortality rates become much smaller,'' said Jonathan Skinner, a Dartmouth health economist. An obvious explanation is that wealth buys health. And it seems plausible. Poorer people, at least in the United States, are less likely to have health insurance or access to medications. But Dr. Fuchs says, then why don't differences between rich and poor shrink in countries where everyone has health care?
That holds a grain of truth, because muscle is more dense than fat. But, Dr. Bouchard said, the problem is that few people put on enough muscle in proportion to their total body mass to make a noticeable difference in their weight. The idea that you will weigh the same or more but you really are thinner may be true if you work hard at weight lifting for many months, but otherwise it is another myth. But when it comes to weight lifting, researchers also confess that they have not answered some age-old questions. Why, for example, do muscles feel sore a day or two after they are stressed? One possibility is that they get damaged, with tiny tears ensuing from the work of lifting weights. But, said Prof. Stanley Salmons, a muscle researcher at the University of Liverpool, ''damage and pain have different time courses, and they respond differently to repeated bouts of exercise.'' He added that delayed muscle soreness remained a mystery. ''At this moment I do not know why muscles get sore, and no one else does either.''
Others worry about the effects on patients when their doctors suddenly announce that they will not accept the patients' insurance. ''It is a burden,'' said Dr. Bernard Katz, a family practitioner who sees H.M.O. patients and is co-chief executive of SMBP Health Services, a company in Santa Monica, Calif., that manages doctors like himself. Dr. Michael Lockshin, a rheumatologist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, said that in his hospital it is becoming almost impossible to find surgeons who will accept  H.M.O. insurance. ''They basically thumb their noses at the H.M.O.'s,'' Dr. Lockshin said, adding that he often cannot refer patients to the best surgeons. ''I have to deal with patients on a daily basis and it sometimes makes me want to tear my hair out.'' The same thing is happening in west Los Angeles as more and more specialists refuse payments from H.M.O.'s and most insurance companies, said Dr. Richard L. Taw Jr., a cardiologist in Santa Monica. Dr. Taw himself has stopped accepting most insurance payments, but his patients stuck with him. ''Nobody left me, not one patient,'' he said. ''The economy is so good now that people want to go to doctors that don't treat them like a number.''
Mr. Hosmer says his company has  not decided whether to reveal all the sites where he is finding steganography. He has found it on the auction site eBay, where people can post pictures anonymously, inserting hidden messages if they choose to, and just as anonymously download them, retrieving the messages. WetStone works under a contract to the Air Force. At George Mason University, Dr. Neil F. Johnson, a steganography expert, said he became so worried by steganography's potential to be used by terrorists and criminals that he stopped publishing his research on how to detect it, reasoning that if people knew how he detected it, and where, they could devise methods to thwart him and move their messages to sites he has not checked. ''I have no reason to think that Al Qaeda is not using steganography,'' Dr. Johnson said, but he, like others,  pointed to no proof. His research, he said, is financed by ''law enforcement.''
''At the end of the day we agreed to disagree on the issue of outcomes disclosure. I was convinced that it could be done, but it was not something the industry was going to voluntarily do.'' The F.T.C., he said, could not force companies to do the studies. Lynn McAfee, the director of medical advocacy for the Council on Size and Weight Discrimination, was aghast at the conclusion. ''I don't understand how you can have a product you never evaluate for effectiveness,'' Ms. McAfee said. ''It was a slap in the face to all people of size.'' Still, patients and their doctors need information, Dr. Wadden said. So he and his colleague, Dr. Adam Gilman Tsai, collected what information they could on the prices, the methods, and the success of nine commercial weight loss programs, like Jenny Craig, eDiets and Optifast and self-help programs, like Overeaters Anonymous. The investigators looked at the data presented on company Web sites, called the companies and searched medical journals for published papers. In their review, they included studies published from 1966 to 2003, finding 108 that assessed commercial programs. Of those, only 10 met their criteria. For example, the studies had to have lasted at least 12 weeks and to have assessed weight-loss outcomes after a year.
The companies are also conducting studies on their own, without the cancer institute. At Merck, scientists decided to go back to basics, asking whether aspirin's effects on cancer really derive from its blocking of cox-2. Perhaps, said Dr. Briggs Morrison, an executive director of clinical research at Merck, they really derive from the blocking of cox-1. If so, he said, Merck's drug, and Pharmacia's, may be useless in this context. ''I don't think it's at all clear what the mechanism is,'' Dr. Morrison said. ''We have puzzled over this for years.'' Merck and, independently, Pharmacia in collaboration with the cancer institute, are trying to replicate the recent studies showing aspirin prevents colon polyps, but instead of using aspirin they are using their prescription drugs, inhibiting only cox-2. In the meantime, Pharmacia is expanding its line of inquiry, asking whether its drug might increase the effects of standard cancer treatment. For example, in a study led by Dr. Altroki, the company is randomly assigning lung cancer patients to take Celebrex or a placebo along with their chemotherapy. The study, still small, is nonetheless encouraging, Dr. Altroki said, adding that he has long wanted to ask such questions.
Using an experimental drug injected once a month, medical researchers have blunted peanut allergies, protecting people from reacting so violently that their lives could be threatened if they accidentally ate as little as a fraction of a peanut. An estimated 1.5 million Americans are allergic to peanuts, and 50 to 100 die each year from severe allergic reactions. The drug, TNX-901, changed sensitivity so that instead of reacting to half a peanut, patients had no reactions until they ate nine on average. One-fourth of the subjects who had the highest dose could eat up to 24. Although not a cure, the drug could make a huge difference to patients, said Anne Mu√±oz-Furlong, chief executive of the Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, an advocacy group. ''Patients are told to go home and do everything they can to avoid eating peanuts,'' Ms. Mu√±oz-Furlong said. ''It's not as easy as it sounds.'' Peanuts, she added, have appeared in gravy, chili, hot chocolate and pie crusts. One person died after eating an egg roll that used peanut butter to hold the roll together.
The American Cancer Society recommends that women regularly examine their breasts for lumps, starting at age 20. The United States Preventive Services Task Force, in a recent review, concluded that there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the practice.
Now researchers are asking which type of study is correct -- or, perhaps, whether both could be correct, or both wrong. Dr. Francine Grodstein, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, says it is quite possible that both are correct. The different results may hinge on the differences between the women who joined the studies. The nurses who took hormones did so deliberately, and most continued with them for years. That is not typical behavior: most women who received prescriptions for hormones took them briefly or not at all, studies have found. Women who stay with a prescription regimen may be unusual, Dr. Grodstein said. Perhaps they generally care more about their health, and that is the reason they have fewer heart problems. Or perhaps there was some other physical characteristic, as yet unidentified, that made estrogen protect them from heart disease. Or maybe it was the participants in the Women's Health Initiative who were atypical, Dr. Grodstein said. Most women would not volunteer to be randomly assigned to take hormones or a placebo for years on end. Is there something about the type of women who join such a study that indicates an increased risk of heart disease if they take hormones?
The debate over the effectiveness of mammograms has been bitter, drawing in cancer researchers and advocates and involving questions about spending and whether opportunities to save lives were being squandered. Some experts said that mammograms were unlikely to be very effective and that it was a waste of money and resources to have every woman 40 and older have one a year. Other experts said that mammograms were crucial and that without screening to find cancer early, the treatments would not be nearly so effective. ''The emphasis was always on mammograms, mammograms, mammograms,'' while treatment was given short shrift, said Fran Visco, director of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group. In fact, Ms. Visco said, until recently the federal government paid for poor women not on Medicaid to be screened but did not pay to treat them if cancer was found. Other experts like the American Cancer Society insisted that annual mammograms were essential. Dr. Carolyn D. Runowicz , a gynecologic oncologist at the University of Connecticut and the incoming president of the society, said the death rate would not have fallen without the increase in mammograms. The decline in deaths ''is due to better screening, better use of screening,'' Dr. Runowicz said.
Some, like Dr. Nancy S. Green, the medical director of the March of Dimes, say that each of the 29 conditions ''has a reasonable intervention.'' The treatments make medical sense, Dr. Green said, and experts in the diseases advise using them. ''Keep in mind that there was considerable expert input,'' she said. The disorders are extremely rare, she and others said, making it unrealistic to demand the most rigorous scientific studies of the tests and their treatments. With just a few dozen babies born with a condition each year, it could take decades to get such data. Medical experts have little choice but to use their informed judgment about the tests and the therapies. But Dr. Ellen Wright Clayton, a professor of law and pediatrics at Vanderbilt University, said that in assessing treatments, the committee had relied mostly on ''the lowest form of evidence'': the personal opinions of medical specialists and advocacy groups.
The meeting was announced discreetly on Tuesday on the Web site of the Food and Drug Administration (www.fda.gov/cder/drug/safety/WHI_statement.htm), tucked into the end of a statement on the need to reassess the risks and benefits of hormone therapy. Yesterday, after The Washington Post published an article about the meeting, the health institutes put a notice on its Web site (www4.od.nih.gov/orwh) saying the meeting would take place but providing no details. Increased concerns about hormone replacement therapy and the labeling of the drugs arose in July after the health institutes abruptly halted a large clinical trial of Prempro, a combination of estrogen and progestin made by Wyeth. Women taking the drug had slightly more cases of breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes than those taking a placebo, and those risks were not counterbalanced by the drug's benefits, a slight decrease in the incidence of hip fractures and colon cancer. Another arm of the trial, involving women taking estrogen alone, is continuing because the evidence shows neither an overwhelming risk nor an overwhelming benefit. Women who have had hysterectomies generally take estrogen without progestin. For others, taking estrogen alone can lead to uterine cancer.
Doctors at Martha's Vineyard Hospital, the only hospital on the small island off Massachusetts, knew only one drug had been shown to work for stroke, tPA. But, until they adopted a new telemedicine system for hospitals like theirs, they had not been giving it to the 25 or so stroke patients they cared for each year. One problem was the availability of specialists. Ideally, to give tPA, an emergency room doctor should confer with a neurologist to decide whether a patient is having a stroke and whether tPA would help. That, said Dr. Timothy Tsai, director of emergency medicine at the hospital, was all but impossible. The island, with a year-round population of 15,000 and a summer population of about 120,000, has one general neurologist with an office-based practice. She cannot rush to the hospital for stroke patients, and no one covers for her when she leaves the island. To have a neurologist always available, the hospital would have to hire the equivalent of two and a half neurologists, said Timothy Walsh, the hospital's chief executive. They would be idle most of the time while costing more than a half-million dollars.
''Coronary narrowings are pervasive, endemic in our society,'' Dr. Topol said. But even as the scans are being evaluated at major medical centers, doctors in private practice are offering them to patients. Dr. Dowe, the radiologist, conducts such tests. He said he had done about 1,000, many on people with no symptoms of heart disease but who are at risk. Insurers, including Medicare, pay him $700 a scan for patients with symptoms, he said. As the insurers instructed, he bills for a CT angiogram of the chest. When Dr. Dowe sees plaque that is growing in the artery wall, a sign of developing heart disease, but no narrowings, he advises medical management for the patient, like cholesterol-lowering drugs or drugs to control blood pressure. The scan can be a real impetus to start a treatment, or stick with one, he said. Dr. Topol said there was no justification for scanning people at risk of heart disease, but with no symptoms. ''I wouldn't have imagined that this could have gone so far already in the wrong direction,'' he said.
For example, a 125-pound woman riding for an hour on a flat road and covering 18 miles burns 555 calories. Running for an hour, at 8 minutes a mile, she would burn a little over 600 calories. (Armstrong burns about 1,000 calories an hour in the Tour de France, going about 80 miles a day at an average of 24 m.p.h., Mr. Carmichael said.) On the other hand, runners rarely run for an hour and bicyclists rarely ride for less than an hour. One reason cyclists can go for such long stretches is that riding rarely leads to injuries. ''Any repetitive motion can result in an overuse injury,'' Dr. Berry said. ''And obviously cycling is a repetitive motion.'' But in bicycling ''there are no sudden impact forces that the skeleton needs to absorb.'' Knee pain and sore buttocks are the bane of inexperienced cyclists, but most serious riders avoid them. Such problems arise, bicycling experts say, because people tend to make exactly the wrong decisions about the height of their bike's seat and its design.
Dr. Freedman said it would be ridiculous to demand evidence that mammography lowers the overall death rate. The reason, he said, is that breast cancer accounts for only 1 to 3 percent of deaths among women, making it impossible to see such an effect even if lives are saved. ''Mammography is not like aspirin and headache,'' he said. ''The evidence is complicated. But the advice I would give someone is to get screened.'' Dr. Robert A. Smith, the director of the division of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society, defended the studies criticized by the investigators in Denmark. ''The trials have been gone over with a very, very critical eye by a lot of people,'' he said. ''Although people differ in terms of which ones they prefer, most people would never have dismissed five out of seven as unworthy of consideration.'' Dr. Smith said the cancer society would examine the new report as part of a previously scheduled review of publications on mammography. But, he said, ''I do not see anything in the Olsen and Gotzsche analysis that would lead the review committee to question the evidence and wisdom of routine screening mammography for women 40 and older.''
How could the idea of the placebo effect be so prevalent if it does not exist? For the same reason, it seems, that those alligator stories spread. The Danish researchers happened to notice that the placebo effect had a sort of hearsay quality in medical papers. As they grew more intrigued, they found layer after layer of cross-references in scientific publications. Finally, the found the source: a 1955 paper, ''The Powerful Placebo,'' by an anesthesiologist, Henry Beecher, at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Dr. Beecher examined 15 studies that compared a placebo to an active drug. Using a method of analysis that would not be accepted today, he chose the subset of patients who improved with a placebo, and disregarded those who got worse. From that, he concluded that about a third of patients get better simply from taking a dummy pill. ''He came up with the magical 35 percent figure that has entered placebo mythology,'' said Dr. Asbjorn Hrobjartsson, one of the Danish scientists.
The Federal Communications Commission has set standards for the maximum amount of microwave, or radiofrequency, radiation that cell phones can emit. In a published statement, the commission explained that while the federal government continues to assess research on cell-phone safety, studies have led ''expert organizations to conclude that typical RF exposures from these devices are safe.'' The cancer institute's study, directed by Dr. Peter Inskip and Dr. Martha S. Linet, involved 782 patients with brain tumors or with benign tumors of the lining of the brain or of the acoustic nerve, which connects the brain to the ear. The researchers compared their cell-phone use with that of 799 patients who were of the same sex, age and race but who did not have brain tumors. The other, smaller, study, led by Dr. Joshua E. Muscat of the American Health Foundation, a private, nonprofit research organization in Valhalla, N.Y., compared the cell-phone use of 469 brain cancer patients with that of 422 patients who were of the same age, sex and race but who did not have brain cancer.
Stroke patients, unlike heart attack patients, are not moneymakers. Because of the way medical care is reimbursed, most hospitals either lose money or do little more than break even with stroke care but can often make several thousand dollars opening the arteries of a heart attack patient. And being a stroke center means finding and paying stroke specialists to be available around the clock. Soon another problem emerged. As many as a third of the patients refused to let the ambulance take them to a stroke center, demanding to go to their local hospital. ''By law in Texas, we cannot take that man to another hospital against his will,'' Dr. Persse said. ''We could be charged with assault and battery and kidnapping and unlawful imprisonment.'' The Joint Commission, which accredits hospitals, recently started certifying stroke centers, requiring that the hospitals be willing to treat stroke patients aggressively. But only 322 of the 4,280 accredited hospitals in the nation qualify, and most patients and doctors have no idea whether a hospital nearby is among them. (The list is available on the site http://www.jointcommission.org/CertificationPrograms/Disease-SpecificCare/DSCOrgs/ under ''primary stroke centers.'') Some states, like New York, Massachusetts and Florida, do their own certifying of stroke centers.
The Food and Drug Administration said yesterday that it had decided to defer its decision on whether to allow silicone breast implants back onto the market, citing the need for more information about the implants' safety and rate of failure. In what it termed a ''not approvable letter,'' the agency notified Inamed of Santa Barbara, Calif., a maker of silicone implants that had an application pending, that it needed to do more studies and provide more information. The surprise move occurred less than three months after the agency's expert panel conducted hearings, attended by vocal opponents and proponents, and then voted 9 to 6 to recommend approval. Many of the concerns raised at the hearings were similar to those raised by the F.D.A. in its deferral. In particular, the agency wanted to know more about why implants sometimes rupture or leak, how women can know if their device has failed and what are the consequences of broken or leaking implants. Should women have frequent magnetic resonance imaging tests to look for silicone implant ruptures that remain confined to scar tissue surrounding the implant? Should the device be removed? What happens if they leave it in?
Two large studies have found that a cancer screening test that was supposed to find tumors in babies at a time when they could be treated was a failure. The test was looking for one of the most deadly childhood cancers, neuroblastoma, before the tumors had spread. While missing deadly cancers, it found ones that would never have caused problems and might never have been noticed if not for the test. The test never came into widespread use in the United States, although there was some call for it to be adopted. But it is used to examine all babies in Japan. The new studies, in Germany and Quebec, were meant to assess the test before doctors around the world began using it. As a consequence, cancer experts said they would not advocate screening for this cancer but would rely on finding the disease when it led to symptoms. While neuroblastoma is one of the most common cancers in children, it remains a rare disease, found in about 1 of every 7,000 children under the age of 5.
''We made a calculated decision that it would be worth sacrificing the branch to secure the main vessel,'' Dr. Pande said. But, fortunately, they were able to insert another balloon through the stent and into the small artery, opening it too. At 4:43, the procedure was over and Mr. Orr was wheeled to the coronary intensive care unit. He had been awake but sedated and experienced what he said was the amazing feeling of having his artery opened. ''As soon as the balloon goes in, all the pain disappears,'' he said. ''You know immediately.'' The cardiologists who saved his life walked out of the room, grinning and exhilarated. ''This adrenaline rush is why people like me go into cardiology,'' Dr. Pande said. The First Call: An Ambulance Mr. Orr was incredibly lucky, said Dr. Elliott Antman, director of the coronary care unit at Brigham and Women's Hospital. He ended up with little or no damage to his heart, even though he teetered between lifesaving decisions and critical miscalculations in his moments of crisis.
''I went to three continents, I visited 60 companies, but there were no takers,'' Dr. El-Rashidy said. ''Nobody, even in 1995, believed that such markets existed. And they were not sure that the F.D.A. would ever approve a product for this indication.'' Finally, in 1996, while Viagra was being studied in clinical trials, TAP Pharmaceuticals of Deerfield, Ill., agreed to test the drug. The results of studies involving 3,000 men, presented to an F.D.A. advisory committee on April 10, showed that Uprima allowed about 50 percent to have erections firm enough for intercourse.  But a dummy pill worked 30 percent of the time. The drug caused nausea, vomiting, dizziness, sweating or sleepiness in 5 percent of men. Thirteen men taking Uprima fainted. The advisory committee recommended that the drug be approved for marketing. The drug agency is not required to take its advisory committees' advice, but it usually does so.
In both cases, the investigators found, patients at community hospitals fared at least as well as those at academic medical centers. With pneumonia, for example, patients are supposed to receive antibiotics within four hours of being admitted to the hospital. ''If you go to a community hospital, you had a 72 percent chance of getting your antibiotics within four hours of hitting the door,'' Dr. Lindenauer said. ''If you go to the large teaching hospital, you have a 56 percent chance.'' ''Our study wasn't able to answer why,'' Dr. Lindenauer added, but he said he has a hunch. ''A routine case of pneumonia may not command all of the resources and personnel of the emergency room in the way it might in a community hospital.'' The study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease came to the same conclusion: The hospitals that took care of more of these patients really did no better than the hospitals that took care of fewer, he said.
In the meantime, scientists were getting more and more evidence that drugs that block COX-2 might also block cancers, including those of the colon, breast, lung, bladder, skin and esophagus. Animal studies and epidemiological studies looking at people who happened to be taking the drugs for conditions like arthritis helped bolster the case -- the drugs appeared to protect against at least some forms of cancer. Soon dozens of clinical studies of Vioxx and Celebrex got under way, with 20 Celebrex studies at the National Cancer Institute alone, involving people at high risk for cancers of the lung, breast, skin, prostate, colon, mouth, bladder and esophagus. The cancer institute also started 20 additional Celebrex studies to see if the drug could help treat patients who already had cancer. Researchers were optimistic. ''It seems to be one of the best-documented cases that chemoprevention might work for cancer,'' Dr. Vogelstein said. But all the while, some scientists had nagging concerns that COX-2 inhibitors might increase the risk of heart disease. Among them was Dr. Garret A. FitzGerald, chairman of the department of pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania.
''The best way to learn about practical problems and practical benefits,'' Dr. McClellan said, ''is to evaluate how treatments do in real world settings.'' Dr. Platt and other academic experts, as well as patient advocacy groups like the Center for Medical Consumers in New York, agree, and applaud the new Medicare initiative. It is so compelling, said Dr. Robert Califf, director of the Clinical Research Institute at Duke University, that ''almost regardless of your political philosophy, this makes sense.'' ''We have an increasingly powerful array of drugs and devices and a bewildering array of choices,'' he said. ''And there is a broad agreement among people who make these choices that we don't have the information we need.'' The dearth of information reached a crisis with cancer drugs, Dr. Tunis said, when new drugs, so-called biologics, began reaching the market. With cancer drugs, he said, the tradition is to test new medications in situations that their makers think are most likely to show benefit. That leads to approval by the F.D.A. Then the drugs often come into widespread use off-label -- doctors give them to patients with different cancers or in combination with other drugs, trying them out in new contexts. Medicare is required to pay for the original approved use and for uses listed in certain drug compendia. Other than that, Medicare payments for off-label uses are up to the discretion of local contractors to the agency. Some pay; others do not.
Dr. Giannulli's experience, repeated across the country, is one of the most remarkable stories yet of a medical technology bubble that burst, health care researchers say. It began as a sort of medical gold rush, with hundreds of scanning centers, with ceaseless direct-to-consumer advertising, and with thousands of Americans paying out of pocket for the scans, which could cost $1,000 or more. It ended abruptly with the wholesale shuttering of businesses. CT Screening International, which scanned 25,000 people at 13 centers across the nation, went out of business. AmeriScan, another national chain, also closed. So, radiologists say, did another company that put scanners in vans and traveled to small towns in the South. The business's collapse, health care researchers say, holds lessons about the workings of American medicine. It shows the limits of direct-to-consumer advertising and the power of dissuasion by professional societies, which warned against getting one of these scans. The tests, they said, would mostly find innocuous lumps in places like the thyroid or lungs, requiring rounds of additional tests to rule out real problems, and would miss common cancers, like those of the breast.
If the F.D.A. agrees, both sides say they expect enormous medical and social consequences. Dr. James Trussell of Princeton, a member of the advisory committee who voted for the motion, said he had waited for years for this day to arrive. ''It's hard to believe it actually happened,'' Dr. Trussell said. Allowing Plan B to be sold over the counter, he added, ''sends a signal to women that it is safe.'' But Dr. W. David Hager of the University of Kentucky, one of four committee members who voted against the motion, said he was worried about the implications for sexual behavior. Dr. Hager said Plan B would have a similar effect to the birth control pill, which he said ushered in ''a new day and age for the expression of sexuality among young people.'' ''What we heard today was frequently about individuals who did not want to take responsibility for their actions and wanted a medication to relieve those consequences,'' Dr. Hager said. He said he was worried in particular that it would encourage sexual activity among adolescents, who could just buy the drug on their own.
Dr. Robinson's program is no panacea --  it is pilot program that does not assume success but instead asks if success is possible. ''I feel very strongly that you don't want to create another failed experience for kids,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''There's a long history of smart and very capable researchers who have been frustrated by this problem. I want to be sure we're doing something helpful'' The Fat Epidemic Previous articles in this series examined an extreme surgical treatment for weight loss, new obesity research, exercise and weight, and chronic dieters. Later articles will investigate the psychology of eating, culture and class relationships to fat and the diet business. The series will remain available online:  www.nytimes.com/obesity
Other economists agree. ''We have to spend our money on something,'' says Robert E. Hall, a Stanford University economist. In a paper published in The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Dr. Hall and Charles I. Jones of the University of California, Berkeley, write: ''As we get older and richer, which is more valuable: a third car, yet another television, more clothing -- or an extra year of life?'' David Cutler, an economist at Harvard, calculated the value of extra spending on medicine. ''Take a typical person aged 45,'' he said. ''They will spend $30,000 more over their lifetime caring for cardiovascular disease than they would have spent in 1950. And they will live maybe three more years because of it.'' He added, ''Are you willing to do that? Yes, it costs a lot, but we're rich enough where the alternative use of the money isn't as valuable.'' Still, Victor R. Fuchs, also an economist at Stanford, notes that buying health care is fundamentally different from buying a television or a car.
One place H.I.V. hides, Dr. Siliciano said, is in a tiny fraction of the helper T-cells themselves. The virus inserts its genes among the cell's own genes, lurking silently and invisibly. ''It's latent, it's totally hidden, it is not seen by the immune system. It is stable and it is in a cell that is designed to live essentially for life,'' Dr. Siliciano said. ''And you can never remove the viral genetic material.'' Only about one in a million of this subset of helper cells, a group known as memory cells, contain H.I.V. genes, Dr. Siliciano finds. But that is enough to start an infection anew, putting patients who do not have the immune defense of Bob Massey or Jim H. in a bind. As soon as they stop taking the antiviral drugs, the virus can take over and proliferate unabated. Dr. Siliciano is trying to find ways to flush the virus out of the memory  T-cells, but he is not optimistic. ''We think this mechanism guarantees that H.I.V. will stay around indefinitely,'' he said.
People who are overweight but not obese have a lower risk of death than those of normal weight, federal researchers are reporting today. The researchers -- statisticians and epidemiologists from the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- also found that increased risk of death from obesity was seen for the most part in the extremely obese, a group constituting only 8 percent of Americans. And being very thin, even though the thinness was longstanding and unlikely to stem from disease, caused a slight increase in the risk of death, the researchers said. The new study, considered by many independent scientists to be the most rigorous yet on the effects of weight, controlled for factors like smoking, age, race and alcohol consumption in a sophisticated analysis derived from a well-known method that has been used to predict cancer risk. It also used the federal government's own weight categories, which define fatness and thinness according to a ''body mass index'' correlating weight to height, regardless of sex. For example, 5-foot-8 people weighing less than 122 pounds are underweight. If they weighed 122 to 164 pounds, their weight would be normal. They would be overweight at 165 to 196, obese at 197 to 229, and extremely obese at 230 or over.
Last week, when a large federal study on hormone replacement therapy came to an abrupt halt, Cheryl Kipfer's husband handed her a news report on the stunning findings. The drugs, the report said, had risks, including invasive breast cancer, which, although slight, were not counterbalanced by benefits. Ms. Kipfer said her husband, Gary, told her she was crazy. ''Why,'' she said he asked her, ''are you taking those pills?'' Then her daughter sent her an e-mail message, attaching another report with the same bad news. She wrote, ''I want you to read this and I want you to know that I love you.'' But Ms. Kipfer, 56, a retired school administrator who lives in Omaha, does not know what to do. Her bones were markedly thinned from osteoporosis, and her doctor told her the only thing keeping them from eroding further was the hormone replacement therapy she takes each day.
Now, he said, with the collapse of some of the South Korean scientists' research, the situation may change. ''In one sense, this puts us back to where we were before May of 2005, when there still was some uncertainty about whether this would work at all,'' Mr. Doerflinger said. ''In another sense it does illustrate in my mind how hype and ambition have gotten ahead of the science.'' ''How am I going to exploit it?'' he said. ''You don't have to. It's just speaking for itself.'' News Analysis Correction:  December 17, 2005, Saturday  Because of an editing error, a news analysis yesterday about a colleague's statement impugning the stem cell research of Dr. Hwang Woo Suk, a South Korean scientist, misstated what Dr. Hwang said about it last month. Dr. Hwang admitted then that an error had been made in submitting photographs that accompanied an article about his research, but he has not publicly admitted that he fabricated evidence, and has defended his research.
A single infusion of an intestinal hormone made people eat less for the rest of the day, regardless of whether they were fat or thin, researchers are reporting today. The hormone, PYY (for peptide YY 3-36), is of particular interest because it appears to be the intestine's signal of satiety and because overweight people normally make less of it than thin people. Researchers are trying to learn whether some people grow fat because they do not produce enough of it and thus get only a weak chemical signal to stop eating. In the study, whose results appear today in The New England Journal of Medicine, 24 volunteers, half of them overweight and half of them lean, received PYY or a saltwater placebo at 8:30 a.m. An hour and a half later, they were ushered in to a buffet lunch. On average, those who had received PYY ate 30 percent less.
Fort Detrick's scientists are overwhelmed by requests from the Federal Bureau of Investigation for testing for anthrax spores, said Chuck Dasey, a spokesman there, and have had to delay animal tests of drugs or vaccines indefinitely.  Companies like EluSys have to wait in an increasingly long line. And that, medical experts say, is just one of the frustrating problems they face as they cope with a newly urgent problem of finding drugs to treat diseases that may be spread by bioterrorists. Another problem is figuring out what evidence the Food and Drug Administration will  require to approve the drugs. A third, which arose with anthrax, is the issue of whether to try treating anthrax with drugs that look promising but that have been studied or approved only for other diseases. F.D.A. regulations are a real problem, said Dr. Frank Young, a member of the board of EluSys and a former commissioner of the drug agency. Human testing to show effectiveness is required for all drugs. But it would be unethical to give healthy volunteers anthrax in order to test a drug. And anthrax has been too rare for tests on people who got the disease naturally. So, in 1999, the F.D.A. solicited comments on a new rule that would accept animal studies as proof of a drug's effectiveness against bioterrorism agents. But the rule has not yet been made final.
He understands the concern. ''There is a sense of fear and desperation and concern that spills over into calls for various interventions that look sensible but may not be,'' he said. And, he added, those interventions should not be imposed without first showing they have an effect. Dr. Leibel and other skeptics say they are not surprised that, even with two studies showing the ineffectiveness of intervention in schools, communities continue to mandate those same changes. Scientists and the public, said David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California at Berkeley, ''have this wonderful capacity for ignoring negative evidence.'' Dr. Freedman, who has written books on the science and history of clinical trials, says he is reminded of a story about a pioneer in the medical application of statistics, Pierre-Charles-Alexandre Louis. In the 1830's, Dr. Louis studied the effect of bloodletting, or bleeding -- the standard treatment of the time -- on pneumonia.
Doctors fall into two broad groups, said Dr. Harvey Alter (who is not related to Dr. Miriam Alter) , chief of the infectious disease section at the National Institutes of Health. ''One group says you cannot predict the outcome of hepatitis C, therefore it is safest to treat everyone,'' he said. ''The other group feels that most people are not badly affected and that this disease progresses slowly.'' If doctors follow the patients, Dr. Alter said, ''it is safe to wait and see if there is significant progression,'' before starting treatment. ''The dilemma is only because the treatment is difficult,'' Dr. Alter said. ''If we had a safe and effective oral treatment, we would treat everybody.'' But, for now, the question of whether to treat, and whom to treat, hinges on the larger question of how bad hepatitis C is. And that question hinges on studies of people like Mr. Woodland.
THE fairy tale about science says that cheaters will quickly get caught. And if a result is wrong or faked, a scientist's collaborators will be the first to know. If only it were that simple. Last week, after an investigative panel announced that a series of remarkable physics papers were based on faked data, it became clear that when fraud occurs, the best scientists can be fooled by their own colleagues. Yet there are no clear rules about whether a scientist's co-authors bear responsibility. The research questioned last week was conducted by Dr. J. Hendrik Sch√∂n, a scientist at Bell Labs. From 1998 to 2001, he published 17 papers -- including claims last fall that Bell Labs had created molecular-scale transistors -- in the most prestigious scientific journals with a total of 20 co-authors. From time to time, outside scientists said they had tried, and failed, to replicate Dr. Sch√∂n's results. But an investigation was launched only after a few physicists noticed that he had published identical graphs in different papers.
Yesterday, 10 health organizations, including the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Cancer Society, ran a full-page advertisement in The New York Times advising women to continue to have mammograms. ''We have grave concerns that these public debates have already begun to erode the confidence in mammography that has been built up over the past two decades,'' they wrote. The American Society of Clinical Oncology, announced yesterday that it was convening a panel of experts to assess the data. The United States Preventive Services Task Force, an independent but government-financed group that issues screening guidelines, is also preparing a report. An article in The Lancet today says that, according to another new analysis, mammography screening  prevents breast cancer deaths if studies go on long enough. Other countries are wrestling with the issue. The Swedish Board of Health and Welfare is to meet this month to decide whether to continue national screening, and in March, a World Health Association panel is expected to take up the question.
It is almost impossible to tell the blunt truth about the success rates of treatments, some researchers said. ''It is like resisting Mom, apple pie, and the flag,'' said Dr. Bruce Schneider, associate vice president for clinical research at the Association of American Medical Colleges. Many said they know the data but encourage patients to continue trying to lose some weight, or at least stop gaining, especially those whose blood sugar level is elevated or who have joint problems that are worsened by weighing so much. Clearly, doctors have not yet given up on the idea that weight loss may improve health. Yet, they said, when they urge patients to lower their expectations about how much weight they can lose, some react with shock. Dr. Judith Korner, an endocrinologist at Columbia University, tells obese patients that a 5 percent to 10 percent weight loss would be terrific. ''Some of them look at me as though I'm crazy,'' she said.
Dr. Eugene Shapiro of Yale University School of Medicine, who wrote an accompanying editorial, noted that the antibiotic often caused nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain and that among those who took it, there would have been very little chance of getting Lyme disease in any case. People who are bitten can watch the site where the tick fed, Dr. Shapiro said, and if they develop a rash within a few weeks, they can take a full course of antibiotics. ''Give that person 10 to 21 days of antibiotics,'' he said, ''and they will be fine.'' Dr. Sigal agreed. He added that deer ticks crawl around the body for hours before settling down to feed, and during that time are easily washed off with a washcloth. And, he said, ''even if you get the disease, it is easily treatable and it is curable.'' But Dr. Jesse L. Goodman, a Lyme disease expert at the University of Minnesota, said some people were so horrified by the possibility of getting Lyme disease that even a 3 percent risk was too much for them.
But when Ms. Buchanan received a diagnosis of breast cancer a few years ago, she stayed with the local doctor who found her tumor, Dr. Rachel P. Dultz, at University Medical Center, a community hospital in Princeton, N.J. She just had a good, warm feeling about Dr. Dultz, she said, and could not imagine that she would receive better care from anyone else. ''If I went to a Sloan-Kettering, I'm sure there are fabulous people there, but you've got to have total confidence in the person who's going to be taking care of you,'' Ms. Buchanan said. Patsy Brandt of Cherry Hill, N.J., came to the opposite conclusion. She went to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, and never investigated any other options for her breast cancer treatment. ''It's sort of a no-brainer when one lives in a doable radius of a major teaching and research hospital,'' Mrs. Brandt said.
Another difficulty is that most frozen embryos are from older women who had trouble conceiving, said Dr. Jacob Mayer, director of the embryology lab at the Jones Institute. Their embryos are less likely to grow, he said, and stem cells derived from them may be of lesser quality. Dr. Barry Behr, who directs the in vitro fertilization laboratory at Stanford University and at four other California fertility centers, said that if he wanted to make stem cells, he would do the same thing the Jones Institute scientists did. ''The few dribs and drabs of embryos that are released by our patients are never going to be enough to generate high-quality cells,'' Dr. Behr said. ''By far, by far, the vast majority of embryos that are frozen are not good. If we thawed 10,000 embryos, we would get 100 or so that are viable blastocysts.'' But although the chances of frozen embryos being viable are small, fertility experts say, patients and their doctors still cherish every one.
Others decided against taking the pills. Dr. Kava, of the American Council on Science and Health, said she abstained. ''People ask me what vitamins I take,'' she said. ''I say I don't take any. They look at me askance. They can't believe I'm a nutritionist.'' Dr. Caballero also does not take vitamins. ''There is no disease I know of that is prevented by multivitamins,'' he said. In fact, Dr. Caballero said, typical pills, which contain a variety of minerals as well as vitamins, have ingredients that actually cancel out one another. ''Minerals antagonize each other for absorption,'' he said. ''Zinc competes with iron which competes with calcium.'' Dr. Caballero also notes that large, rigorous studies that were supposed to show that individual vitamins prevented disease ended up showing the opposite. Those who took the vitamins actually had more of the disease it was meant to prevent. Two large randomized trials of vitamin A and beta carotene that researchers hoped would show a protective value against cancer found no benefit, and one found that participants who took the supplements had more cancer.
With esophageal cancer, for example, ''you literally double your odds by going to a high-volume center,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. The five-year survival rate for patients going to hospitals that did four or fewer esophageal operations a year was 17 percent. The five-year survival rate for patients going to hospitals that did more than 14 operations a year was 34 percent. Dr. Robert J. Downey, a thoracic surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he stopped doing operations for esophageal cancer because he was doing only about one a month, not enough, he decided, for optimal results. Yet Dr. Birkmeyer's study finds that fully a third of patients have the operation at hospitals doing four or fewer such surgeries in a year. It may not matter, Dr. Downey said, whether someone with esophageal cancer ''goes to a Memorial Sloan-Kettering or a Columbia-Presbyterian,'' two of New York's teaching hospitals. What matters, he said, is whether they go to a hospital that does more than just a few operations. With breast cancer, Dr. Birkmeyer said, women who go to medical centers that see large numbers of such patients tend to live longer than women who go to centers that see fewer.
Dr. Hodes confesses that in this case indirect studies may be the best that can be done. To obtain direct evidence would require randomly assigning some participants to keep hearing negative comments about themselves as they age and others to hear positive things. ''How ethical would that be?'' he asks. If it is true that perceptions of aging affect memory, behavior and health -- and many researchers are betting that they do -- that may bode well for today's middle-age people, Dr. Levy says. They may not be quite so willing to declare themselves old when they reach their 60's and beyond and they may be less likely to believe the stereotypes of old age. Still, Dr. Levy and others say, it can be difficult to resist the pervasive stereotypes of aging. Many people may accept them without realizing it. ''Then they become a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' Dr. Levy said. But not for people like Dr. Butler or Mr. Bialokur, who managed to escape that trap. Others, too, say they have thrived simply by ignoring the stereotypes.
A study sponsored by Pfizer, reported last month, indicated that lower may be better. Plaque growth stopped in heart patients whose L.D.L. levels dropped to about 80 while it slowly continued in those with levels of about 110. Other studies are asking whether lower levels of L.D.L. lead to fewer heart attacks. Dr. Christie Ballantyne, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at Baylor, cautioned that it was prudent for policy makers to wait for those studies to be completed. But he added that high-risk patients and their doctors might come to their own conclusions. ''Why not get L.D.L. lower?'' he asked. ''The argument is becoming compelling.'' Dr. H. Bryan Brewer Jr., chief of the molecular diseases branch at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, agreed. ''Our clear projection is that lower is going to be better,'' Dr. Brewer said. But that, he said, ''will make the challenge even greater.'' After all, if most Americans with high cholesterol levels are not reducing them to the current recommended levels, what good will it do to ask them to go even lower?
Dr. Gleicher said he felt otherwise. He said he was prompted to ask about using preimplantation genetic diagnosis for sex selection when the reproductive medicine society issued a statement in May that it was ethical to use a different method --  sperm sorting -- for that purpose. One center, the Genetics and IVF Institute in Fairfax, Va., is using a sperm-sorting technique that allows it to pick out the vast majority of male sperm. The reproductive medicine society said that if a couple already had one child and wanted to use the method to select the sex of subsequent children, that was ethically permissible. But, Dr. Gleicher said, if sperm sorting is all right for sex selection, why prohibit preimplantation diagnosis for sex selection? ''How can you say that a method that would be 100 percent reliable is not ethically acceptable?'' he asked. He brought the question to his own ethics board.
''One day in a graduate class, I made a comment that the local cycling team was training wrong for an event,'' he said. It was a race like the one in the movie ''Breaking Away,'' in which a team's members would take turns sprinting around a track for 80 laps. They were training by riding long distances, without training for speed. Dr. Burke was a student in the class, and he told Dr. Costill that his fraternity team, which had performed miserably in the race the last year, would like to try Dr. Costill's method. Would he train them? Dr. Costill said he would. One student that Dr. Burke recruited to join the team that year was his roommate, Tom Doughty. Mr. Doughty had never raced a bicycle before, but he turned out to be a natural, so good that he went on to become a national champion in individual and team trial bicycling and qualified for the 1980 Olympic bicycling team.
In that context, cancer experts informally agreed upon a convention: When a P.S.A. test finds more than four nanograms of the protein in a milliliter of blood, doctors usually recommend biopsies to see if cancer is present; needles are inserted into the prostate to withdraw cells for analysis. When a biopsy finds cancer, almost all men opt for treatment, usually surgery or radiation to destroy the prostate gland. But the new study, being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, reports that as many as 15 percent of men with P.S.A. levels less than 4 had cancer when their prostates were assessed with biopsies. While higher P.S.A. levels confer greater risk, there appears to be no level at which there is no risk of prostate cancer, said the lead investigator, Dr. Ian M. Thompson, chief of urology at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio.
''If I had to choose between all my creams and makeup for looking and feeling good,'' Ms. Hutton advised, ''I'd take the estrogen.'' Audrey Ashby, a spokeswoman for Wyeth Ayerst, said: ''Lauren Hutton speaks her mind about what she believes in. But she is a spokesperson, not for Premarin, but for an unbranded ad that discusses the consequences of menopause and estrogen loss.'' Some women who refuse to take the drug say they constantly have to explain themselves. ''Everyone I know takes it, practically without exception,'' Dr. Nestle said. She does not, she says, because, ''I read the medical literature and I prefer to be cautious.'' Now Dr. Nestle feels vindicated. The disconcerting finding on heart disease arose in a study, known as the Hormone Replacement Therapy Trial of the Women's Health Initiative, that involves about 25,000 healthy postmenopausal women. They were randomly assigned to take hormone replacement therapy or a dummy medication.
The new initiative by Boston University could be a boon to medical science, said Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. There is no study like the one in Framingham, with more than 12,000 participants who have faithfully come in over the years for regular medical exams and have willingly provided all the information that investigators request. The problem has been taking that vast and complex set of data and extracting information from it. ''We have 50 years of data that are sitting in a basement,'' Dr. Lenfant said. ''If somebody wants to do this, more power to them. I think it's terrific to have the data used. I'm all for it.'' Dr. Lenfant emphasied that the heart institute would insist that the Framingham data continue to be freely available apart from the new company, that the confidentially of the study participants be maintained and that the Boston University investigators who administer the Framingham study have no financial ties to the new company. Dr. Fred Ledley, chief executive officer of Framingham Genomic Medicine, said he had already taken care of Dr. Lenfant's concerns.
The story of the operation, health economists say, is a case study of the troubling and thorny questions that Medicare administrators face as they try to live within the constraints of the $267.8 billion-a-year federal program. Some say the operation can transform patients' lives. ''If your parents had this condition, you would seek this operation for them,'' said Dr. Joel Cooper, a lung surgeon at Washington University in St. Louis who developed the operation. Others point to a recent study indicating that its benefits are modest, at best. But all agree that the patients are severely ill, with no other options. And all agree that the operation is expensive. A recent analysis showed that patients who had the operation had medical bills averaging nearly $63,000 the first year, compared with $13,000 for similar patients who had not had it. Estimates of the number of potential patients vary from 1 percent to 15 percent of the nation's two million emphysema patients, or as many as 300,000 people, at a total cost of $1 billion to $15 billion.
He is now starting to analyze the virus in different tissues taken from patients in autopsies. These are people who are part of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, a collaborative study that began in the early 1980's and has been following several thousand gay men. It is far too early to know if the approach will succeed, Dr. O'Brien said. And, of course, the project is an expensive gamble since it may turn out that the virus mutates so quickly or so slowly that it is impossible to trace its path. But, Dr. O'Brien adds, he has reason to hope: ''We're very encouraged by what we're seeing.'' AIDS AT 20  Correction:  June 9, 2001, Saturday  An article and a picture caption in Science Times on Tuesday about progress in AIDS research misspelled the surname and misstated the age of a man with hemophilia who has been infected for 23 years with H.I.V. He is Robert Massie, not Massey. He is 44, not 46.
As bone scanning took off, new problems emerged, including what constitutes low bone density in men. With women, the standard comparison is to the bone density of a 30-year-old white woman. Comparing men's bones to those of a 30-year-old white man means that nearly half of all middle-aged men have osteopenia, said Dr. Anne Looker of the National Center for Health Statistics. But men have just 35 percent the risk of hip fractures as women. There also are questions of what different machines are measuring. The first scans were with X-rays, known as Dexa, for dual-energy X-ray abosorptiometry. Newer cheap and portable scanners use ultrasound, and portable X-ray machines measure density in the heel. But a Merck study directed by Dr. Siris found that the prevalence of osteopenia varied from 28 to 45 percent depending on the type of machine. Then comes the question of whom to treat. While osteoporosis drugs do slow bone loss, it has been difficult to show that they prevent fractures in people with osteopenia, maybe because their fracture rate is already so low. ''If people aren't having fractures,'' Dr. McClung said, ''you can't prevent them.''
After 18 months, the atorvastatin patients had no change in the plaque in their arteries. But plaque increased by 2.7 percent in pravastatin patients. The study did not assess patient outcomes like heart attacks and deaths, which would have required 8,000 patients and taken five or more years. Pfizer sponsored the study, but Dr. Nissen, who prides himself on his independence from financial conflicts of interest, insisted that he control the study and its data analysis, and had the right by contract to publish the results whether positive or negative for Pfizer. He described the results yesterday at the American Heart Association meeting in Orlando, Fla., and submitted a paper for publication. ''A lot of people thought all statins were the same,'' he said in a telephone interview. If the two statins had turned out to be about equal, Pfizer might have lost in the multibillion-dollar statin market because pravastatin is nearing the end of its patent life and generic versions should be cheaper.
Dr. Bernards, sounding almost like a predeterminist of a half century ago, remarked that if a tumor had a bad signature, early diagnosis might not help. ''The cat may be already out of the bag,'' he said. In their paper, the group said the same thing in the formal language of science: ''Our findings argue against the widely accepted idea that metastatic potential is acquired relatively late during multistep tumorigenesis.'' That statement, they added, ''theoretically limits the benefit of early detection and treatment.'' Dr. Goodman pointed out that the small tumors found in the study had already gone through hundreds of cell divisions. During those divisions, they may have passed from harmless to lethal. The idea that tumors pick up mutations along the way that allow them to kill may still be true, he said, but many tumors may make that change when they are too small for a mammogram to see.
''With a lot of people, slow walking is due to poor blood flow in the legs,'' Dr. Newman says. ''Then their muscles atrophy.'' And reduced blood flow to the brain, she says, can make people feel sluggish and depleted and unable to move quickly. Cardiovascular disease may be why Mrs. Bower became frail. For 60 years, she says, she has had diabetes, a disease that damages blood vessels. So even though she has not had a heart attack or a stroke, blood flow to her muscles, heart and brain may be impeded, researchers say. If they are right about frailty, Dr. Newman and others say, then the condition may be prevented or delayed by not smoking and keeping cholesterol and blood pressure levels low and by staying active. But, the researchers add, their finding may be good news for today's middle-age people who had the advantage of drugs to control their blood pressure and cholesterol levels before serious damage to blood vessels set in. And many are more active than their parents were when they were middle age.
Obesity researchers say they know the phenomenon all too well. Weight loss can be like a religious epiphany. Someone loses weight on a diet. They are ecstatic and want to share the good news. ''These people are believers,'' says Dr. Gary D. Foster, director of the weight and eating disorders program at the University of Pennsylvania. Diet books are written in the same spirit. ''Evangelism creeps in,'' he said. ''It's a way of marketing why this diet is different.'' The arguments over diet go way back, said Dr. Rudolph L. Leibel, an obesity researcher at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. ''They are in fact an echo of the discredited scientific notion of vitalism,'' he said of the idea that living things are not governed by the laws of chemistry and physics. Although vitalism was disproved 200 years ago, he said, it is behind the fevered search for a magic way of eating that can override the rigid scientific formula: calories in minus calories out govern weight gain and weight loss. Discovering a diet, Dr. Leibel says, ''is almost like a revelation.''
Cancer prevention has become a buzzword these days, with some medical centers, like M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, planning entire buildings just for prevention. Its center will open in about a year, big as eight and a half football fields. But even cancer experts who are participating in the new prevention efforts are divided on what really can be done to prevent cancer, other than stopping smoking. Looking at the same data on prevention, some experts say that for now most efforts involve research that may or may not lead to clinical advances. That is a problem emblematic of the fiercely competitive world of cancer medicine, doctors say. Medical centers need to attract patients and federal research money. And that means they need to be on the cutting edge of the field. The National Institutes of Health requires medical centers that are designated comprehensive cancer centers, and eligible for its grants and contracts, to have a prevention component. The institute devoted $500 million, or 12 percent of its budget, to cancer prevention and control.
Using seven of the monkey embryos created by direct sperm injection into eggs, Dr. Schatten and his colleagues tried to create pregnancies and got a set of stillborn twins and one live male monkey. The scientists have not found evidence that the gene was incorporated into any of the monkeys' cells. But, they and others say, they have no doubt that the method will work, because it was recently shown to work in mice. Earlier this year, in the journal Science, Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi at the University of Hawaii and his colleagues reported that they had mixed the same jellyfish gene with mouse sperm, injected the sperm into mouse eggs and created pregnancies. They reported that 11 of the 57 mice that were born had the jellyfish gene: when they examined cells from the animals' tail tips under a fluorescent light, the cells glowed green. Dr. Yanagimachi said that while he was disappointed that the first monkeys did not have the added gene, ''this is just a matter of time before it can be done.''
In the case of prostate cancer, Dr. Wilt is directing a study that is designed to find a decrease in the overall death rate, if it exists. The study involves 731 men whose cancers were found early, with a P.S.A. screening test and who were randomly assigned to have their prostates removed or not. After 12 years, the researchers expect to see an effect if there is one. ''We felt that if we haven't been able to show an increase in survival, then you have to wonder about the importance of the treatment,'' Dr. Wilt said. Dr. Wilt's study, of course, is the ideal. ''Everyone would say, boy, that's what I really wish I had,'' Dr. Goodman said. ''The greater debate is, What do you do in the absence of such data?'' At the very least, Dr. Welch said, ''if it's such a small difference that you can't see it in the overall mortality, then patients ought to know that. If it's that close a call, maybe they will make a different decision.''
Those few who succeed at weight loss may end up on what amounts to a permanent diet. People in a national registry of successful dieters -- they maintained a weight loss of at least 30 pounds for at least a year -- report consuming just 1,400 calories a day and walking, or doing equivalent exercise, for an hour a day. Still, people who lost weight said they felt better, they looked better, and they found just moving around and going about their daily lives much easier. That leaves a question, Dr. Hirsch said. ''If it's all that good, why don't people maintain their weight loss?'' Mr. Pirollo, who lost 30 pounds since March, said he was confident he would reach his goal and that this time his weight loss would last. He would like insurers to pay but his latest treatment as a participant in a two-year clinical trial costs him nothing. Already, Mr. Pirollo reports, his doctor halved his dose of blood pressure medication.
Enshrined in textbooks, taught in schools and rarely questioned was one truism of medicine: the only organs that can regenerate their cells are the bone marrow, the liver and, maybe, the kidney. But now, researchers say, they are not so sure. To their astonishment, scientists at Harvard Medical School recently discovered that in mice, the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas could regenerate. Other experts, at New York Medical College, just reported compelling evidence that human hearts can grow new cells. The findings have enormous implications, scientists say, although it can be a long and harrowing path from observations like these to medical treatments. The encouraging news is that the body has an unappreciated capacity to repair itself. But in making that discovery, researchers also found a potential therapeutic stumbling block: an underlying disease, like diabetes, which kills pancreas cells, may outpace the regeneration of those cells. Even adding new cells, like ones derived from sources like stem cells, may be futile. To regenerate tissues and organs, it may be necessary first to cure an underlying disease.
''Let's say there are 100 studies on a drug and one of those studies says the drug has an effect on cancer,'' Dr. Kessler said. ''Ninety-nine studies show the drug does not have such effects. It is a accurate statement that a study has found that the drug affects tumors. But it is not true.'' That is why, Dr. Kessler said, the F.D.A. insists on evaluating all the relevant scientific data. It is the reason for its regulations on what can be on food and drug labels, what companies can say about drugs and medical devices that are not yet approved for marketing, what they can say about unapproved uses for their products and what they can say when they advertise drugs to consumers. The concern that the statements be true, not just accurate, he said, is why the agency ''requires companies and the agency to look at all the data and base their statements not on whether something is technically accurate but whether it is supported by the weight of the evidence.''
The babies treated by Dr. Fischer had a rare disorder known as severe combined immunodeficiency-X1, or SCID-X1, which almost exclusively affects boys, occurring once in every 75,000 live male births. It is caused by mutations that destroy the function of a gene that is needed to make T cells, a class of white blood cells. In a sense, the condition is a perfect target for gene therapy. With SCID-X1, the cells that need a new gene are readily accessible in the bone marrow, whose cells are relatively easy to remove from the body. Even better, if functioning genes actually get into the marrow cells of patients with SCID-X1, those genetically corrected cells will proliferate and displace cells with the defective gene. That is because, as the body tries to grow a complete immune system, it sends waves of chemical signals to the bone marrow to stimulate it into providing T cells.
Dr. Wilber also has another plan up his sleeve to help athletes -- including those without asthma -- compete while breathing Beijing's polluted air. But he prefers not to reveal it to the outside world. ''There's a fine line amongst all of us internationally,'' he said. ''They're not going to tell us everything they're doing. and I'm not going to tell them everything we're doing.'' ''That's medals for us,'' he said. ''not them.'' Correction:  July 31, 2006, Monday  An article in Science Times on July 18 about new training techniques for marathon runners in the Olympics and other games included an incorrect reference from an exercise researcher to a legal tactic called glycerin loading, which takes advantage of glycerin's ability to absorb water from the body and gradually release it during a race. The technique was used by three American men in the 1992 Olympics at Barcelona, as the article noted; it was not used by an American woman, Cathy O'Brien.
Dr. Schatzkin, who directed the study in which subjects ate either diets high in fiber, including fruits and vegetables, or their ordinary diets, said the fiber hypothesis might still turn out to be true. ''You could say diet works earlier -- before they develop the first polyp,'' he said. ''Or maybe diet works later in the process.'' But the leader of the second study, Dr. David S. Alberts, director of cancer prevention at the University of Arizona's Cancer Center, said, ''I think we've definitely disproved the fiber hypothesis for colon cancer.''
At first, Plan B was sold only to groups like public health clinics and Planned Parenthood. But about two months ago the company put the pills into commercial distribution. It does not yet have sales figures from pharmacies. The company says that within the next year it will apply to the F.D.A. to sell Plan B over the counter. For 25 years, doctors have known that women can prevent most pregnancies by taking high doses of birth control pills within 72 hours after having unprotected intercourse -- the exact number of pills needed varied depending on the brand. Ordinarily, 8 out of 100 women who have unprotected intercourse during the second or third week of their menstrual cycle will become pregnant. But if they take high doses of birth control pills, just two will become pregnant. Medical experts say that a fetus is not harmed if a women takes emergency contraceptives and remains pregnant, and for that reason most experts say that women do not need pregnancy tests before taking the pill. The exact reason why the pills work is not established, Dr. Trussell said, although one thought is that they alter the uterine lining, making it inhospitable to a fertilized egg.
The investigators are continuing to study Celebrex to see if cancers as well as polyps are prevented in F.A.P. patients. In the meantime, however, they stress that F.A.P. patients will still need surgery. ''It is not good enough to replace surgery,'' said Dr. Bertagnolli, the colon cancer specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Dr. Bertagnolli, who will lead the new study seeking to prevent colon cancer in the general population, is also a consultant to Searle. For Dr. Needleman, the important thing now is to conduct studies of people in the general population at high risk of cancers of the colon, bladder, skin or esophagus. But he and Dr. Hawk of the cancer institute say they have one big concern: people will refuse to enter trials because they will want to start taking cox-2 inhibitors. ''It doesn't do anybody any good if they're overzealous,'' Dr. Needleman said. Dr. Hawk agreed. ''We feel it's important to get answers by science, not by personal opinion,'' he said.
But others say that while the memory cells may be a source of the virus, they cannot be the whole story of the H.I.V. reservoir. Dr. Malcolm Martin, the chief of the laboratory of molecular microbiology at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, began questioning the hypothesis when he looked at monkeys infected with a potent form of an AIDS virus. Within a month, the virus destroys every T-cell in the animal's body. Six months later, the animals die. ''A light bulb went off,'' Dr. Martin said. Every T-cell was gone. But the virus was coming from somewhere because the monkeys' blood contained as many as 10 million viruses in every drop. Where, then, are they coming from? he asked. He finds the virus in another class of immune system cells, the macrophages, which protect the body by engulfing and consuming bacteria, dying cells, cancer cells and cells that are infected with microorganisms.
People with the altered genes might also have echocardiograms every year or two to see if their hearts are enlarging, a first sign of possible heart failure. Dr. Liggett said he had not even told the patients in his study whether they had the genes. He is waiting for confirmation from a second study and would need the approval of his medical center's ethics board.
A furor has been growing in Europe for weeks over contentions that some allied troops contracted leukemia from exposure to depleted uranium used in NATO ammunition in the Balkans, and that civilians were put at risk by military testing. But physicists and medical experts say it is biologically impossible for depleted uranium to have caused the leukemia, and they doubt that the metal caused any illnesses in Europe. If the uranium was causing leukemia, it would presumably do so by emitting radioactive particles that would damage the bone marrow. But Dr. Frank von Hippel, a physicist who is a professor of public and international affairs at Princeton University, said depleted uranium was not much of a radioactivity hazard. It is what its name implies -- depleted. It is what is left when the more highly radioactive uranium 235 has been removed from its more abundant atomic cousin, uranium 238. Uranium 235 is used to fuel nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. But uranium 238 ''is very weakly radioactive,'' Dr. von Hippel said.
Some experts have taken issue with Dr. Gotzsche and Mr. Olsen's analysis. But today, the P.D.Q. board said it believed that the scientists had found serious problems. The board's assessment of mammography is expected to be posted on the cancer institute's Web site in April. The P.D.Q. board said it would like to see others take on a detailed and independent analysis of the mammography studies and that some of the data that might settle questions about the quality of the studies could be obtained with difficulty. Some may be in medical records of women in a United States study decades ago. Others are held by Swedish scientists who, the board and others said, have refused to divulge them. The issue of whether women should have mammograms has been controversial for some time. In January 1997, when an independent panel convened by the National Institutes of Health took on the question of mammograms for women in their 40's, Congress got involved. That panel said then that there was no evidence that the test prevented breast cancer deaths in women under 50 and suggested that those women discuss mammograms with their doctors before deciding to have one.
MY father is not an optimistic person, but he certainly had a rosy view of the life expectancies in his family. Everyone, he always said, lived into their late 80's or even their late 90's, and died, not of a specific disease, but of ''old age.'' My mother said her family was equally long- lived. Naturally, my sisters and I grew up thinking that we were genetically blessed. Then one day it hit me. My parents were eliminating a few close relatives from their  data set. What about my father's brother who died when he was in his early 20's after a botched tonsillectomy? Or the brother who died of trauma while he was still a young man? How about my mother's mother, who died of asthma as a young woman? They did not count, my father said, since today their deaths would not have occurred. What about my aunt who had multiple medical problems? She smoked and did not take care of herself, my mother explained.
Overdiagnosis may also be occurring with screening for breast, cervical and ovarian cancers. ''Overdiagnosis exists in virtually every cancer,'' said Dr. Otis Brawley, a professor of medical oncology and epidemiology at the Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University in Atlanta. Unless it can be proved that a screening test reduces the death rate of a cancer, researchers like Dr. Brawley, Dr. Kramer and others say, it may be better to forgo it and wait for symptoms than to have a test. ''It's the iceberg issue,'' Dr. Kramer said. ''If you dip below the waterline to lesions you've never seen before, you can't assume that because they look like tumors we've seen before that they will have the same natural history.'' Dr. Kramer cites data from Japan on a new test to find early lung cancers. The test, spiral C.T. scanning, is finding similar numbers of cancers in people who never smoked as in smokers. Yet 10 times as many smokers die from lung cancer. That, Dr. Kramer said, is a hint that the new test, like the older ones, is finding cancers that are not dangerous.
One solution would be to greatly increase Medicare's budget. But that would mean tax increases. Another would be for Medicare to consider cost-effectiveness, rather than just effectiveness. But, Dr. Tunis said, every time that has been proposed, the agency has had to back down. ''This is the fundamental problem hidden behind the broader discussions of health care reform,'' Dr. Tunis said. ''At the end of the day, somebody has to make the decisions one at a time about what people are going to get. But the reality is that we can't afford to pay for absolutely everything that provides some benefit.'' So, Dr. Garber said, ''Medicare is in a bind.'' ''The real question,'' he said, is ''how can we inform the public better that, when they want to have access to health care, someone will pay and it will be them?''
In the letters they received, participants in the Women's Health Initiative were urged to stay in the study. The study, they were told, ''is more important than ever.'' So far, said Dr. Rossouw, the women are reacting calmly. In the meantime, said Dr. Michael Criqui, an investigator in the study who is a professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of California at San Diego, ''one cannot recommend to a woman to take estrogen to prevent heart disease at this time.'' So far, he said, ''there's no evidence that it will.''
SYMPTOMS -- The symptoms of a heart attack may not be what you think. The most common is chest pain or discomfort. But warning signs also include pain or discomfort elsewhere in the upper body, including the arms, back, neck or stomach. Women in particular may experience shortness of breath, exhaustion, nausea or vomiting, and back or jaw pain. If you have these symptoms, call an ambulance right away. Prompt treatment can open blocked coronary arteries, preventing areas of heart muscle from dying for lack of blood. PLANS -- If you are at high risk, develop a heart attack action plan in consultation with your doctor. That means knowing the warning signs of a heart attack and taking a nitroglycerin, a drug that widens blood vessels, if you have heart attack symptoms. If they don't go away in five minutes, take a second and third nitroglycerin. Have a list of your medicines ready for emergency personnel. And plan ahead with your doctor on how to get to a hospital that can provide emergency heart attack care, including angioplasty, a procedure in which a cardiologist opens a blocked artery with a tiny balloon and then, usually, inserts a stent, a tiny metal cage, to keep it open. Many hospitals do not offer this procedure to heart attack patients, but, if at all possible, you need to go to one that does. If your symptoms stop completely in less than 5 minutes, you should still call your health care provider.
''The next thing you know they will call cancer patients heroes,'' Dr. Gallo said. ''If you had your appendix out, are you an appendix survivor, or if you have arthritis, are you are an arthritis survivor?'' On the other hand, there is no term that people agree would be better. And cancer researchers say the word survivor suits their needs. For studying the changes in the number of people who have received a cancer diagnosis and are still alive, it makes sense to call them survivors, said Dr. Donald Berry, a statistician at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. ''That's the statistician in me, I suppose,'' Dr. Berry said. ''We do analyses of survivors and we start from the get-go.'' Dr. Mullan, who is now a professor of pediatrics and public health at George Washington University and an editor of the journal Health Affairs, said he could think of no better way to describe himself than as a cancer survivor.
Ms. Buchanan said that sort of care made all the difference for her. After learning she had cancer, she decided to have both breasts removed. She had a strong family history of breast cancer and was terrified that she might get cancer in her other breast. And she decided to have breast reconstruction at the same time as her mastectomies. Dr. Dultz and Dr. Marc Alan Drimmer, a Princeton plastic surgeon, did the operation. ''When I woke up after the surgery, she was holding my left hand and he was holding my right hand,'' Ms. Buchanan said. ''When I think about it, it makes me want to cry.''
The company's work will be data analysis, a task that will require an investment of $20 million to $40 million, Dr. Ledley said. The Framingham study began before computers were invented, and its records have been kept in 160 different databases. Laboratory tests, graphs and images must be put into computers and analyzed. ''We have half a million X-rays and EKG's,'' Dr. Ledley said. Then there is the genetic information. Since the 1980's, the study participants have given permission for genetic studies, providing blood samples that have allowed researchers to extract the DNA and store it. Dr. Ledley said he expected to look at 50,000 different genetic landmarks on the participants' DNA. In the meantime, the company, seeking to protect the participants, is proposing the creation of an ethics panel to advise them, Dr. Ledley said. The company has asked Dr. Arthur Caplan, bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, to head it.
Other common medical conditions have not been systematically studied, but Dr. Lindenauer said he would not be surprised if the same held true -- community hospitals will be at least as good as major medical centers for ordinary illnesses. ''A colleague of mine drew an analogy to driving and the idea that you just need to be a good enough driver to avoid accidents,'' he said. Beyond that, he said, ''we don't really differentiate that much between great and good enough.'' The situation is different for more-complex matters like heart surgery and cancer care, researchers say. In such cases, where you go can matter -- a lot, depending on the condition. ''Not that I want to oversimplify to this degree, but for cardiovascular care, pick a very busy, high-volume surgeon,'' said Dr. John D. Birkmeyer, a professor of surgery at the University of Michigan who has analyzed Medicare data. ''For cancer care, focus on the hospital.''
He blames, in part, the hurried day of the busy doctor for the disparity. Many patients balk at taking a drug, and doctors often let it go. Dr. Fonarow adds that patients often feel that taking a drug is an admission of failure. They think they should be able to get their cholesterol levels down with diet and exercise and weight loss. Many are unable to do it, and even if they did, many would never get their L.D.L. below 100 without a drug. Dr. Scott Grundy of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, a member of the expert committee that wrote the guidelines, said the group had debated at great length whether to recommend trying a diet before starting drugs. The members knew that the drugs were expensive, about $100 a month for those without prescription drug plans, and that weight loss could provide other benefits, like reducing blood pressure and improving diabetes. They did not want to abandon dieting, he said, but they knew that many patients had trouble complying and that diets often did not reduce cholesterol enough.
Some -- like Dr. Richard Rawlins, who directs the in-vitro fertilization laboratory for the Rush Health System in Chicago -- say it is only a matter of time before someone announces that a human has been cloned. ''In my opinion,'' he said, ''all it takes right now is time, money and talent.'' The only question is who will do it first, he added. It may be the two fertility experts who recently announced that they wanted to clone a human, Dr. Panayiotis Zavos of the Andrology Institute in Lexington, Ky., and Dr. Severino Antinori, a fertility doctor in Rome. Or it may be a relative unknown. Academic scientists say they would not dare to think of cloning a human at this time. The very experiment would be so controversial that they would become scientific pariahs, said Dr. Alan H. DeCherney, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California in Los Angeles. ''You'd ruin your career,'' he said.
For now, said Dr. Lichtenfeld, of the American Cancer Society, the question will be whether the old P.S.A. cutoff point of 4 should be moved down. ''There's obviously intense discussion,'' he said. ''We may move it down, but we have to weigh the risks and benefits. We will find more prostate cancer, and we will find more cancers that didn't need to be found. We will cause some men harm that they didn't need to have.'' Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine for the Department of Veterans Affairs and at Dartmouth, said the new study should make men reconsider whether they want a P.S.A. test at all. ''The study begins to highlight that we really don't know what we're looking at,'' Dr. Welch said. ''There's a disconnect between the word 'cancer' as most of the public understands it -- a very aggressive disease that leads to death if not treated -- and the way the pathologist understands it, as a few cells that may not be relevant.''
''I think it is really simplistic to make one hormone the heart of it all,'' she said, adding, ''I would think it is a cocktail of goodies and that it probably is a delicate mix.''
The problem with that experiment, Dr. Anderson said, was that researchers needed to get the new genes into stem cells, which are progenitor cells of the immune system.  But scientists at that time faced a conundrum. If they tried to put genes into stem cells that were not dividing, the cells would not accept the genes. If they allowed the cells to divide, they would accept the genes. But, Dr. Anderson said, the cells would mature and would not be stem cells anymore. In the past few years, this obstacle has been overcome. Dr. Fischer said it was that advance, along with numerous technical achievements in molecular biology, that enabled him to successfully treat babies with SCID-X1. ''There is nothing new intellectually here,'' said Dr. Stuart Orkin, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. ''They've put together all the incremental advances that occurred over the past several years.'' But many gene therapy researchers had not waited for such advances, experts said. Starting a decade ago, scientists attempted gene therapy after gene therapy in patients, trying to cure at least a dozen diseases, including cystic fibrosis, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, hemophilia, hypercholesterolemia and -- in more than two-thirds of the studies -- cancer.
But now, with the new study data, medical experts say it has become clear that the exceptions are the cancers that kill. The vast majority of neuroblastomas are harmless, and almost none of these would ever have been found were it not for the screenings. ''From the bottom of my heart as an oncologist, I would have thought at the time that it should work,'' Dr. Schilling said in a telephone interview. But, he said, he is very glad that doctors in Germany did not heed calls from parents whose children had died of neuroblastoma and who had wanted the country to start a national screening program immediately. Dr. Russell Harris, an associate professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina and the co-director of the program on prevention there, said that the neuroblastoma story was perhaps the clearest example of the hazards of screening. But, Dr. Harris said, the same issues arise in all screenings, yet most such tests, including a blood test for prostate cancer and new tests for lung cancer, are being used before they have been evaluated.
Dr. Califf and others cited bed sores as an example. The nation spends billions of dollars a year on special bandages and beds and treatments. ''None of these is proven,'' Dr. Califf said. ''But if you are making a ton of money being reimbursed by Medicare, the last thing you want to do is put your treatment to a test.'' So, at Medicare, administrators decided to focus on just a few treatments at first, for a few common diseases -- pneumonia, heart attacks and heart failure -- where there was little controversy about whether those treatments worked and an abundance of data showing that doctors and hospitals often did not provide them. ''We made an initial decision, which was very political,'' said Dr. Stephen Jencks, Medicare's director of quality coordination. ''We were going after things where there was complete agreement that a service was not being provided.'' They are only a start. ''Almost everyone would agree they are a very narrow slice of the health care pie.''
In the general population, 2.5 percent of the babies delivered at term had weights that low. Weights less than 5 pounds 8 ounces have been associated with medical and developmental problems, including respiratory distress and breathing problems at delivery and learning disabilities later. The investigators said the effect was not caused by the older ages of women who had fertility treatments or any other obvious difference between the groups. The reasons for the effect ''remain unclear and warrant further research,'' the team wrote. ''We think more study is needed.'' the lead author, Dr. Laura A. Schieve, said. But, Dr. Schieve added, with just data from registries to go by, ''our information is limited.'' In a second study, investigators in Australia looked at the incidence of birth defects in babies conceived by one of two fertility treatments, in vitro fertilization, in which sperm and egg are mixed in a petri dish in a laboratory, and intracytoplasmic sperm injection, in which an egg is fertilized in the laboratory by injecting it directly with sperm.
Well, first of all, patients can try to create a more permissive environment where they tell the doctor: ''It's O.K. Tell me what you think is going to happen.'' Or -- and this is a pathetic commentary -- certain doctors are more willing and able to provide information to families. So patients can try the indirect approach and have their families ask. But I feel bad recommending these things because I don't think we should be that way. In some of our research we've shown that the better the doctor knows the patient, the less accurate the prognosis. And we've also shown there is a slight tendency for more experienced physicians to be better prognosticators. This suggests that patients might seek a second opinion in prognoses just as they do in diagnoses and treatment and that experienced and disinterested physicians might be particularly good sources of these second opinions on prognoses.
''She reduced what she ate by 80 to 90 percent,'' Dr. O'Rahilly said. ''Within a week of leptin treatment she was eating normal kid's food.'' But the question is, what does the effect of leptin on the handful of children who lack it entirely say about its effects on most obese people, who seem to make it in abundance? Dr. Flier, of Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center, proposes that leptin is not a signal to lose weight, as originally thought, but a way for the brain to know that there is fat on the body. Children who do not make leptin would have no such signals; their brains would think they had no fat and would spur them to eat more and more in a futile effort to get the leptin signal that fat was present. Dr. Flier reasoned that leptin levels should go down if animals or people were starved. In mice, and now in people, he and others found that leptin levels did drop with starvation. At the same time, subjects become infertile and their thyroid hormone levels sink, slowing the metabolic rate. But Dr. Flier found that if he gave mice leptin while he starved them, their brains never knew they were being starved; the animals remained fertile and their metabolisms did not slow.
''One year someone adds a personality profile, the next year someone adds something else,'' Mr. Jaeger says. ''If one of your competitors adds a service, you add a service.'' Supplying donors who will be saleable is quite a burden for the banks, which say they accept only about 1 to 2 percent of donor applicants. Often a man's sperm is not good enough, reproductively, or his medical history is problematic. Others are now rejected because their looks or education or even their demeanor is wrong. ''We're somewhat in the position of someone who is arranging a blind date,'' says Dr. Charles Sims, medical director and a founder of California Cryobank. So who is Mr. Right for today's woman? He can't be fat. ''We look for a height-weight ratio that is within the norm,'' Dr. Sims explains. Being short is negotiable. ''If you have a 5-foot-7 or -8 donor who is a medical student or Ph.D. scientist, that outweighs the height issue in many situations,'' Dr. Sims says.
But a new economic approach to health care expenditures views costs in a very different light. Economists agree that huge increases are coming. But some say that may be just fine. By 2030, predicts Robert W. Fogel, a Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, about 25 percent of the G.D.P. will be spent on health care, making it ''the driving force in the economy,'' just as railroads drove the economy at the start of the 20th century. Unless the current system is changed, most health care costs will continue to be paid by insurance, especially Medicare, which means that the taxpayers will foot the bill. But Dr. Fogel says he is not alarmed. Americans can afford it, he says, because the nation is so rich. ''It takes so little of household income to satisfy expenditures on food, clothing and shelter,'' he explains. ''At the end of the 19th century, food, clothing and shelter accounted for 80 percent of the family budget. Today it's about a third.''
But every scientist, even those whose work is only peripherally related to therapeutic cloning, hears from desperate patients who do not want to hear about the obstacles. Like Christopher Reeve, the paralyzed actor who has urged scientists to experiment on his cells, they do not want to wait. ''Anything they think compromises therapy, they are angry about,'' Dr. Gearhart said. ''It is sometimes very difficult with patients to get across to them this need for basic science, for fundamental discoveries, to enable us to derive appropriate therapies. They don't have much time left.'' Even scientists whose work is far removed from stem cells say they regularly hear from patients. ''I try to reply to every one,'' Dr. Goldstein said. But he agonizes over what to say. ''The goal is to engender hope but not promise what you can't deliver. Sometimes the brutal honesty of science is not what you want to be facing these people with.''
''No one in my family has ever had breast cancer,'' Ms. Richardson said. ''Is it quality of life or quantity of life? Truthfully, if my destiny is to feel great now and maybe shorten my future, I'd rather feel well now.''
The results, being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, showed that those who ate the high-fiber diets were no less likely to develop new polyps over the next few years than those who did not. ''These are pretty stunning articles,'' Dr. Omenn said. Dr. Kramer said it remained possible that a high-fiber diet could alter colon cancer risk: the effect might occur either before polyps develop or very late in the development of colon cancer, outside the period covered by the studies. But that is only a hypothesis, he said. And Dr. David Hunter, director of the Harvard Center for Cancer Prevention, said that although ''there is no reason to think there is any harm associated with cereal fiber,'' it appears that ''it's not going to prevent colon polyps or cancer, at least in the short term or over a decade.'' The hypothesis linking fiber to a reduced risk of colon cancer dates from 1971, with a paper by Dr. Denis P. Burkitt, a British missionary surgeon who noticed that poor rural Africans had much less colon cancer than affluent Westerners. The reason, Dr. Burkitt proposed, was diet:  the Africans ate much more fiber. Over the years, evidence supporting the hypothesis steadily mounted.
Before the week was over, the panel's chairman, Dr. Leon Gordis of the Johns Hopkins University, had been summoned by Senator Arlen Specter to testify before Congress. Later, going against the conclusions of the panel convened at its behest, the cancer institute said women in their 40's should have mammograms. The P.D.Q. board, which issues its statements independently, has also said over the last several years that mammograms prevent breast cancer deaths for women in their 40's. Today, the P.D.Q. board emphasized that mammograms have drawbacks, leading at times to excessive treatments for tumors that would not have threatened a woman's life. The group agreed that doctors should respect a woman's decision, adding that it was rational to decide to have mammograms and that it was rational to decide not to. Whatever they decided, Dr. Berry said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that he was acutely aware of the difficulty in questioning an enormous mammography business.
Not everyone would agree. At Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York, which offers diet and nutrition counseling and even cooking classes, cancer screening, genetic counseling and, of course, smoking cessation programs, the feeling is that there are great opportunities. ''There is a lot that can be done to prevent cancer and detect it early,'' said Dr. Shike, director of the cancer prevention and wellness program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. ''My feeling is that the general public and the medical profession don't take advantage of all the things we can do.'' That depends on how you view the evidence and on what you mean by prevention, said Dr. Barnett Kramer, director of the office of disease prevention at the National Cancer Institute. One potential source of confusion, he said, is that cancer prevention centers include screening. But screening, with a few exceptions like colon cancer and cervical screening that find and remove precancerous growths, looks for cancer that is already present. That may or may not save lives, Dr. Kramer said, depending on whether the treatment is effective and whether the cancer would have been deadly if it had been left alone, undetected.
The term can come as a rude surprise. Cancer survivor. How can it be that the moment you receive a diagnosis you get that tag? What if you only live for a day, or even just a few hours? That's being a survivor? The phrase, and its definition, first entered the lexicon nearly two decades ago, in a wrenching essay in the New England Journal of Medicine. Its author, Dr. Fitzhugh Mullan, spoke of his own cancer, a mediastinal seminoma, and what it was like for cancer patients to pass through what he called ''the seasons of survival.'' ''Survival, in fact, begins at the point of diagnosis because that is the time when cancer patients are forced to confront their own mortality,'' Dr. Mullan wrote. In 1987, Dr. Mullan helped found an advocacy group, the National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship, which defined survivors his way, as anyone who has had a cancer diagnosis. The group's current president and chief executive, Ellen Stovall, says that while some like the term, many rail against it.
Dr. Richard Friedman, a psychopharmacologist at Weill Medical College of Cornell University, had a runner's high -- once. ''When I was young and foolish, I ran a marathon in the Smoky Mountains,'' he said. ''I have never before or since had that kind of high, and maybe it was just the result of a near-death experience.'' Bill Fox, a recreational bicyclist and an I.B.M. research lab technician, says his exercise highs do not come easily. ''You've really got to work for this high,'' Mr. Fox explained, saying he usually needed two hours or more of sweaty, intense, vigorous exercise. But when the feeling comes, he said, it is just like cocaine, a drug he knows from his days as an addict. ''It has that well-being kind of feeling, that Superman kind of feeling,'' said Mr. Fox of Middletown, N.Y. Others say they never get such a feeling, no matter how hard or how much they exercise. In fact, despite a widespread belief in the so-called runner's high, a feeling of intense euphoria that is supposed to come with vigorous exercise, the experience is not consistent or predictable. Some researchers have asked whether it exists at all.
In their new work, the South Korean researchers produced stem cells that were exact matches for 9 of 11 patients, including 8 adults with spinal cord injuries and 3 children -- a 10-year-old boy with a spinal cord injury, a 6-year-old girl with diabetes and a 2-year-old boy with congenital hypogammaglobulinemia, a genetic disorder of the immune system. Dr. Zon cautioned that ''it will take a lot of work'' before stem cells fulfill their promises in medicine, but he said the new finding would bring scientists significantly closer to the goals. Dr. Hwang said he had been flooded by requests from researchers who wanted to visit and study his methods, including Dr. Ian Wilmut, the researcher in Scotland who created the first cloned mammal, a sheep named Dolly, in 1996, astonishing scientists who had thought cloning was biologically impossible. Dr. Wilmut visited the laboratory in Seoul, and this week Dr. Hwang went to Dr. Wilmut's laboratory at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh to help him in his quest to produce human embryos by cloning and to extract their stem cells.
A 1972 law prohibited the Defense Department from engaging in any clinical research unless the subjects or their next of kin gave explicit informed consent in advance. That ruled out most trauma research: the patients were generally unconscious, and their next of kin were usually unavailable. The same problem had plagued civilian trauma research until 1996, when the federal regulations applying to research by nonmilitary doctors was changed to allow so-called community consent. Under the new rules, researchers can get a blanket consent from communities, automatically enrolling patients who are unable to sign consent forms or have relatives who cannot be found in time. The researchers must advertise the study and explain it at meetings. But military research was not included. ''When I think about all the things the military has contributed, yellow fever vaccine, Medevac, I said, 'This doesn't make sense,' '' Colonel Keenan said. With the support of Senator Hutchison, she began drafting legislation, and soon trauma surgeons were sending letters supporting it.
Yet, Dr. Faden said, ''many physician investigators feel uncomfortable with the idea of using patients in studies and then not being able to continue to help them when the trial ends.'' ''We seem to hit a wall of moral unease,'' she said. ''In the end, I'm not sure exactly where we ought to end up.'' Companies must make business decisions about where to market their drugs, figuring out whether they can earn enough money to justify applying for approval, setting up business offices and hiring a sales force. If they decide not to market a drug in a given country, they are unlikely to provide it to patients there free of charge. To provide a drug for what medical professionals call compassionate use, companies must set up a distribution system, train doctors to administer the drugs, monitor patients for adverse effects and track the results. Whether to undertake a compassionate-use program for drugs that improve the quality of life but do not prolong it -- ranolazine, the drug CV Therapeutics has developed, is one example -- poses ''a delicate question,'' said Tony Plohoros, a spokesman for Merck, a company that has systems to distribute lifesaving drugs in poor countries where there is a need.
Other women want to stop taking the hormones, but worry about how they can tolerate the severe symptoms of menopause that the hormones have squelched. About two-thirds of women have symptoms at menopause. Of that total, about a third have them severely, with at least five to seven disabling hot flashes a day, said Dr. Wulf Utian, the executive director of the North American Menopause Society. Their symptoms last from about a year to many years, he said, adding that he had a few patients in their 60's and 70's who had not taken hormones for their symptoms and were continuing to have hot flashes. ''We just don't understand at all why some women's symptoms go on and on,'' Dr. Utian said. There is also no way to predict when a woman's symptoms will end, Dr. Grady of the University of California said. When a woman starts having symptoms like flushes and sweating, she said, ''we have no way of estimating if they will last three months or two years.''
Donald Kirkendall, an exercise physiologist at the University of North Carolina, will never forget the time he put a heart-rate monitor on a member of the United States rowing team and asked the man to row as hard as he could for six minutes. The standard formula for calculating how fast a human heart can beat calls for subtracting the person's age from 220. The rower was in his mid-20's. Just getting the heart to its actual maximum rate is an immense effort and holding it there for even a minute is so painful that it is all but inconceivable for anyone who is not supremely motivated, Dr. Kirkendall said. But this rower confounded the predictions. ''His pulse rate hit 200 at 90 seconds into the test,'' Dr. Kirkendall said. ''And he held it there for the rest of the test.'' A local cardiologist was looking on in astonishment and told Dr. Kirkendall, ''You know, there's not a textbook in the world that says a person could have done that.''
''We know we can extend the life span of mammals,'' said Dr. Judith Campisi, who heads the department of cellular and molecular biology at the Berkeley National Laboratory. ''There is no reason to believe that we couldn't do the same today in humans.'' Dr. Cynthia Kenyon, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics at the University of California at San Francisco, concurred. ''It is probably possible,'' she said. ''The lights are green everywhere you go.'' Moreover, if their expectations bear fruit, the scientists said, these latter-day Methuselahs will not creak along, riddled with disabilities and disease, for decade after decade. The goal is to allow people to be vigorous and healthy as they age, to stretch out the good years rather than elongate the bad ones. It is, said Dr. Kenyon, 45, as if someone who looks as she does were actually 90. Just imagine it, ''I'm 90,'' she said, challenging  the scientists as they turned to stare at her, a tall, vibrant, honey-blond professor.
Different investigators, stumbling upon various stages of the small clumps independently, gave them different names. They say they struggled for years to persuade colleagues to pay attention. Dr. William L. Klein, a professor of neurobiology and physiology in the Alzheimer's Disease Core Center at Northwestern University, called them A.D.D.L.'s, for amyloid derived diffusible ligands, and reported that they blocked communication between nerve cells. But, he said, when he first presented his data at a meeting in 1998, the audience of scientists was skeptical. ''I overheard some folks saying, 'How could that be? Why didn't we see it?' '' In the meantime, Dr. Dennis J. Selkoe of Harvard was finding essentially the same thing -- chains of molecules, which he called protofibrils, that disrupted nerve cell communication. The chains consisted of about 100 molecules of amyloid beta protein, compared with thousands in that make up plaque in a fibril. Dr. Selkoe added the small clumps of molecules to nerve cells in the laboratory. ''They killed them,'' he said, but the cells died more slowly than they did when they were mixed with larger clumps that make plaques. Then, Dr. Selkoe said, he injected protofibrils into rats and found that they interfered with the first steps of memory and learning.
Dr. Kawaoka explained that bird flu viruses sometimes acquire changes in a protein, hemagglutinin, that the virus needs to burst into cells and infect them. The change allows the virus to grow outside the lungs and the intestines, where bird flu viruses are usually contained,  and turns the virus lethal for birds. The Hong Kong virus infecting and killing chickens had acquired that hemagglutinin change. But, Dr. Kawaoka asked, why were strains of that virus, unlike most bird viruses, also able to grow so well in people? Using new methods of synthesizing live flu viruses in the laboratory, Dr. Kawaoka and his colleagues meticulously went through the Hong Kong virus's eight gene segments, switching a gene from a lethal strain with its counterpart in a nonlethal strain, and asking if the change made the new virus nonlethal to mice. They repeated the procedure  with different genes. They also did the reverse, starting with a nonlethal strain and replacing individual genes with counterparts from a lethal strain.
Dr. Valavanur A. Subramanian, chairman of the department of cardiac surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, said the pump could injure the brain in several ways. ''It may be blood flow changes,'' Dr. Subramanian said, ''or people with higher risk may have atherosclerosis in their aorta, and the debris may go to their head. Or the pump may generate microemboli,'' tiny clots, air bubbles or clumps of cells in blood. Animal studies indicated that heart-lung machines seemed to be showering debris and tiny gas bubbles into the brain, said Dr. John D. Puskas, a heart surgeon at Crawford Long Hospital at Emory University in Atlanta. ''It was compelling,'' Dr. Puskas said. ''We've been doing cardiac surgery for more than 300,000 Americans a year, and most of those people have done extremely well.'' Off-pump surgery was difficult, especially at first. One problem was simply holding a part of the beating heart still to work on it.
The 1918 influenza virus, the cause of one of history's most deadly epidemics, has been reconstructed and found to be a bird flu that jumped directly to humans, two teams of federal and university scientists announced yesterday. It was the culmination of work that began a decade ago and involved fishing tiny fragments of the 1918 virus from snippets of lung tissue from two soldiers and an Alaskan woman who died in the 1918 pandemic. The soldiers' tissue had been saved in an Army pathology warehouse, and the woman had been buried in permanently frozen ground. ''This is huge, huge, huge,'' said John Oxford, a professor of virology at St. Bartholomew's and the Royal London Hospital who was not part of the research team. ''It's a huge breakthrough to be able to put a searchlight on a virus that killed 50 million people. I can't think of anything bigger that's happened in virology for many years.''
In their study, Dr. Wadden and Dr. Tsai also looked at programs, like Optifast, Health Management Resources and Medifast, that provide participants with medical supervision and a very low-calorie diet -- 800 to to 1500 calories per day. Patients who stay with these programs, the companies say, can lose as much as 15 to 25 percent of their weight in three to six months. But the researchers found no randomized controlled trials of their effectiveness. And the studies that were conducted independently of the companies showed that people on the very low-calorie diets weighed about the same a year later as people on conventional diets. In addition, the companies' own reports found high dropout rates, with nearly half the participants in an Optifast study dropping out in 26 weeks. But Dr. Larry Stifler, the founder and president of Health Management Resources, objected. ''Their criteria -- one of the things they always like to see -- is randomized controlled trials,'' Dr. Stifler said. But such studies, he said, are not feasible when a company is offering a treatment.
Others disagreed, often forcefully. ''The kind of policies one would develop for something that is killing about as many people as tobacco or a quarter as many people as tobacco are very different,'' said Dr. Stanton A. Glantz, professor of medicine and director of the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of California, San Francisco. Dr. Glantz estimates that the number of deaths from obesity to be more like 100,000 than 400,000. And the inflated numbers of obesity deaths, he added, represent '' a very, very fundamental mistake that was made in the paper, which they have done nothing to address.'' ''This is not some esoteric little detail over which there is huge uncertainty,'' he said. Others, who are not part of the antitobacco movement, agreed with Dr. Glantz that the 400,000 figure made little sense. Dr. Oliver, for example, said obesity, like tobacco, had little effect on mortality in people over 65. So with two million deaths a year in the United States, 70 percent of which are among people over 65, virtually every younger person who dies would have to die from obesity. ''The numbers simply don't add up,'' he said.
For four years, Richard Arvedon has been a passionate advocate for therapeutic cloning. The reason is his 6-year-old daughter, Emma. She has diabetes and is likely to develop serious complications within a decade, he said. Mr. Arvedon's hope is that scientists will take Emma's cells, start the cloning process by making embryos that are genetically identical to her, extract stem cells and grow them into healthy pancreas cells that will not be rejected by her body. ''I don't see anything else on the horizon that could help Emma in time,'' said Mr. Arvedon, a lawyer in Hartford. But scientists say that crusading patient advocates like Mr. Arvedon are desperate for a cure that they cannot provide. They are encouraged by the announcement last week that South Korean scientists had developed a line of cloned human embryonic stem cells, the universal cells that in theory can turn into any of the body's cells or tissues. In the face of powerful opposition to cloning of any kind from religious and political groups, including members of the Bush administration and Congress, these scientists say they desperately need friends like Mr. Arvedon.
But isn't it true that we can decide to eat or not, choosing to skip dinner, say, or pass up dessert? Isn't that free will? Not really, Dr. Friedman said. The control mechanisms for body weight operate over months, even years, not day to day or meal to meal. ''People live in the moment,'' he said. ''They lose weight over the short term and say that they have exercised willpower,'' but over the long term, the body's intrinsic controls win out. And just as willpower cannot make fat people thin, a lack of it does not make thin people fat. No one, he says, can consciously calibrate their food intake as precisely as the body does naturally. Most people's weights remain steady, within about 10 pounds, year in and year out. But when people count calories, they typically err by about 10 percent. For someone who eats 750,000 calories in a year, that 10 percent error would add up to 75,000 calories, or about 25 pounds.
''Suppose you put in an extra glutamate receptor and turn it on before giving a test to a monkey,'' Dr. Verma said. He said it would be interesting to know whether the monkeys' memories improved. What if it worked and then humans wanted that gene? ''If something can be done, people will do it,'' Dr. Verma replied, though he added that he was comforted by the thought that there would be very few people who could afford such genetic engineering, and even fewer who would want it. The current study being published today in the journal Molecular Human Reproduction, is more of a demonstration of feasibility, experts said. To add genes to monkey embryos, Dr. Gerald Schatten of the Oregon Primate Research Center at Oregon Health Sciences University in Beaverton, and his colleagues began by mixing jellyfish genes with sperm cells from rhesus monkeys. The genes stuck naturally to the outside of the sperm cells.
In the second paper, by Dr. Jeffrey M. Friedman, a Howard Hughes medical investigator at Rockefeller University, he and his colleagues examined two brain pathways in adult mice -- one that increases appetite and another that decreases it. By examining the actual nerves in slices of brain, they said, they saw that mice that make no leptin have strong brain circuits that signal them to eat. They have correspondingly weak circuits that signal them to stop eating. Then they gave the animals leptin. Within six hours, their brain circuits were like those in normal animals, the researchers said. Two days after being treated with leptin, the mice lost their huge appetites. The researchers also tested another hormone, ghrelin, whose effects are the opposite of leptin's, giving it to normal mice. Four days later, the animals were eating more and their brains were rewired in the opposite direction, the researchers said. Dr. Friedman said he was taken aback.
He and others hope that professional medical societies can set guidelines for appropriate use, and insurers can enforce them. Dr. Nissen wants guidelines, too. ''I am vice president of the American College of Cardiology and in 2006 I will be president,'' he said. ''I will press for an appropriateness standard,'' to guide the use of the scans. Such guidelines have not stopped overuse in the past, he acknowledged. And, in this case, he said, ''I am afraid the genie is already out of the bottle.''
The disease, if it is a disease, afflicts most middle-aged and elderly women, and a large segment of men. But it has no symptoms, it is not clear what patients should do about it and it is being diagnosed more and more often. The condition is osteopenia, or low bone density. It is considered by many doctors to be a first step along the path to osteoporosis, a serious condition in which bone density is extremely low and bones are porous and prone to shatter. But researchers say that while bone density predicts fracture risk, more is involved, including age, family history and a poorly understood factor known as bone quality. Those nuances may be lost, researchers say, as patients fixate on a number -- bone density -- and a diagnosis -- osteopenia -- and fear that unless they take action their fates are sealed. Doctors are telling women to find out their bone density as soon as they go through menopause. Younger women as well as middle-aged men are also getting tested.
Dr. Wurtman, who describes himself as a fat person in a thin person's body, says he is so concerned about getting his aerobic exercise every day that he calls hotels before he visits them when he travels to make sure they have stair-stepping machines. ''There's one hotel in Paris that I've gone to for 15 years because they had the only StairMaster in town,'' he said. He also keeps a mental tally of the calories he consumes each day, aiming for a total of about 2,000. Breakfast is always grapefruit juice, black coffee and a bran muffin made by his wife, Dr. Judith Wurtman, who directs Triad, a commercial weight-loss center in Belmont, Mass. No bakery muffins for the Wurtmans. They can have 600 calories, Dr. Wurtman said. Lunch for Dr. Wurtman is either a cup of soup or nothing at all, unless he has a visitor and goes out to eat. ''Then I compensate later,'' he said, eating less for the rest of the day. After work, Dr. Wurtman has ''a dab of cottage cheese -- we buy the fat-free kind -- and I pour some soy sauce on it to make it taste good.'' Then he goes to the gym. After working out, he and his wife have dinner. ''It's very spartan -- fish and lots of vegetables and good bread.'' For dessert, he gets a treat -- some frozen yogurt.
At issue are practical questions about what it would mean to women's health and well-being if the devices return. What are the likely consequences of having a silicone breast implant? Do women who have them risk poorer health in general? How likely is it that the devices will rupture or that women will have painful scar tissue that forms over the device? How long does an implant last before it has to be replaced? Some have said that Inamed's three-year studies are not long enough to look for adverse effects. The drug agency has not required that other devices, put in patients' bodies, be studied for more than a few years. Should implants be held to a different standard? The panel repeatedly questioned Inamed: What did its tests of the strength of the implant shell mean, in practical terms? If implants can rupture without a woman knowing, should women have M.R.I. scans every year or so to detect them? What about replacing implants? Should women consider having them removed and replaced after, say, 10 years, or should they leave them alone unless and until they cause problems? Is there any explanation for the company's data that women were satisfied, when the company also reported that women who had implants often ended up back in the operating room a year or two later after suffering complications?
Two papers published today on the benefits and risks of mammography come to different conclusions about the breast cancer screening, continuing a debate that has erupted over the past year. One paper, by the United States Preventive Services Task Force, makes recommendations that are generally followed by the nation's primary care doctors and concludes that the pooled data from randomized trials support mammography every one to two years for women ages 40 to 74. The group announced its conclusions at a news conference last winter, but its paper, being published today in The Annals of Internal Medicine, is the first formal publication of its methods, results and conclusions. A second paper in the same issue determines that women in their 40's reap no benefit from mammography and have real risks of harm from unnecessary treatment. It presents the latest results from a study of more than 90,000 Canadian women. Earlier findings from the same study after seven years also found no benefit, but some medical experts predicted that benefits would emerge with time. The new findings show that even 11 to 16 years after the women were enrolled, mammography had not saved any lives and had led to excess treatment.
In response, health organizations, including the American Cancer Society, the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Academy of Family Physicians, took out advertisements saying that mammograms saved lives and that they were concerned that the debate was going to erode women's confidence in the test. In subsequent years, Dr. Harris said, he and others became convinced that mammography could work, in ideal clinical trial settings in studies in Sweden. But he wondered what its effects were in the United States today. ''The question was not whether you could make mammography work under ideal circumstances,'' Dr. Harris said, ''but does it work now, in the real world right now?'' It was a question of particular importance, he said, because treatment was much better than it had been even a decade before and improving day by day. That led him and others to ask whether mammography was making much of a difference in reducing the death toll.
The agency decided to use its influence to speed up research on off-label uses of four new drugs approved for colorectal cancer -- oxaliplatin, irinotecan, bevacizumab and cetusimab. On Monday, Medicare said it would require national contractors to pay for off-label uses of the drugs for patients in any of nine clinical trials being started by the National Cancer Institute. That way, Dr. Tunis said, Medicare hopes to encourage patients to enter the studies, which will determine whether the drugs are effective in the new contexts. CancerCare, a nonprofit group providing support services to cancer patients and their families, was delighted. ''What I most impressed with is to see C.M.S. really focused on this issue of quality and not just as acting as a payer,'' said Diane Blum, the group's director, referring to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. ''It is an enormous step forward and I hope the patient community pays attention.''
Now everything was changed and, Ms. Goodman continued, ''their emotions became much more complex.'' Reading the scene, Dr. Schwarz said: ''I had a tingle in my spine. How did she know?'' The book, he noted, ''also beautifully puts its finger on the ideals of science'' the tension between the need to tell the truth and the need to present research in its most promising light. Dr. Schwarz said he got a dose of this when he was a young Stanford professor in the early 1990's. He wrote a draft of a paper and showed it to a colleague who, Dr. Schwarz recalled, said, ''If you want to send it to Nature, you have to take the hemline up a few inches.'' For Ms. Goodman, the trick was not so much getting the nuances of science right as recognizing what a lab can reveal about jealousy and aspirations and, yes, nobility.
''Subjecting women to a mastectomy because we now have a technique that is sensitive enough to detect microscopic foci is not a step forward,'' Dr. Morrow wrote in her editorial. ''The medical profession needs to ask itself rigorously, Are these cells medically important, or have we proved they can be controlled by radiation?'' she added in a telephone interview. ''I think that the studies prove that radiation is controlling most of them.''
Her lungs would be filling with fluid, she would feel as if she were drowning, and she would have to call her doctor's office and tell the receptionist to leave a note for the nurse. It may take an hour, it may take a day or more for the nurse to call. Then she had to persuade the nurse that she needed to see a doctor. The solutions, which transformed Ms. Bryson's life, are the shared care plan and help from a nurse, a clinical care specialist. Under the shared care plan, doctors and patients and their families have access to the computerized medical records. Patients can note changes in their reactions to medications, for instance, and every doctor can see the updated information. The highly knowledgeable clinical care specialists serve as personal assistants to severely ill patients, going with them to doctors' offices, being available by cellphone to answer questions and teaching them to manage their diseases.
The Department of Veterans Affairs has gone from giving beta blockers to about 60 percent of its heart attack patients to giving them to 98 percent. Sometimes, disclosure of lapses in one area can elicit changes in a hospital's entire system, saving patients' lives across the board. That happened when Duke researchers asked 315 hospitals for data on nine drugs that everyone agrees should be provided to heart attack patients. For example, the hospitals were asked how often their heart attack patients got aspirin when they arrived (that alone can cut the death rate by 23 percent). When they were discharged, did they also get a statin to lower cholesterol levels? Nearly all should, with the exception of patients who have had a bad reaction to a statin and those rare patients with very low cholesterol levels. Did they get a beta blocker? Once hospitals learned their score, it was up to them what to do. Over the next year, ones that improved in these measures saw their patient mortality from all causes fall by 40 percent. Those whose compliance scores did not change had no change in their mortality rate, and those whose performance fell had increases in their mortality rates.
Then, he said, there is the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation. ''That started in 1955,'' Dr. Boice said. ''We meet every year in Vienna and we publish volumes.'' In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements wrestle with the radiation standards question, and the National Academy of Sciences has been called upon periodically since the 1950's to weigh in with its committee, called the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation committee. The Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health conduct extensive research. The science has grown rapidly. In 1980, Dr. Boice set up the radiation epidemiology section at the National Cancer Institute with just a handful of researchers. Now, he said, while he moved on to form the International Epidemiology Institute, which conducts research for industry and the government, the cancer institute's radiation department is no longer a section, it is a branch, and one of the largest branches there, with hundreds of scientists.
At RMA, Ms. Miller, the embryology director, said the vigorous marketing strategy and good results with patients seemed to be paying off. RMA has opened three new medical offices in New Jersey in two years. ''A lot of programs don't have the budget for marketing,'' Ms. Miller said. But, she added, ''It is a large part of our program.''
The new study, reported in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that the device could also help a much larger group of patients, those who have serious damage from heart attacks and are at risk for arrhythmias, but have not had them. About four million patients in the United States fall into this category, with 400,000 added each year. In the new study, the devices reduced the mortality rate among such patients by 30 percent in 20 months. Many heart experts welcomed the finding. But even some who did said it would confront society with medical and ethical questions that few had anticipated. The devices can fundamentally change the end stages of heart disease, giving years of life to people who would otherwise die. Some experts are asking whether the devices are going to create a new generation of patients who die slow and painful deaths. ''Clearly, the defibrillators are a marvelous breakthrough,'' said Dr. Lynn Warner Stevenson, the director of the cardiomyopathy and heart failure program at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ''For patients who are living a good quality of life, the defibrillators can prevent a tragic, premature end to that life. But they are a double-edged sword. As the disease gets worse, the mode of death is not an attractive one. And we are not preparing patients for that.''
For a brief moment, Dr. Thomas Giannulli, a Seattle internist, thought he was getting in at the start of an exciting new area of medicine. He was opening a company to offer CT scans to the public -- no doctor's referral necessary. The scans, he said, could find diseases like cancer or heart disease early, long before there were symptoms. And, for the scan centers, there was money to be made. The demand for the scans -- of the chest, of the abdomen, of the whole body -- was so great that when Dr. Giannulli opened his center in 2001, he could hardly keep up. ''We were very successful; we had waiting lists,'' he said. He was spending $20,000 a month on advertising and still making money. Three years later, the center was down to one or two patients a day and Dr. Giannulli was forgoing a paycheck. Finally, late last year, he gave up and closed the center.
''Measles is even tougher,'' Dr. Robbins said. ''It is highly contagious, and there are other things that cause rashes. And it is not as easy to isolate the virus as it is with smallpox and polio,'' making diagnosis even more difficult. Some say public health officials should simply abandon the ideal of eradicating diseases. Dr. D. A. Henderson, a leader in the smallpox vaccination campaign, called disease eradication ''a siren song.'' So where does that leave SARS? The good news, said Dr. Kathryn V. Holmes, a leading expert on coronaviruses who is a microbiology professor at the University of Colorado in Denver, is that despite speculation that the SARS virus would mutate quickly into new, possibly even more infectious and deadly variants, that is unlikely. Like most viruses, coronaviruses, the viruses in the class that includes the one that causes SARS, tend to die if they mutate. That is why most disease vaccines, like those for polio, measles and smallpox, remain effective year after year. The flu, in which mutated viruses are infectious, is the exception, not the rule.
''We were seduced by the concept,'' said Dr. Erick Laine, Madrona's chief executive. ''But it doesn't work.'' The doctors were expected to purchase electronic medical records systems and to provide services that substituted for individual doctor visits, like e-mailing with patients. The problem, said Dr. David Reuben, chief of the geriatrics division at the University of California, Los Angeles, medical school, is that ''we have a health care financing system where the incentives are totally misaligned.'' ''Let's say you do a really good job of keeping somebody out of the hospital,'' Dr. Reuben said. ''Or let's say you spare someone a physician's visit. You save the system money, but nobody benefits from the savings.'' Or as Dr. Laine said: ''The concern we had was that in a system that requires substantial investment, the benefits that accrue to the system need to accrue back to those making the investment. Unless that happens, the system is not credible and it is not sustainable.''
''There's no question -- it's a big effect,'' said Dr. David Faxon, the president of the American Heart Association. ''It's very significant. It offers hope for a large group of patients who have a very bad outlook. Before, we didn't have a good therapy for them.'' For now, insurers and Medicare pay for limited use of the defibrillators in those patients who already have heart arrhythmias. But use of the device in the wider group is under expedited review at the Food and Drug Administration, according to Dr. Arthur Moss of the University of Rochester Medical Center, who directed the study. The study was paid for by the device's manufacturer, the Guidant Corporation. Dr. Moss said that the investigators insisted on autonomy, that they did not hold stock in the company, nor were they speakers for Guidant. ''What are we going to do when the phones start ringing off the hook?'' asked Dr. Michael Lauer, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation who directs clinical research in the department of cardiovascular medicine there.
''Calling 911 seems like such a project,'' Mr. Orr said. ''I reserve it for car accidents and exploding appliances. I feel like if I can walk and talk and breathe I should just get here.'' It is an understandable response, but one that can be fatal, cardiologists say. ''If you come to the hospital unannounced or if you drive yourself there, you're burning time,'' Dr. Antman said. ''And time is muscle,'' he added, meaning that heart muscle is dying as the minutes tick away. There may be false alarms, Dr. Sopko said. ''But it is better to be checked out and find out it's not a problem than to have a problem and not have the therapy,'' he said. Calling an ambulance promptly is only part of the issue, heart researchers say. There also is the question of how, or even whether, the patient gets either of two types of treatment to open the blocked arteries, known as reperfusion therapy.
At three laboratories here, separated by a taxi ride of no more than 10 or 15 minutes, the world of stem cell research can be captured in all its complexity, promise and diversity. One of the labs focuses on cells taken from human embryos, another on cells from mice and fish, and a third from stem cells that have mysteriously survived in the adult body long after their original mission is over. But while the work here and elsewhere has touched off a debate reaching into the presidential campaign, a tour through these labs shows that the progress of research is both greater and less than it seems from a distance. One idea, the focus of about half the nation's stem cell research, involves studying stem cells that are naturally present in adults. Researchers have found such cells in a variety of tissues and organs and say they seem to be a part of the body's normal repair mechanism. There are no ethical issues in studying these cells, but the problem is in putting them to work to treat diseases. So far, no one has succeeded.
The next red flag is the sheer number of diseases. ''Any time I see half a dozen diseases attributed to some exposure, I get very nervous,'' Dr. Bailar said. Biological agents, he said, ''are very well targeted.'' Vinyl chloride has been shown to cause liver cancer, but not asthma. Asbestos has been shown to cause lung cancer, but not breast cancer or brain cancer. The list of illnesses that any chemical is known to cause is very short, said Dr. Stephen Safe, a toxicologist at Texas A &amp; M University. ''The list is not 10,000 diseases,'' he said. Scientists would also ask if it is even plausible that chromium (VI) in drinking water was making hundreds of people gravely ill. Of course, both sides in the litigation that ensued over the Hinkley groundwater contamination brought in their own scientific experts, although that was not pursued in the movie, but federal agencies whose scientists were not involved in the litigation said evidence was lacking that chromium (VI) in groundwater caused a myriad of health problems. The chemical's main problem, they said, is that it can cause lung cancer if workers inhale it as particulates in large doses for long periods of time.
Dr. Metzger wrote an editorial accompanying a paper on the study, to be published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine. The future of TNX-901 is uncertain. The researchers would like to conduct a larger study and include children as young as 2 or 3 and then seek marketing approval. But they are stalled while the inventor and developer of the drug, Tanox, of Houston, determines with Genentech and Novartis whether the three companies develop TNX-901 together or whether they develop another drug, Xolair, for peanut allergies. Xolair has the same mechanism as TNX-901 and was tested in more than 4,000 patients. But the tests were for asthma, not peanut allergies. The companies say it may be approved as early as July. Some doctors said they would offer it to patients with severe allergies. After a drug is on the market, doctors can prescribe it for other conditions.
Some pediatricians, however, still say that the hypothesis of early puberty rings true to them and that doctors who cling to old notions of when it should begin are harming girls who are normal, but developing at today's early age. ''What's worse?'' asked Dr. Paul B. Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Medical College of Virginia of Virginia Commonwealth University. Puberty starting at age 6 or 7 and perhaps resulting in a menstrual period at age 10? ''Or,'' Dr. Kaplowitz added, ''going through an exhaustive endocrinological work-up and monthly injections at $6,000 to $10,000 a year?'' The issue has now reached the point of an acrid dispute among pediatric endocrinologists, with the experts on each side barely able to speak civilly about their opponents. ''A certain amount of dissent can be refreshing,'' Dr. Kaplowitz said. ''But this is not refreshing.'' The early puberty hypothesis emerged when Dr. Marcia E. Herman-Giddens, working as a physician's assistant in North Carolina, noticed that girls as young as 7 or 8  were coming in with breasts or pubic hair. Dr. Herman-Giddens had a hunch that puberty was starting much earlier than the textbooks said, and proposed a study to investigate.
The problem with weight loss, researchers say, is that the advice so often given, eat less and exercise more, has not been much help. Research studies at academic medical centers, providing intensive diet, exercise and behavioral therapy, result in losses of 8 to 12 percent of body weight in six months. But most people gain the weight back in a few years. As for commercial weight loss programs, in a two-year study sponsored by Weight Watchers involving 358 people averaging 205 pounds, those assigned to the program lost 6.4 pounds. Participants who were randomly assigned to try to lose weight on their own lost nothing. Neither group showed a change in blood pressure or levels of cholesterol, blood glucose or insulin. While Weight Watchers did not have much of an effect, ''it's as good as most academic centers do,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, chief of endocrinology at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York.
Dr. Hausknecht heard a different account from the Planned Parenthood clinic. ''There were many phone calls from the time she came into the clinic until that Sunday, when she turned up in the emergency room,'' he said. ''She had a great deal of pain and wanted refills of her prescription.'' The Planned Parenthood clinic, he said, tried to reach her last Monday and Tuesday but to no avail. ''At least some of the medical people did the right thing,'' Dr. Hausknecht said. ''Before we jump to conclusions, we ought to have facts.''
For anthrax in particular, scientists say they have promising ideas. But, they say, the work is in its earliest stages and is far from producing a new drug that could be tested in humans. One idea is to find an antitoxin, a molecule that neutralizes the toxins produced by anthrax bacteria. Since it is the toxins, not the bacteria themselves, that kill, antitoxins could block the germs' effects. Dr. R. John Collier, a professor of microbiology and molecular genetics at Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues started on this path several years ago, and now have two possible compounds that might work. They are nowhere near ready to give the compound to people and, as with all new drugs, there is a good possibility that they will either be too toxic or too ineffective for human use. One antitoxin acts like a decoy, attaching itself to sites on cells where active anthrax toxin binds and then combining with normal active forms of the toxin and inactivating them. The investigators began by testing the decoy toxin in rats, which die in 90 minutes if they are injected with the lethal anthrax toxin. But when Dr. Collier and his colleagues inject the rats with a mixture of one part decoy toxin to four parts active toxin, the rats ''survive with no symptoms,'' Dr. Collier said.
I have learned a thing or two close to home. I watched as my son took off like a gazelle when he was in middle school, uncoached and untrained, and went on to be a high school track and cross country star, and then to run on the varsity teams at a Division I university. He gave me tips -- relax your upper body, run on your mid-foot, raise your knees -- and they helped. But I always knew that there was a fundamental difference between him and me when it came to running far and fast. We still run together, but all that means is that we start out at the same place and end up at the same place. In between, he loses me. On the other hand, my son learned in college that there also was a noticeable difference between him and the runners who went on to become national champions. And it was not a matter of trying harder.
The first evidence that H.I.V.-1 jumped to humans from primates came about a decade ago, when scientists isolated a virus from an African chimpanzee that very closely resembled the AIDS virus now infecting tens of millions of people. The chimpanzee virus looked so much like H.I.V.-1 that it was almost irresistible to think that the animals had somehow given the virus to people. Its genes were arranged the same way, and it even had a distinctive gene, called vpu, that had never been seen in any other virus. While AIDS-like viruses were starting to emerge in other primates and in other animals, none looked so much like H.I.V.-1 as this chimpanzee one did. Adding to the evidence was a tantalizing snippet of another AIDS-like virus found in a tube of blood from a baby chimpanzee that had died. While the fragment was too small for anyone to be certain that it closely resembled H.I.V.-1, the genetic sequence from this second chimp lined up exactly with a piece of the first chimpanzee's virus.
''If we had had all of the data then,'' she said, ''it would have been so different.'' JoAnn M. Kuhne, the senior vice president for regulatory affairs at Inamed, said, ''There is more information on breast implants than on any other device in the history of the F.D.A.'' The company argues, in accord with groups like the Institute of Medicine, which reviewed implant data from large epidemiological studies a few years ago, that there is no conclusive evidence that the devices lead to serious diseases, which was the concern that resulted in their withdrawal from the market and the thousands of lawsuits against their makers. Dr. Stuart Bondurant, who was chairman of the Institute of Medicine committee that reviewed the epidemiological data, said the group, part of the National Academy of Sciences, found no evidence that the implants led to serious disease. The committee, which issued its report in 2000, considered, for example, cancer, neurological diseases, autoimmune diseases like lupus, and connective tissue diseases like arthritis.
''Based on the evidence we have seen, the V.A. should make a decision that diabetes is presumed to be service-connected based on Agent Orange exposure,'' said John Sommer, executive director of the Washington office of the American Legion. Dr. Gough, for one, said he did not doubt that the veterans would end up being compensated for diabetes. ''I think there is a feeling in this country that the Vietnam veterans got a bad shake, and I don't deny for a minute that that was true,'' Dr. Gough said. ''That has now extended to the constant suggestion that Agent Orange poisoned the men.'' Despite the questions about the Air Force study that plague many scientists, Dr. Gough said, ''I'm certain that diabetes will be turned into a compensable disease for Vietnam veterans.'' Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  A news analysis article on Thursday about an Air Force study linking the defoliant Agent Orange to diabetes among Vietnam veterans referred incorrectly to the defoliant's dioxin content. Dioxin is a trace contaminant of Agent Orange and other herbicides; it is not the main ingredient.
Mr. Shorter, who is now chairman of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, which performs drug tests for Olympic-related sports, said that before the 1972 Olympics, he attended an Olympic team meeting where American athletes were cautioned not to take steroids because they did not work. ''I was sitting in the back of the room with the weight guys, and they were laughing,'' he said. ''They literally had 'before' and 'after' pictures with them.'' Drugs came later to women's sports. In East Germany and other Eastern bloc countries, female swimmers and other athletes were secretly taking steroids in the 1960's, but almost no female athletes elsewhere were using them. Jan Todd of the University of Texas at Austin became a competitive lifter in the 1970's when she married Terry Todd and began tagging along when he went to gyms. ''I got caught up in this quest for strength,'' she said. Soon she was smashing world records. By the 1980's, however, many female weight lifters had begun taking steroids. Ms. Todd, who refused, saw her lifting career come to an end.
The specific advice can differ from specialist to specialist. Some, like Dr. Weinstein, say most people can continue with the sport they love although they may need to cut back a bit, running shorter distances or going more slowly. Others say to cross-train at least some of the time and others say the safest thing to do is to cross-train all the time until the pain is gone. You might end up cycling instead of running, or swimming instead of playing tennis. But unless it's something as serious as a broken bone or a ripped ligament or muscle, stopping altogether may be the worst thing to do. ''We want to keep you moving,'' said Dr. William Roberts, a sports medicine specialist at the University of Minnesota and a past president of the American College of Sports Medicine. ''Injured tissue heals better if it's under some sort of stress.'' He and others acknowledge that the advice to keep moving may come as a surprise and that some doctors feel uncomfortable giving it, worried that their patients will do too much, make things worse and then blame their doctor.
Dr. A. Bernard Ackerman, a dermatologist, spends much of his time diagnosing the potentially deadly cancer melanoma and other skin diseases. But when he returned from a recent trip to Israel, he was, well, deeply tanned. Burnished brown, in fact. Dr. Ackerman did not use sunscreen on his trip. He did not give any thought to the hundreds of moles that speckle his body. He did not even put a hat on his bald head. Other dermatologists may worry about getting melanoma from exposure to ultraviolet rays. But Dr. Ackerman, 67, a renowned expert in the field and the emeritus director of the Ackerman Academy of Dermatopathology in New York, said the link between melanoma and sun exposure was ''not proven.'' He has scrutinized, one by one, the widely held precepts about melanoma and the sun, and found the evidence wanting. ''The field is just replete with nonsense,'' he said.
Dr. Chlebowski and others also cautioned against assuming that the risks of hormone replacement therapy end when a woman stops taking the drugs. He said other hormone treatments can have delayed and lasting effects. Women who take the drug tamoxifen, which blocks estrogen's effects in the breast, for five years and then stop are protected from breast cancer for another decade, Dr. Chlebowski said. But tamoxifen also increases the risk of cancer of the uterine lining, and women who take the drug for five years and then stop are at increased risk for this cancer for another decade, he said. The women in the Women's Health Initiative study will be followed for years, he said, which should eventually determine if the breast cancer risk lingers, and, if so, for how long. Some doctors have asserted that it is safe to give hormone replacement therapy to women who are not at high risk of breast cancer. But, Dr. Chlebowski said, there is no good way to identify women whose risk is low. Other studies have indicated that the usual way of tallying risk factors, like age at menstruation, have not been particularly effective in determining a woman's risk.
A debate over using hormone replacement therapy in middle-aged women is focusing new attention to a quandary in science and medicine -- when different types of studies reach very different conclusions, what can be called truth? And what constitutes evidence? The issue pits disparate results from observational studies, in which large groups of people are tracked, often for years, against randomized clinical trials, in which participants are randomly assigned to receive, for example, a drug being tested or a dummy pill. Observational studies have been invaluable in showing that smoking leads to cancer and heart disease or that air pollution can be dangerous to health. But they have limitations not shared by randomized studies, in which participants are randomly assigned to have a treatment or not. On the other hand, randomized studies are time consuming, expensive and not always feasible. So on many questions in public health and medicine, researchers have relied on observational studies alone to reveal the truth.
The heart surgery data were clear, he said. The patients who did best were those whose surgeons were most experienced. Some busy doctors at community hospitals had better results than less-busy doctors at major medical centers. ''High-volume surgeons at lower-volume hospitals did just as well as high-volume surgeons at high-volume centers,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. ''And even if you were already at a high-volume hospital, it mattered if you chose a high-volume surgeon,'' he added. ''I think it's partly to do with the complexity of the procedure. How well you will do in the short and long term after a cardiovascular operation is often a function of how well your operation gets done.'' ''But what we found with many or most of the cancer operations was very different,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. A patient's chance of dying during or just after surgery was more related to the number of operations the hospital did and less to the number of operations the surgeon did. And, he reports in a paper that will soon be published in Annals of Surgery, cancer patients who go to hospitals that have more patients with their type of cancer also have better long-term survival.
For nearly nine months, doctors and researchers have been struggling with an intractable problem: how could two large high-quality studies come to diametrically different conclusions about menopause, hormone therapy and heart disease? The question arose in July, when scientists saw data from a large federal study called the Women's Health Initiative, which was ended early when it became clear that a widely used hormone-replacement drug, Prempro, had risks, including heart attacks, that exceeded its benefits. That finding directly contradicted previous studies showing that the hormones reduced heart disease risk -- in particular, the Nurses' Health Study, a large research effort that has been going on for years. The question is why. To answer it, researchers are reviewing the data, scrutinizing the design of each study and examining other research that may help reconcile the disparate findings. But so far, as they noted at a recent symposium at the Harvard School of Public Health, they have had no luck. As one explanation after another fails to hold up, the mystery deepens.
As for other health benefits, Dr. Hirsch said, ''the data get fuzzier and fuzzier.'' While scientists ask questions, a robust weight loss industry takes in tens of billions of dollars each year and reaches into all aspects of society. It includes diet foods and beverages, weight loss centers, diet books and prescription medicines, diet supplements, visits to doctors, lab tests, and surgery. The Federal Trade Commission estimates that annual revenue from sales of diet foods and beverages alone reaches $40 billion. Weight loss surgery alone has begun to hurt insurers. In Pennsylvania, the number of operations went from 674 in 1999 to 6,791 in 2003, and total charges went from $24 million to $242 million. Private insurance paid for 85 percent of the operations. In Florida, Blue Cross Blue Shield announced that it would not pay for the operation after this year, saying its costs nearly doubled in two years, to $17 million a year.
The findings are consistent with those from other studies that mostly focused on men. That led the American College of Sports Medicine and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to issue recommendations that men and women walk briskly for at least 30 minutes most days of the week or get an equivalent amount of exercise by other means, like running, swimming or bicycling. The studies establishing the 30-minute threshold are not ideal, Dr. Blair said. To eliminate the possibility that healthier people exercise, rather than the premise that exercise makes people healthier, a study would have to assign people at random to exercise or not and then look at outcomes like deaths from heart attacks. Such a study will never be done, Dr. Blair predicted. It would be too difficult to recruit and retain people and it could cost as much as a quarter of a billion dollars, he estimated.
In a series of meticulous experiments, researchers at the University of Wisconsin have pinpointed genetic changes that converted a chicken influenza virus into a deadly menace to humans. The chicken virus was found in Hong Kong in 1997. Though bird flu viruses usually do not infect humans, this one did, killing 6 of 18 people who contracted it, an extraordinarily high death rate for an infectious disease. To stop the virus, the government of Hong Kong ordered the slaughter of all chickens. But the virus has returned there this year -- not once but, after a lesser slaughter, a second time. Experts caution that the new work on the 1997 virus, being published  today in the journal Science, is only a first step, not a definitive answer to what turns a flu virus lethal. But, they say, it may lead to information allowing scientists to predict which emerging flu strains are especially dangerous.
Lyme disease is very difficult to catch, even from a deer tick in a Lyme-infested area, and can easily be stopped in its tracks with a single dose of an antibiotic, a new study shows. And two other studies conclude that prolonged and intensive treatment with antibiotics, a course of care advocated by a small group of doctors, does nothing for people with symptoms often attributed to chronic Lyme disease. These findings are in keeping with the assertions of researchers who say that in most cases, such symptoms have nothing at all to do with the disorder. The three studies, scheduled to be published on July 12 in The New England Journal of Medicine, were released yesterday because the journal's editors thought they were so important, with the onset of summer and the accompanying fear of Lyme disease. ''This is reassuring information for people who make decisions based on evidence,'' said Dr. Jeffrey M. Drazen, the journal's editor in chief.
In 1950, the death rate from heart disease was 307.4 per 100,000 people. In 1996, it was 134.6. In 1950, the stroke death rate per 100,000 people was 88.8. In 1996, it was 26.5. The decline ''is a true success story of grand proportions,'' said Dr. Gilbert S. Omenn, a public health expert who is executive vice president for medical affairs at the University of Michigan. Dr. David Jacobs, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, said the decline in the death rates was ''surely one of the great accomplishments of the century.'' The decline was a major reason people were living longer, Dr. Jacobs said. But Dr. Omenn noted that it had made many Americans vulnerable to other maladies, like cancer. According to the National Vital Statistics Report, the death rate from cancer has risen to 201.6 deaths per 100,000 in 1997 from 179.6 deaths per 100,000 in 1979.
The cox-2 story is more of a medical mystery. In theory, it makes little sense that blocking this enzyme should prevent cancer. Scientists have competing hypotheses to explain it. But they also have more than two decades of accumulating research, with animals, with cells grown in the laboratory and with human populations, all supporting the idea that blocking the cox-2 enzyme might prevent cancer. ''Everything is crystallizing,'' said Dr. Marcia Bertagnolli, a colon cancer specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ''What you really look for is that all the avenues of information are giving you the same information. Not just the epidemiology, not just the molecular biology, not just the genetics. Everything is converging on the same answer.'' But the researchers temper their enthusiasm with strong words of caution. The only way to know if cox-2 inhibitors can prevent cancers is to test them in large studies in which some people take the drugs and others take a dummy medication for comparison.
They asked specific questions. For walking speed, the investigators timed how long it took participants to walk 15 feet at their usual pace. The slowest 20 percent were considered to have this indicator of frailty. They tested grip strength, asking the participants to squeeze a device that measured their grip and counting the weakest 20 percent as having this frailty indicator. For weight loss, they asked whether people had lost 10 pounds or more in the past year. They learned about fatigue by asking the participants if they felt that everything they did was an effort and that they could not get themselves going. To learn about activity levels, they asked whether the participants had done any of 18 activities in the previous week, and, if so, how often they did them and for how long. From there they calculated the number of calories expended in exercise. Those in the bottom quarter had this frailty indicator.
Mrs. Brandt, who is 63, says that after her initial diagnosis and a lumpectomy, she went to the University of Pennsylvania's hospital and she became a patient of Dr. John Glick. She had radiation treatments and chemotherapy at Penn and is now going through more chemotherapy there because her cancer has spread. ''I never considered going anywhere else,'' Mrs. Brandt said. ''Dr. Glick is at the top of his research game, and from the beginning he instilled great confidence in me and my family.'' Other patients, Dr. Glick said, are eager to return to their local doctors for chemotherapy and follow-up care, and he encourages it whenever he thinks it is appropriate. Penn has a network of community physicians, and other academic hospitals, like Memorial Sloan-Kettering, have suburban satellite centers. ''We try to get patients back into our network of community physicians if we think the same care can be given,'' Dr. Glick said. If there is a specialized surgical technique or treatment that is available only at Penn, though, he encourages patients to stay at Penn for that treatment.
And yet, most of the scientists at the meeting said, the question no longer is ''Will it happen?'' but rather ''When?'' ''There's nothing bigger,'' Dr. Austad said. ''If we could do it, there's nothing bigger. It's the big enchilada.'' Correction:  March 10, 1999, Wednesday  An article in Science Times yesterday about research on extending the human life span misstated the classification of the canary, whose life span of two years appears to be genetically determined. It is of the class Aves, not Mammalia.
But neither study addressed the question of what to tell younger women taking estrogen. ''We are trying to extrapolate to scenarios that we don't have clinical trials to cover,'' Dr. Hays said. Menopause that comes on overnight after a woman's ovaries are removed is often very different from menopause that begins gradually with age. With surgical menopause, noted Dr. Robert Brzyski, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio, the symptoms ''just seem more profound and dramatic.'' This means that many women who had their ovaries removed say they cannot function without estrogen to soothe their symptoms. They also worry about bone loss, which is precipitated by ovary surgery and can be forestalled with estrogen. The women who wrote to Dr. Hays wanted to know what the study's findings meant for their risk of stroke, or dementia. If they started taking estrogen in their 40's or even earlier, they wondered, when, if ever, should they stop?
Dr. Needleman decided to put the cox-2 hypothesis to a test, giving the Searle drug to patients with F.A.P.. If it squelched polyp formation in these patients, he reasoned, it would make sense to go on to test it in people in the general population who had had one or two polyps -- and so were at risk for colon cancer. If it failed in the F.A.P. patients, Dr. Needleman said, ''we would have stopped all trials of cox-2 in cancer.'' The study, he added, ''was the proof of concept in every way.'' The study, conducted by Searle with the cancer institute, included 83 patients and lasted six months. It found that patients who took Celebrex had a 28 percent reduction in the number of polyps, compared with a 5 percent reduction in those taking a placebo. The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug late last year for F.A.P. patients.
In fact, a mifepristone abortion can be a lengthy ordeal, in contrast to a surgical abortion, which is over in minutes. The Food and Drug Administration said mifepristone could be used to induce abortions only through seven weeks of pregnancy, dated from the first day of a woman's last menstrual period. After swallowing three mifepristone pills, the woman must return to her doctor's office two days later to take another drug, misoprostol, that makes the uterus contract, expelling the fetal tissue. Then she must come back again two weeks later to be sure the abortion is complete. The drug combination causes bleeding and cramping that typically lasts 9 to 16 days, but it is about 95 percent effective in completely aborting a pregnancy. If the drugs fail, the woman must have a surgical abortion. While in theory, at least, any licensed doctor could offer mifepristone, many say now that they have no intention of doing so and others say they will try to avoid providing the drug.
''We sought relations with both Merck and at that time Searle, which now is Pharmacia,'' Dr. Hawk said. ''Pharmacia was interested.'' ''We started a battery of studies,'' he said. They include studies of patients at high risk for colon cancer; patients with a precancerous condition that puts them at high risk of esphogeal cancer; patients at high risk of basal cell carcinoma, a skin cancer; and those at high risk of squamous cell carcinoma, another skin cancer. The institute is studying patients with early stage bladder cancer and patients with precancerous lesions in their mouths. It is studying former smokers with abnormal cells in the lining of their lungs and women with abnormal cells in their breasts, which place them at high risk of cancer. It also is studying men with prostate cancer, giving them Celebrex before they have prostate surgery to see whether it can affect the cancer cells.
Parents at fertility clinics will be offered sophisticated genetic screening of their embryos before selecting which ones to implant. Already, Dr. Stock said, some parents are selecting embryos of the sex they want. More subtle preferences will come next. If a genetic pattern for general intelligence is ever established, and many wonder if it ever will be, it will obviously be much in demand. Next would come the ability not only to pick genetic patterns but to alter them. Parents might eliminate one that predisposed to breast cancer and enhance the activity of one for height. The effect will go beyond new and improved babies. ''A lot of the differences between people have biologic underpinnings,'' Dr. Stock said. ''Now, we have a dogma of egalitarianism. Everyone's the same.'' But, he said, we know that is not really true, and there will be genetic evidence spelling out why. Genetic tests will disclose significant differences between individuals and between groups, he said, and he foresees political consequences, as individuals argue that their genes determined their behavior.
But, the committee said, Dr. Togias should have reported the first subject's experience to the review board. Dr. Miller stressed that clinical research must go on. ''Ellen sacrificed her life in an important study,'' Dr. Miller said. The committee said the university would redouble its efforts to ensure safety in its clinical research. And that raised questions of whether the Food and Drug Administration should have been involved. The committee said in its report that the institutional review board should have asked Dr. Togias to find out whether he needed the F.D.A.'s approval to do the study. The agency, Dr. Miller said, often has information from drug company studies that can address safety questions. It could also have required the Hopkins researchers to do additional studies of their own, perhaps giving the drug to animals, before giving it to people. Drug companies are required to get F.D.A. permission before doing a study like the one at Johns Hopkins, said Dr. Bert Spilker, senior vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Complying with the agency's requirements typically would take one to two years and cost $1 million to $5 million, Dr. Spilker said.
Dr. Friedman, however, begs to differ. The statistics let scientists get beyond impressions and focus on the evidence. He is, in a way, an unexpected figure to insert himself into the highly charged politics of obesity. He left clinical medicine in 1980 after discovering that his true passion was the laboratory. By 1981, he had begun his scientific career, and within a few years he was taking on what seemed like an impossibly onerous task, finding a gene whose absence made mice grow massively obese. He keeps mementos from those days. He still has the purchase order, from December 1986, for the first batch of mice he used for the experiment. Hanging on his office wall is a framed strip of white paper with black blotches, the data that on Sunday morning, May 8, 1994, revealed he had found the gene that he named leptin. ''To me, those data are as beautiful as the Mona Lisa,'' he said.
''If you've looked at pictures of Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was a teenager, he just looked naturally muscular,'' said Dr. Robert Ferrell, a professor of human genetics at the University of Pittsburgh who in a small study found no major genetic differences between professional bodybuilders and ordinary people. ''Everyone has run into people like that who have great muscle definition and size. That's what I'm interested in.'' Certainly the baby's mutation was unusual, Dr. Schuelke said. He and his colleagues tested 200 people not related to the child and did not find it. But there are many ways to disable a gene, and it is possible, researchers said, that some naturally strong people have myostatin genes that function poorly, or not at all. Eventually, experts say, it may be possible to use drugs to deplete myostatin. One way to do that could be with antibodies that block it, a path that Wyeth is pursuing. The company has begun safety tests in humans with the goal of treating muscular dystrophy and muscle wasting.
Many independent clinic owners say they survive only by finding a way to distinguish themselves from Planned Parenthood. Dr. Hern decided that because his Planned Parenthood competitor did only first-trimester abortions, he would compete by focusing on abortions in the second and third trimester. While the vast majority of women who have abortions are in their first trimester, the thought was that those who were later in pregnancy would be drawn to Dr. Hern. But now even that niche is starting to erode, he said. At a recent medical meeting, Dr. Hern said, doctors crowded into a session on late-term abortions. ''The startling thing to me was that a very large room was filled -- packed,'' Dr. Hern said. ''Twenty years ago, there were just two or three doctors in the country doing late abortions.'' A Lucrative Business Dr. Ramos said the situation at his clinic in Las Vegas is close to ideal. There are no protesters. Business is good -- he does about 3,000 abortions a year, charging $300 for a first-trimester abortion. And with four clinics in the city, everyone is getting by. Dr. Ramos says he made the perfect career choice when he began doing abortions nearly three decades ago. ''There is less work and more income,'' he explained.
First it was estrogen and heart disease. People knew -- or thought they did -- that taking estrogen pills at menopause, when estrogen levels wane, protected women with heart disease. People knew -- or thought they did -- that high-fiber diets protected against colon cancer. Now, however, preliminary data from a large federal study indicate that at least initially hormone replacement therapy is not protecting postmenopausal women from heart disease and may even be leading to a tiny increase in heart attacks, strokes and blood clots in the legs and lungs. The data are far from conclusive, and few would conclude at this point that estrogen was dangerous. But the point is that no one really knows whether it protects against heart disease. Last week, two large and rigorous federal studies of high-fiber diets failed to show that they protected against colon cancer. Once again, the results emphasize that this truth about diet and cancer is far from established.
They did, and so did many others: 40 percent of the runners never finished. Mr. Spence came in third, 40 seconds behind the winner, with an average pace of 5 minutes 11 seconds per mile. He went down in sports history as one of the few American marathoners to win a medal in a world championship. ''Was I the third most fit person in that race? Absolutely not,'' Mr. Spence said. ''Was I the third most talented? Absolutely not.'' What made the difference, he said, was his training and strategy. Now, with plenty of time to prepare for the races in Osaka and Beijing, USA Track &amp; Field sponsored a small meeting for coaches, distance runners and trainers on getting to the medals podium. Mr. Spence told how he prevailed in Tokyo; exercise physiologists shared research results; and coaches of the champion American Olympic marathoners Meb Keflezighi and Deena Kastor revealed their athletes' preparations.
So what should a scientist do? ''I'm not aware of anyone refusing money,'' Dr. Gordis said. ''That's the acid test.''
Dr. Richard Schubert, a fee-for-service internist in Washington, says he spends whatever time it takes with his patients -- 30 minutes for a routine office visit, an hour for a consultation. ''It costs patients more money, they have to pay for it out of pocket, they have to decide if they think it's good value for the service,'' he said. ''Maybe you think spending the extra money on a doctor is not important and you'd rather get a B.M.W. You have to decide how you want to spend your money.'' Many patients say that they are willing to pay the price for a doctor who showers them with attention. Harry Haber, the president of Ginsey Industries, a company in Bellmawr, N.J., that manufactures and distributes novelty bathroom accessories, said he provided  an Aetna/US Healthcare health maintenance organization for his 150 employees and himself. But he and his wife are patients of Dr. Fenton of Philadelphia, paying most of the cost themselves.
''We're all after the same goal here,'' Dr. Oxford said. Dr. Taubenberger's current work gives virologists hope that their goal is in sight. It a ''tour de force,'' said Dr. Robert Webster, a flu expert from St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, in a telephone interview from Hong Kong, where he is instituting a new surveillance system to look for new and potentially lethal flu strains. Dr. Taubenberger and his colleagues began by finding shards of the 1918 virus in shreds of lung tissue from flu victims, preserved since 1918. Then they fished the fragments out with powerful methods of molecular biology and pieced them together. The scientists chose as their first target the virus's hemagglutinin  gene, which directs the production of a protein that the virus uses to hoist  itself into lung cells. Many virologists thought that changes in the  hemagglutinin gene determined how infectious and how dangerous a flu strain could be.
In a letter that has stunned many leading fertility specialists, the acting head of their professional society's ethics committee says it is sometimes acceptable for couples to choose the sex of their children by selecting either male or female embryos and discarding the rest. The group, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, establishes positions on ethical issues, and most clinics say they abide by them. One fertility specialist, Dr. Norbert Gleicher, whose group has nine centers and who had asked for the opinion, was quick to act it. ''We will offer it immediately,'' Dr. Gleicher said of the sex-selection method. ''Frankly, we have a list of patients who asked for it.'' Couples would have to undergo in vitro fertilization, and then their embryos would be examined in the first few days when they consisted of just eight cells. Dr. Gleicher is chairman of the board of the Center for Human Reproduction, which has five fertility centers in the Chicago area and four others in Manhattan and Brooklyn.  The acting chairman of the ethics committee at the reproductive medicine society, John Robertson, an ethicist and lawyer at the University of Texas, said he was responding to a request by Dr. Gleicher for clarification of the society's position. Mr. Robertson said that he wrote the letter after consulting with another committee member and that he thought it reflected the group's position.
Yes, of course, there is probably a health benefit to all that dieting and exercising. But there is also an implicit self-righteousness. When the slothful person gets sick, colleagues whisper: ''Of course. What can you expect if you don't take care of yourself?'' The idea that health and beauty are linked goes back to Alfred Russell Wallace, who, with Charles Darwin, developed the theory of evolution. Like Darwin, Wallace was puzzled by the observation that male birds tend to be brightly colored, even though their fiery plumage can make it hard to hide from predators. Darwin's idea was that male birds evolved to have brilliant colors because females wanted them that way. Wallace concluded that females chose the more brightly colored males because they were healthier. Thus an academic endeavor was born. Since the puzzle of the birds was described in the mid-to-late 19th century, it has become almost a sine qua non that what people think is beautiful is in some way correlated with good health.
Yet, researchers say, old notions persist. ''There is just this embedded belief that fixing an artery is a good thing,'' said Dr. Eric Topol, an interventional cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. In particular, Dr. Topol said, more and more people with no symptoms are now getting stents. According to an analysis by Merrill Lynch, based on sales figures, there will be more than a million stent operations this year, nearly double the number performed five years ago. Some doctors still adhere to the old model. Others say that they know it no longer holds but that they sometimes end up opening blocked arteries anyway, even when patients have no symptoms. Dr. David Hillis, an interventional cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, explained: ''If you're an invasive cardiologist and Joe Smith, the local internist, is sending you patients, and if you tell them they don't need the procedure, pretty soon Joe Smith doesn't send patients anymore. Sometimes you can talk yourself into doing it even though in your heart of hearts you don't think it's right.''
Rates of the most common form of breast cancer dropped a startling 15 percent from August 2002 to December 2003, researchers reported yesterday. The reason, they believe, may be because during that time, millions of women abandoned hormone treatment for the symptoms of menopause after a large national study concluded that the hormones slightly increased breast cancer risk. The new analysis of breast cancer rates, by researchers from the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and presented at a breast cancer conference in San Antonio, was based on a recent report by the National Cancer Institute on the cancer's incidence. Investigators cautioned that they would like to see the findings confirmed in other studies, including, perhaps, in data from Canada and Europe, and they would like to see what happens in the next few years. ''Epidemiology can never prove causality,'' said Dr. Peter Ravdin, a medical oncologist at the M.D. Anderson center and one of the authors of the analysis.
What if, by chance, researchers stumbled on an animal test that predicted whether an antidepressant drug might prompt suicide as a rare side effect in people? ''We would immediately go back and test all of our drugs,'' Dr. Ruffolo said. If the animal tests indicated that the drugs were linked to suicide, he added, the company would use the test to search for other drugs that were not. Even so, animal research can be a trap, researchers say, because it forces companies to zero in on drugs that generate the same results in limited tests. That cycle produces lots of me-too drugs but little insight into how to produce better antidepressants that could help more people and perhaps even make them more cheerful and optimistic. Maybe even drugs that could alleviate concerns that some patients might commit suicide when they first start taking them. ''Would you miss new classes of drugs that are antidepressants and work by completely different mechanisms?'' Dr. Ruffolo asked. ''The answer is absolutely yes.''
Growth hormone therapy should not be used outside a controlled clinical trial, said Dr. Blackman, who directs the laboratory of clinical investigation at the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine. The researchers were asking whether growth hormone and, possibly, sex hormones might be a key to the debilitating changes that occur with aging. Starting about age 30, growth hormone levels start to decline. By age 60, people can have half as much as they did at 30. Testosterone, in men, declines, too, and, in women, estrogen levels plummet after menopause. The hypothesis was that the effects of aging -- shriveling muscles, thinning bones, increased body fat, especially in the abdomen, a loss of energy and enthusiasm, might be linked to hormone deficiencies, and, in particular, a lack of growth hormone. People who lack growth hormone -- for example, patients with a genetic defect or a tumor of the pituitary gland that prevents the hormone from being made -- have all these signs and symptoms of aging, and they are reversed when they take growth hormone injections.
''A reward is something you work for,'' said Dr. Roy Wise, an addiction researcher at the National Institute of Drug Abuse. ''It makes you want to go back for more.'' ''It's a positive feedback in the brain that keeps saying, 'yes, yes, yes,' '' he said. And, he added, while some people may crave heroin and others cocaine, others alcohol and others, perhaps, exercise, ''the common denominator, the excitement in all these behaviors is the tendency to return to them again and again.'' ''That's what the dopamine system is for,'' Dr. Wise said. ''The bottom line is that you will like anything you can do that turns on these dopamine neurons.'' Dr. Wise acknowledged that each addictive drug can have a different effect. Morphine makes people drowsy. Amphetamine allows people to go for days without sleep. Yet, he said, those effects are, in a sense, side effects, and not the reason people crave these drugs.
Dr. Stephen A. Feig, a radiologist who directs breast imaging at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, said, ''Screening has weathered controversies before and it will continue to do so.'' Health insurance companies usually pay for mammograms. Joseph Luchok, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America said, ''If a procedure is covered it would stay covered until the medical community came to the opinion that it is not a useful procedure.'' But some doctors who want to advise their patients confess that they are whipsawed by the dueling experts. ''The debate has become so sophisticated from a methodology viewpoint that as a doctor my head is spinning,'' said Dr. Barron H. Lerner, an internist and historian at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Lerner wrote ''Breast Cancer Wars'' (Oxford University Press, 2001). ''You read the article in The Lancet and you nod your head yes. Then you read the studies by people on the other side and you nod your head yes,'' Dr. Lerner said. ''We're witnessing this fight between the pro-  and anti-mammography forces and they're both arguing that 'my data is better and we're right and they're wrong.' ''
Then, Dr. Shapiro said, the group tried their antibiotic on gram positive bacteria, which do not have the enzyme the drugs were made to attack. They expected that the bacteria would be impervious. But, she said, ''to our astonishment, it hit anthrax and multidrug resistant strep and staph.'' She said she had no idea why the drugs worked against these microbes. Dr. Shapiro stressed that the work was just beginning. ''If I were to give odds, I would say we have a 10 percent chance of getting all the way to an antibiotic,'' she said. ''We are just now making enough to treat a rat. We are three years from availability if everything worked.'' GINA KOLATA TREATMENTS
Nor did mammography lead to fewer mastectomies, the investigators say. In the Malmo study, for example, 424 women in the mammography group and just 339 in the control group had mastectomies. One reason may be that doctors aggressively treated some tiny tumors found in mammograms -- tumors that might never have developed into cancer or might never have been noticed in a woman's lifetime. So far, just one country, Switzerland, has taken action as a result of the study, deciding not to offer a national mammography screening program. Dr. Gianfranco Domenighetti of the Swiss Network for Health Technology Assessment said the decision was heavily influenced by the Danish research. But Switzerland did not have a national program; it was thinking of starting one. It is a different matter in a country like the United States, which has a longstanding policy of urging women to have mammograms. Once a program has been highly promoted and advanced as a way to save lives, said Dr. Barnett Kramer, the associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health, it can be difficult to suggest that guidelines be revised.

Cloned mice also tend to have developmental abnormalities, taking longer to reach milestones like eye opening and ear twitching, Dr. Yanagimachi has found. Cow clones are often born with enlarged hearts or lungs that do not develop properly, said Dr. Mark E. Westhusin, a cloning expert at Texas A &amp; M University in College Station, Tex. Dolly herself, while apparently healthy, grew fat and had to be separated from the other sheep and put on a diet. But her experience is difficult to interpret since it is hard to draw conclusions about a propensity to obesity from one animal. The genetic effects most often seem to be fatal at the very start of life, researchers say. With cattle, for example, 100 attempts to create a clone typically result in a single live calf, Dr. Westhusin said. Cloning mice is more efficient, Dr. Yanagimachi said. But even then, only 2 percent to 3 percent of his attempts succeed.
Planning Diet and Exercise Dr. Fernstrom says she is still dumbfounded when she sees what many do to try to lose weight. Over and over again, she says, her patients will tell her they drank fruit juice with abandon or ate bags of fat-free pretzels, reasoning that because these foods had no fat, they are not fattening. ''Sometimes I call it the great hope of American eating, that nonfat means non caloric,'' Dr. Fernstrom said. ''This has been a sabotage.'' Dr. Serdula of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found the same thing in the national survey she directed. About 35 percent of the men and 40 percent of the women who were trying to lose weight said they were controlling their food intake by eating less fat. That simply does not work, Dr. Serdula said. ''Calories do count,'' she said. While high-fat foods typically have many calories, so do many low-fat foods, including ones like nonfat cookies or muffins that dieters buy in place of the real thing, obesity experts point out.
The principal investigators of both studies think they know the problem. In interviews, both Dr. Caballero and Philip R. Nader, who directed the study of 96 schools and is an emeritus research professor at the University of California at San Diego, came to the same conclusion: the intervention was not enough. It is necessary to change the children's total experience, not just what happens at school. ''Not only the school, but the family, the community, the grocery store,'' Dr. Caballero said. Others researchers are not so sure. No one knows why children got fatter, says Dr. Rudolph Leibel, an obesity researcher at Columbia University. It is clear, of course, that they must be eating more or exercising less, but the difference may be tiny -- a few dozen extra calories a day will, over the years, pile on pounds and a change like that is ''unmeasurable,'' Dr. Leibel said. And no one has any good evidence that proposed solutions will make any difference.
''Some physicians and health care providers find it difficult to talk about these things,'' Dr. Mitchell said. ''And it takes a lot of time and effort, which for the most part is not well reimbursed.'' But even when the issue of ending aggressive care arises, family members often disagree about what is going on in the mind of a patient. ''A family member sees what they see as a light of recognition, even if other people standing there can't be sure they saw it,'' Dr. DeKosky said. ''On the other hand, a flicker of recognition isn't the answer. It isn't saying, 'Yes, he's still in there.' '' In Mrs. Mull's case, her daughter, Patricia Hollar, was torn. ''I walked for a while, and me and the man upstairs did some talking,'' she said. Her heart told her that maybe enough was enough, she said. But she feared being too hasty and worried that although she was in charge of deciding her mother's care, her two brothers and sister might think she was condemning their mother to death.
''The drug discovery process is now and always has been an 'aha' experience,'' said Dr. Alan Hillman, a professor of medicine and health care management at the University of Pennsylvania. ''I don't think our society would have accepted the marketing or the selling of a drug for erectile dysfunction as recently as 20 or 25 years ago,'' he said. ''You need to have the right researcher at the right moment in history.'' Those involved in marketing Viagra agree. Yes, they say, Viagra was discovered by accident when researchers for its maker, Pfizer, noticed that men taking an experimental drug for heart disease had erections as a side effect. But, said David Brinkley, the worldwide team leader for Viagra at Pfizer, ''maybe 10 or 20 years ago, if we had seen the exact same effect, we would have dismissed it and said, 'Oh, it's all in their heads.' '' ''I think the timing was right for Viagra,'' Mr. Brinkley said. ''It's ironic. I hear a lot of times the company is criticized for creating something out of nothing, that erectile dysfunction is something that people in the marketing department of Pfizer created so we could make a lot of money.'' Erectile dysfunction, he added, ''is not something we invented in a marketing retreat.''
On the other hand, Mr. Provos can miss steganography -- he said he had trouble finding small messages and was unable to detect a short message in a photograph that was sent to him. He was told beforehand  that an unencrypted message had been inserted. Mr. Provos publishes his research, enabling others to know how he detects steganography and, as a consequence, how to avoid his detection system. ''When I started my research, which was a couple of years ago, it was, of course, in a completely different political situation,'' he said. Now, he says, he asked himself again if publication was advisable. He concluded it was, arguing that research thrived when people could freely exchange ideas. Of course, those whose business it is to intercept terrorist communications would never reveal anything they have learned about steganog raphy. Asked what the National Security Agency -- the nation's codemaking and codebreaking agency -- knows, Dr. Robert Morris, a retired cryptographer who was chief scientist there, said, ''We wouldn't talk about it.''
Impressed by mounting evidence that deaths from heart disease could be significantly reduced with aggressive treatments, a national panel recommended yesterday that millions more Americans take powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs or immediately alter their diets. The group, sponsored by the federal government, proposes nearly tripling the number of adults who should be taking cholesterol-lowering drugs and raising by 25 percent the number who should be on a cholesterol-lowering diet. ''We want to recommend more aggressive treatment to people who are at very high risk,'' said Dr. James I. Cleeman, the coordinator of the group that issued the guidelines, the National Cholesterol Education Program of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. ''And,'' he added, paraphrasing Shakespeare, ''there are more of them out there than are dreamt of in your philosophy.'' The recommendations increase the number of Americans who are candidates for cholesterol-lowering drugs to about 36 million from the 13 million under the old guidelines. The number who should be on cholesterol-lowering diets is raised to 65 million from the current 52 million.
The weight range studies lead to an inevitable conclusion, obesity experts say: if researchers want to enable fat people to lose weight permanently, they have to enable them to change their natural weight range. And that means identifying the biochemical signals between the brain and the body that control weight. Not the Answer, but a Clue Not too long ago, Dr. Jeffrey Friedman of Rockefeller University in New York thought he had found the elusive signal between body and brain, and most obesity researchers agreed. In 1994, after eight years of work, he finally isolated one defective gene that made a strain of mice grow immensely obese. The gene's role was to direct fat cells to make a small protein that acts like a hormone, signaling the brain. It seemed to be the missing link between body and mind, allowing the exquisite control over eating that could put animals, and people, into rigidly regulated weight ranges.
But to the investigators' shock, there was no decline in the number of toddlers who developed advanced cancers, and the death rates from the disease stayed unchanged. ''It was an absolutely stone cold negative outcome,'' said Dr. Steven Goodman, an associate professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, who was not associated with the study. The scientists had to declare that the screening test, seemingly so promising, should be abandoned. Their finding thrust them into the debate over a growing assortment of screening tests used to search for disease in adults and children. In an editorial with the neuroblastoma papers in The New England Journal of Medicine last week, Dr. George Cunningham of the California Department of Health Services wrote: ''As these studies illustrate, the decision about whether or not to screen should be driven not by the availability of a laboratory screening test, but by careful analysis of outcomes, including saving the lives of the screened newborns or improving the quality of their lives.''
In metastasis, he added, when cancers spread, the cells activate genes that normally are used only in embryo development, when cells migrate, and in wound healing. But so many genetic changes give rise to a question: how does a cell acquire them? In any cell division, there is a one-in-a-million chance that a mutation will accidentally occur, Dr. Weinberg notes. The chance of two mutations is one in a million million and the chance of three is one in a million million million million. This slow mutation rate results from the fact that healthy cells quickly repair damage to their DNA. ''DNA repair stands as the dike between us and the inundation of mutations,'' Dr. Weinberg said. But one of the first things a cell does when it starts down a road to cancer is to disable repair mechanisms. In fact, BRCA1 and 2, the gene mutations that predispose people to breast and ovarian cancer, as well as some other inherited cancer genes, disable these repair systems.
It involved 497 men with chronic diseases.  age 54 and older, at the Veterans Affairs General Medical Clinic in White River Junction, Vt. The researchers assigned half the patients to have their usual office visits. The others had to wait twice as long as usual between office visits but they had received,  instead, three scheduled telephone calls from their doctor in the interim. Each call lasted about 10 minutes. Two years later, the patients who received the calls had 19 percent fewer office visits, used 14 percent less medication, and had fewer admissions to the hospital and shorter stays when they were admitted. Their medical costs were about 28 percent less. Dr. Wasson and his colleagues tried twice to replicate their success. Both times, he said, the doctors were willing to make the calls, but willingness was not enough. One attempt was at a handful of Veterans Affairs' medical centers. The doctors, who were expected to wedge the phone calls into their already busy days, said they simply could not do it.
''He should have banned it,'' Dr. Wolfe said. ''As long as this stuff stays on the market, people will think it's safe.'' Dr. David A. Kessler, dean of the Yale medical school and F.D.A. commissioner from 1990 until 1997, agrees with Dr. Wolfe on ephedra and wonders whether some of Dr. McClellan's other ideas -- like ones for speeding up drug approval -- will make much difference. ''You see some good instincts, and some that are of concern,'' Dr. Kessler said. ''But he's certainly pushing the agency to new initiatives.'' For his part, Dr. McClellan takes things as they come. ''It helps to focus on what the right thing to do is,'' he said. ''You can't ask, How can I go through the day without getting a negative editorial or without getting a negative reaction from one group or another. We have to make decisions and we will be criticized.''
''I said, the real question for me is, if you walk in here next year and you have had some event -- a heart attack, breast cancer, a stroke that leaves you in a wheelchair -- how will you feel? Will you say: 'It's fine because I really needed the medication. I couldn't live without it?' '' The patient, she said, looked at her, stunned, and then replied, ''Now that you put it that way, maybe I should try coming off.''
''Here you have an area where care was being provided on the basis of consensus,'' he said, meaning doctors' general clinical impressions that arthroscopy was called for in osteoarthritic knee patients. Now a study has provided objective data. ''It was an absolutely elegant study by an esteemed health services researcher,'' Dr. Perlin said of the principal investigator, Dr. Nelda P. Wray, chief of health services research at Baylor College of Medicine and chief of general medicine at the Houston V.A. Medical Center. Dr. Wray's study, published on July 11 in The New England Journal of Medicine, involved 180 patients with osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease, in the knee. They were randomly assigned to have either a placebo operation or one of two versions of the knee surgery. One version involved lavage, flushing the joint with large volumes of water. The other involved lavage and debridement, cutting away rough pieces of tissue before washing the joint clean. Patients in all three groups said afterward that they felt better, but none improved in objective tests of knee functions.
Mammographers are not convinced, and they stress the advantages of finding cancers early. ''Early diagnosis translates for many -- but not all -- women into lower mortality,'' said Dr. Edward Sickles, a professor of radiology at the University of California at San Francisco.  And doubts cast on a test's effectiveness do not mean that individual people will want to forgo them. But some researchers studying the issue say they have been personally sobered by the unforeseen consequences that can arise when seemingly healthy people sign up for a screening test. Dr. Stephen Swensen, for example, said he began a study of lung cancer screening three years ago, hoping to find that it could prevent deaths from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death for American men and women. He screened 1,520 smokers and former smokers with spiral CT lung scans. As he expected, Dr. Swensen, the chairman of the radiology department at the Mayo Clinic, found lung cancers -- 37 malignant tumors.  But he also found more than 2,800 suspicious lung nodules, hard lumps of cells ranging in size from a grain of rice to a pea, that required further testing. Sometimes the testing included chest surgery, which itself carries a 4 percent risk of death.
She said her work suggested that even if researchers could grow human embryo clones to the blastocyst stage, the stage of development occurring when stem cells arise, most of the blastocysts might be unusable.  The embryos may have few stem cells, and the few that are present may have abnormal chromosomes. ''My results do not mean that it can't be done,'' Dr. Dominko said. But, she and others said, the monkey story, which she told in a lecture and in interviews at the meeting in Washington on Dec. 3, is something of a reality check in a context of cloning hype and, at times, near-hysteria. ''I think this is really a profound story,'' she said. ''We can make all sorts of things that look like embryos, but what are we really making?'' It also raises questions about the success of cloning in general. Dr. Ian Wilmut, the scientist who created Dolly, a sheep that was the first animal cloned from cells of an adult, said at the meeting that there were as many species in which cloning failed, as those in which it succeeded. While scientists have cloned sheep, cattle, mice, goats and pigs, no one has been able to clone rabbits, rats, cats, dogs or monkeys.
If leptin's role is to maintain body fat, then the hormone might be valuable in helping people who have lost large amounts of weight to avoid regaining it, Dr. Flier said. When very fat people get down to the desired weight, they look normal but are physiologically the equivalent of a person who is starving to death: their metabolic rates are low, they are infertile, they crave food. Most gain back every pound they lost. Perhaps if they took leptin, they would be able to stay thin. Despite their disappointment in the first leptin studies, investigators said they were confident that leptin would lead them to the complete molecular pathway that the body uses to control eating, and weight, with the result that companies could find drugs to effectively intervene. ''Yes, it is true that leptin as an overall panacea for obesity has been disappointing,'' Dr. O'Rahilly said. ''But that doesn't mean that leptin hasn't been one of the most fascinating discoveries in the 20th century.''
The marathon at the Olympics in Athens this month is fearsome, so grueling that even an elite athlete is liable to feel at least a moment of trepidation. The 26-mile, 385-yard course includes, among other body-bashing stretches, a 13-mile hill so steep it has been described as the equivalent of running up a five-story building every mile. Your everyday, normal sort of runner, like me, will be breathless just watching. But many of the Olympic runners will make it look easy. I can run up that mountain only in my dreams, no matter how hard I work. The difference between me and them is so great that I find myself consumed with curiosity over exactly how much of running fast and far is innate, and how much can be attributed to training, motivation and technique. I wonder how those remarkable athletes got to be who they are. And I wonder what they know, and what, if anything, people like me can learn to be more accomplished.
The work is continuing, at Edmonton and at other medical centers, including Massachusetts General,  and Dr. Edmond A. Ryan at the University of Alberta said he remained optimistic. ''It's going well, but it's not perfect,'' he said. Others are less enthusiastic. Dr. Nathan said he was now convinced that without stopping the underlying disease, ''there is no reason to think the diabetes will not return.'' So Dr. Faustman set out to find a way to suppress the immune system's attack, thinking she could then successfully transplant islet cells into naturally diabetic mice. After years of work, she and her colleagues hit on a method that worked. It involved training immune system cells in the blood not to attack islet cells and, at the same time, killing immune system cells in the pancreas where an attack on islet cells was under way. It was time for what the researchers thought would be the ultimate test. First they would stop the underlying diabetes with their new method. Then they would transplant islet cells into the mice. And, to prove that the cells had cured the mice, they would take the transplanted cells out and watch the diabetes return.
''There are other drugs that are strikingly similar to doxycycline,'' Dr. Fauci said. One is erythromycin. There is also a wide array of penicillinlike drugs on the market. Like most anthrax strains, the anthrax bacteria that infected two people in Florida and two in New York are said to be sensitive to penicillin. ''What happens if it is a microbe like the one we are seeing now that is in fact sensitive to penicillin?'' Dr. Fauci asked. ''Then you have a whole host of drugs that can be used,'' including amoxicillin and erythromycin. Experts said Cipro was approved for use for inhalation anthrax because it is the drug for which scientists had the best data when the government was looking for something to recommend against terrorist attacks. In a small study of monkeys by the Defense Department, Cipro had been shown to prevent inhalation anthrax at doses comparable to what people would take. Though animal data would not normally be enough to warrant the approval of a new use of a drug, there are little data on drugs for use in anthrax because it would be unethical to expose people to them in tests.
''This really has our heads spinning,'' said Dr. Steven DeKosky, who directs the University of Pittsburgh's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. He and others agonize over what to do. As researchers, they respect the F.D.A.'s strict demands that drugs be shown to be both safe and efficacious before they are approved. They also know too well that some drugs that seemed promising emerged as useless, or even dangerous, when subjected to the agency's scrutiny. Yet they see the anguish of family members who are desperate for something to slow the progress of the degenerative brain disease. ''We are all conflicted about this,'' said Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Mayo Clinic's Alzheimer's Disease Research Center in Rochester, Minn. ''We want to help our patients and not endanger them, and at the same time we have a moral and ethical obligation to follow the F.D.A.'s guideline.'' Some experts, like Dr. Lennart Mucke, a neurologist at the University of California at San Francisco, are uncomfortable with the imports of memantine and turn down patients' requests for help getting the drug.
''The question is, what makes kids different who watch TV for many hours as compared to those who watch little?'' Dr. Goodman said. ''You have to be extremely careful about making any causal inferences here,'' he said. '' It's too complex a phenomenon and things were measured too crudely.'' Correction:  March 30, 2002, Saturday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a study of television viewing and aggressive behavior stated the findings imprecisely. The increase in the likelihood of aggression by teenagers and young adults who watched television for more than seven hours a week was between 16 percent and 116 percent; the numbers represented a range, not a fall. Correction:  April 10, 2002, Wednesday  An article on Friday about a study linking television viewing by teenagers and young adults with criminal acts and aggressive behavior incompletely quoted a leader of the study, Dr. Jeffrey G. Johnson. He said, ''By decreasing exposure to media violence we may be able to prevent millions of Americans from being raped, murdered and robbed at gunpoint'' (not ''from being raped and murdered'').
Dr. Eisenstein, of Beth Israel Deaconess, said the medical center was uncomfortable with paying one family when others were donating their tissue. But, he said, there are no rules in this new arena, and the hospital might well have reached a different decision if a group of long-lived families had formed an organization like PX International. ''The bottom line is that none of us are smart enough to know where to begin,'' Dr. Eisenstein said. ''There is no easy answer. We're in the midst of a national debate.'' The Future  Searching for Fair Treatment of All Mr. Crohn and Mr. Fuchs, the men who are resistant to the AIDS virus, would like to press their claims. ''Somebody, somewhere, has to decide who owns our genetic material,'' Mr. Crohn said. But, the men said, it is beyond their means to take on this legal battle. They take comfort in the fact that two of the scientists they dealt with at Aaron Diamond, both of whom have since moved to other institutions, said they personally would be pleased if the two men could receive some compensation, assuming the patent ever makes money.
The year was 1988. The photo of the three calves was displayed in newspapers and featured in television news. The calves were clones, created from prize Brangus cattle, and made to be eaten in a new business that, the news reports promised, could forever alter the way superior bulls and cows were produced. Nary a word about whether it was safe to eat clones, nary a peep from the Food and Drug Administration. Scientists at two companies, the Granada Corporation and American Breeders Service, made and sold hundreds of cattle clones. Consumers bought their meat and ate it, unaware. Milk from clones was sold with no public outcry. In fact, said Dr. Mark Westhusin, a cloning expert at Texas A&amp;M, ''there may be some cows out there still, producing milk.'' These days, Granada and American Breeders are no longer in that cloning business. But cloning is back. And this time, the F.D.A. and consumer groups are involved, asking, Is it safe to eat a clone? Can you safely drink a clone's milk? If you breed a clone, can you eat its offspring?
Even if patients stop taking the drugs, they are not free of them. Bisphosphonates remain in bone for years, and no one knows how long the osteonecrosis risk remains. Some doctors and dentists suggest stopping the drugs for a few months before and after an invasive dental procedure. Others say six months to a year may be better. As for what happened to patients who developed the condition, oral surgeons say some got better but many did not. It now appears that the best treatment is with antibiotic rinses; cutting away the dead bone just made things worse. So little is known, said Dr. Bruce L. Pihlstrom, acting director of the division of clinical research at the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, that the most fundamental questions lack answers. The institute is starting studies, but for now ''we have to be careful that we're not too alarmist about this,'' Dr. Pihlstrom said. ''We just don't have the information we need.''
For now, the cancer institute, whose new director, Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, was sworn in on Tuesday, has not announced any plans to revisit the issue, raising the question of whether the institute will end up with conflicting information on its Web site, with one statement saying that the screening is beneficial and another saying that those benefits have not been proved. The institute's Web site, www.cancer.gov, says that women in their 40's and older should have the test and that it reduces the breast cancer death rate by as much as 30 percent. Members of the P.D.Q. board said they knew that it was not going to be easy for women and doctors to decide what to do. At the meeting, the members wrestled with the question of how much benefit, if any, mammograms confer. Some, like the board chairman, Donald A. Berry, chairman of the department of biostatistics at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said they thought it was unlikely that there were benefits that could make the test worthwhile.
In the meantime, several scientists said, they would like to read the Swedish results after they have been vetted by a reputable scientific journal. ''I look forward to the paper,'' Dr. Gold said.
About 40 percent of those assigned to surgery decided not to have it, often because their conditions improved while they awaited the operations. A third of patients assigned to wait decided to have operations, often because their pain was so bad that they could not endure it any longer. Others asked not to be assigned at random and were followed to see what treatment they chose and how they fared. The researchers are also conducting a separate analysis on the cost effectiveness of surgery compared with waiting. Although that analysis has not been published, Dr. Anna N. A. Tosteson of Dartmouth, an author of the study, said that Medicare paid a total of $5,425 for the operation and that private insurers might pay three to four times that. Although the results answered one question, about the safety of waiting, they were also, in a sense, disappointing, said Dr. David R. Flum, a contributing editor at The Journal of the American Medical Association and an associate professor of surgery at the University of Washington.
He said the episode showed that stem cell research and cloning to create human embryonic stem cells, ''is a hype balloon and it's been pricked.'' Not so, said the ethicist Arthur Caplan, an outspoken supporter of stem cell research. ''We know that in science, speed kills if you go fast, and that's what the South Koreans did,'' he said. ''It's also clear that they will do whatever it takes to right this ship. At the end of the day, critics of stem cell research will try to use this, but they won't get very far. People bending the rules in other countries doesn't reflect badly on us.'' The promise of cloned human embryonic stem cells remains, said Dr. George Daley, a stem cell researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston. ''The goal is still there and the medical value is still largely theoretical but no less than before.'' Dr. Cameron, however, said the political implications of the South Korean scandal are huge.
Some family members say they do not have the luxury of waiting. A St. Louis woman, who asked not to be identified because her husband, who has Alzheimer's disease, is a private person and would be mortified if he knew his condition was being publicly discussed, clings to the sweet moments when she sees glimpses of the man he once was. These days, he cannot carry on a conversation, he cannot take a shower by himself, he cannot always stand up, and he spends most of the day dozing. But, she said, the other day he removed a piece of the chocolate coating on an ice cream bar and put it aside for her, as he used to do before he became ill. ''This is for you,'' he told his wife. She got a prescription from her husband's doctor and has ordered memantine, hoping that it will give her more of those moments, and maybe even reverse the disease. ''If we would just get back to where we were a year ago,'' she said.
When, then, should you seek medical attention, and when should you wait for symptoms to go away on their own? The question makes many doctors nervous. They worry, said Dr. Russell Harris, an associate professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina, that some people may decide to ignore alarming symptoms, like those of a heart attack, with dire, even fatal consequences. With that caveat, however, some doctors have a few suggestions on when and how to stay away from their offices. ''The big causes of why people come to a doctor are most often conditions that are self-limited,'' Dr. Ramsey said. ''Upper respiratory infections, low back pain, simple strains and pain, sinusitis. In probably 80 percent of those visits there is not a lot we can offer.'' With most back pain, for example, there usually is no known cause and, studies have shown, no treatment that does any better than simply waiting it out. The exceptions are when the pain is unremitting or when a person's legs or feet become numb or weak, or they suddenly lose control of their bladder or bowels, which can be signs of tumors or infections. ''But those are very rare,'' Dr. Ramsey said.
The reward for living right, Graham promised, would be perfect health. A few decades later came Horace Fletcher, a wealthy American businessman who invented his diet in 1889. He was 40 and in despair: he was fat, his health was failing, he was always tired and he had indigestion. He felt, he said, like ''a thing fit but to be thrown on the scrap-heap.'' But Fletcher found a method that, he wrote, saved his life: eat only when you are hungry; eat only those foods that your appetite is craving; stop when you are no longer hungry and, the dictum for which he was most famous, chew every morsel of food until there is no more taste to be extracted from it. Fletcher became known as the Great Masticator, and his followers recited and followed his instructions to chew their food 100 times a minute. Liquids, too, had to be chewed, he insisted. He promised that ''Fletcherizing,'' as it became known, would turn ''a pitiable glutton into an intelligent epicurean.''
As an executive of EntreMed, a company that specializes in developing anti-angiogenesis drugs for the treatment of cancer, Dr. Holaday wondered whether P.S.A. could be such a compound. In laboratory experiments, his group looked at how P.S.A. affects endothelial cells -- the cells that form new blood vessels. The researchers also looked at how the protein affects cancerous tumors in mice. In both types of studies, P.S.A. acted like an angiogenesis inhibitor. Dr. Holaday said the finding might explain why a cancer of the prostate  tends to grow so slowly. ''It makes its own inhibitor,'' he said. That, Dr. Kramer said, is an intriguing notion. ''It has been an issue that many prostate cancers are so indolent and more people die with the disease than of it,'' he said. If the tumors are making their own anti-cancer drug, he added, ''this provides a potential explanation.'' On the other hand, Dr. Gerald Soff, an angiogenesis researcher at Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago, calculated that the levels of P.S.A. that Dr. Holaday and his colleagues had tested were at least 1,000 times those in the blood of men with prostate cancer. That means, Dr. Soff said, that ''the concentrations they're testing may be irrelevant'' to the course of disease.
Eventually, surgeons believe, most heart surgery will be done by robots whose arms are inserted through pencil-sized holes punched in patients' chests. Instead of directly peering into a patient's body, surgeons will view magnified images of the operation on computer screens. In theory, the doctor would not have to be in the same room, or even the same country, as the patient. Now, a doctor commonly makes a footlong incision in a patient's chest, saws the breastbone, breaks the ribs to make the holes bigger, then uses a heart-lung machine so the heart can be stopped, often at great risk, for repair. While doctors have already been operating through tiny holes in the abdomen to do gallbladder surgery or gynecological surgery, with what is known as laparoscopy, or in the knee, with arthroscopy, or in the chest, with thoracoscopy, these operations involve removing or working on large body structures. They do not involve microsurgery, which involves cutting and sewing minute blood vessels and other tissues.
''Many women see this as another way to give their child a head start in life,'' says Lori Andrews, a professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law who has studied the sperm bank industry, of the high stakes of sperm selection. And increasingly, say the banks, women want proof of perfection before buying a dream donor's sperm. They ask for SAT scores and personality test results. They want baby pictures, pictures of the donor as a teenager, and photos of him as an adult. They want to hear his voice on audio files and they want to read his answers to written questions. As more and more is added to the profile, its compilation becomes almost a striptease as the veil of anonymity falls away, eventually revealing all but name and address. The reason for offering clients previously unimaginable degrees of access to information is competition. ''It's kind of an arms race,'' explains William Jaeger, director of Fairfax Cryobank, in Fairfax, Va., which, along with California Cryobank, based in Los Angeles, is among the largest sperm banks in the country.
The indication that Floyd Landis might have taken testosterone to win the Tour de France gives rise to questions about how reliable the testing was and what, if anything, a cyclist would gain from using the hormone. Testosterone can have powerful effects on the body, directing it to make muscle instead of fat. And it can increase the red-blood cell count, which may allow more oxygen to reach laboring muscles. But when researchers have studied the hormone's effects on endurance, they have come up empty-handed. Dr. Shalender Bhasin, a leading testosterone researcher at Boston University Medical Center, said he was puzzled by his and others' inability to determine if the hormone affected endurance. In several experiments, scientists treated men with testosterone or placebos and then asked them to do such things as run on a treadmill until they were exhausted. The scientists saw no difference between the men who took testosterone and those who did not.
For example, Dr. Holmes said, human DNA is most diverse in Africa, supporting the idea that the human species originated on that continent. The second line of evidence was a plausible way for the virus to get from chimpanzees to humans. People in west-central Africa eat chimpanzees. It was entirely reasonable to think that an infected animal's blood gave the virus to a person who was handling the chimpanzee meat, infecting the person and setting the stage for an AIDS epidemic. ''People eat chimpanzees,'' Dr. Hahn said. ''We expect that transmissions occurred through the exposure to blood through hunting or preparation of meat.'' Finally, researchers were discovering AIDS-like viruses in other animals and other primates in Africa, but none were as closely related to H.I.V.-1 as the viruses in the three chimpanzees. The only species that fit all the evidence as the source of H.I.V.-1 was the chimpanzee, Dr. Holmes said.
A more important factor, Dr. Goldman said, is that treatment for heart attacks has changed radically. ''When I look back 25 years ago to when I was a cardiology fellow, many of the things we did were not proven and many are now proven to be wrong,'' Dr. Goldman said. ''Our treatment for heart attacks was bed rest. We put them to bed and we watched them.'' Now, doctors give drugs to heart attack patients to dissolve blood clots, opening blocked arteries. They operate, with much better surgical results. They pry open clogged blood vessels with balloon angioplasty and stents, the wire tubes to keep them open. Recently, device makers developed implantable defibrillators that can shock a fluttering heart into beating steadily, preventing death in patients with damaged hearts. ''Each of these represent major milestones,'' Dr. Braunwald said. Many experts worry that this cannot continue -- that the nation's obesity epidemic will reverse the trend. But Dr. Manolio, of the heart, lung and blood institute, said risk estimates that predict more cardiovascular disease among the obese were based on data from obese people of 20 to 30 years ago. It is unclear whether they apply today.
Joanne Wong's doctor correctly figured out what was wrong with her. But he would not tell her. Ms. Wong, a software engineer in Sunnyvale, Calif., was having abdominal pain and nausea. Her doctor told her to have a blood test, then ushered her out of his office, ignoring her when she asked what the test was for. ''The test came back, and he said I have a virus,'' Ms. Wong said. ''He said, 'Take this medicine for two weeks.' I asked, 'What kind of virus do I have? How did I get it?' But he just said, 'Take the medicine and come back in two weeks.' '' Two weeks later, she still felt ill. ''He said, 'You're fine, you're fine,' '' Ms. Wong said. ''I said, 'At least tell me the name of the virus.' '' But, she said, ''He just patted my shoulder and sent me out,'' telling her to return in three months for another blood test.
Dr. Zev Rosenwaks, who heads a large fertility center at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University, said that his patients, too, almost always keep their embryos. But, Dr. Rosenwaks said, over ''many many years,'' about 100 to 200 couples agreed to donate embryos for research. That could be enough for stem cell research, he said, although he is not doing such work. Boston I.V.F., a group of fertility clinics based in Waltham, Mass., recently agreed to supply Harvard researchers with frozen embryos for stem cell research. Dr. Michael Alper, the group's medical director, estimated that the clinics had several thousand frozen embryos and that a small percentage of patients had indicated they no longer needed theirs. Two months ago, Boston I.V.F. began asking these patients to donate their embryos. ''We've had several patients already who agreed,'' Dr. Alper said. In San Antonio, Dr. Pool does not offer patients the option of donating embryos for research. He stores about 2,000 frozen embryos, he said, and almost no one discards them.
In the six years since scientists in Scotland shocked the world with their announcement that they had cloned a sheep, scientists have cloned seven species and have even made clones of clones. Dolly the sheep is a grandmother, entering old age. And most scientists say they think humans, too, will be cloned. But cloning experts interviewed yesterday say they strongly doubt assertions made at a news conference that a 31-year-old woman has given birth to her own clone, a baby that is genetically identical to her. Clonaid, a company associated with a group that believes that space travelers created the human race by cloning, said yesterday that its scientists had created the clone but offered no proof, would not say who had done the work or describe their methods. ''I would be really really surprised if it stands,'' said Dr. Tanja Dominko, a cloning expert who is chief science officer at Cellthera, a newly formed company in Southbridge, Mass. ''I don't believe it for a minute.''
On the other hand, he said, he knows of people who have sickened and died from drinking too much. Hyponatremia can be treated, Dr. Noakes said. A small volume of a highly concentrated salt solution is given intravenously and can save a patient's life by pulling water out of swollen brain cells. But, he said, doctors and emergency workers often assume that the problem is dehydration and give intravenous fluids, sometimes killing the patient. He and others advise testing the salt concentration of the athlete's blood before treatment. For their part, runners can estimate how much they should drink by weighing themselves before and after long training runs to see how much they lose -- and thus how much water they should replace. But they can also follow what Dr. Paul D. Thompson calls ''a rough rule of thumb.'' Dr. Thompson, a cardiologist at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut and a marathon runner, advises runners to drink while they are moving.
''You feel like no one really understands,'' she said. ''They say: 'Everyone forgets. There's nothing wrong with you.' You just want to go: 'But you don't understand. It's not that kind of thing.' '' In a telephone interview, Ms. Hoard explained that conversations could be difficult and asked if she could send the interviewer a letter about her experiences. ''Just when you want to assert yourself and have some good confident 'self-talk' going,'' she wrote, ''you 'forget' some important detail or realize you've asked your spouse or friend the same question three or four times and they are tired of giving the answer over and over! You want to hide away somewhere and just cry sometimes.'' She feels she is in no man's land. ''You are not the confident, competent person you once were, but neither are you debilitated. Knowledgeable professionals begin to bypass you and give pertinent information and eye contact to your caregiver.''
Heart disease experts had complained that the study would not show any difference because it had only half the number of patients they thought would be needed and, at two years, followed them for only half the length of time. ''A lot of people believed that lower is better,'' observed Dr. Daniel Rader, director of preventive cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. ''But no one thought that this would be the study to prove it. It was designed to prove the opposite.'' Dr. Nissen, of the Cleveland Clinic, said that drug companies ''never, ever sponsor a trial like this that they think has a chance of going the wrong way.'' ''This trial backfired,'' he added, ''because in fact the differences between these two drugs are very profound.'' The study's outcome is yet another piece of bad news for Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is reeling from an accounting scandal and an aging lineup of drugs. Pravachol had $2.8 billion in sales last year, making it the company's biggest-selling drug. But it has been losing market share among statins for years, and now gets just 9 percent of new prescriptions. This study, as well as competition from AstraZeneca's new, powerful pill, Crestor, will most likely accelerate that downward trend.
The scientists painstakingly traced the genetic sequence, synthesized the virus using tools of molecular biology, and infected mice and human lung cells with it in a secure laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The research is being published in the journals Nature and Science. The findings, the scientists say, reveal a small number of genetic changes that may explain why this virus was so lethal. It is significantly different from flu viruses that caused the more recent pandemics of 1957 and 1968. Those viruses were not bird flu viruses but instead were human flu viruses that picked up a few genetic elements of bird flu. The research also confirms the legitimacy of worries about the bird flu viruses, called H5N1, that are emerging in Asia. Since 1997, bird flocks in 11 countries have been decimated by flu outbreaks. So far nearly all the people infected -- more than 100, including more than 60 who died -- contracted the sickness directly from birds. However, there has been little transmission between people.
''It looks like a piece of ivory with little tiny holes in it,'' Dr. Ruggiero said. ''The one drug they were all on was bisphosphonates.'' He tried scraping away the dead bone and letting it heal, but the condition only worsened. ''We were creating a larger bone wound that didn't heal,'' Dr. Ruggiero said. He called local cancer specialists, but ''they said they did not have any experience with this kind of complication.'' He contacted Novartis, which makes Zometa and Aredia, the intravenous drugs. ''They had no record of the problem,'' he said. Dr. John A. Hohneker, vice president for oncology medical affairs and services at Novartis, said the company got its first patient report in December 2002. ''We did a literature search looking for osteonecrosis of the jaw,'' Dr. Hohneker said. ''There are a lot of unknowns there. There really isn't even a consistent definition of what osteonecrosis of the jaw is, and the true incidence is unknown.''
In the meantime, it has been an intense four years running PXE International, Ms. Terry said. ''I volunteer for the organization about 90 hours a week,'' she said. Her husband, she adds, spends all of his free time working for the group. ''We don't do much else,'' Ms. Terry said. ''As my husband says, we don't do the laundry much.''
''It's the lying that really gets to me,'' Dr. Pope said. ''I'll give a lecture and show a photograph of some huge bodybuilder and someone will say, 'Do you think he took steroids?' I'll say, 'Do you think World War II really happened?' '' But scientists say their ignorance about the array of anabolic drugs and their effects remains huge. Some of the drugs can lower levels of HDL cholesterol, the type that normally protects against heart disease. A lower HDL level may lead to an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. They may fuel the growth of some cancers, particularly those of the prostate. They suppress the body's own sex hormone production, which can cause infertility in people who are taking the drugs. But no one has done a long-term study of people who took huge doses of anabolic drugs, and for the most part, no one knows what medical problems the drugs may cause or how likely they are.
Dr. Wilt noted that in the recent Swedish study of prostate cancer, a committee reviewed all deaths that occurred. Initially, they agreed on the causes of death for 85 percent of the 115 men who died in the course of the study, eventually reaching 100 percent agreement. ''That's in a highly controlled setting where they are spending time and money to be as rigorous as possible,'' Dr. Wilt said, adding that most studies did not reach that level of rigor. ''If they had misclassified just three or four deaths, there would have been no difference in the death rate from prostate cancer.'' The rules for deciding what counts as a cancer death are rarely spelled out, said Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of the V.A. Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt. ''We are not all clear on what constitutes a cancer death,'' he said. Often, Dr. Goodman said, the decision to accept a reduction in the death rate from a particular disease rather than a reduction in the overall death rate comes down to money and resources. ''Usually, the number of people you need to study the disease-specific effect is much smaller than the number you need to look at the overall effects,'' he said. ''A lot of people would say, 'Wait a minute, if I can show I can decrease prostate cancer mortality with 3,000 people, why do I have to go out and get 12,000 people to show the other?' Often, they don't have the choice. They don't have the money.''
Nor did the shift in prescriptions simply delay the onset of endometrial cancers. ''They never showed up at all,'' Dr. Kramer said. It is not yet certain whether estrogen alone raises the breast cancer risk. The Women's Health Initiative did not find such a link, but other studies found a very small risk. Barbara Balaban, 77, of Somers, N.Y., said she was furious when she read the news Friday about the fall in breast cancer rates. Not so long ago, she said, doctors were all too eager to put every woman on the drugs, starting at menopause and continuing indefinitely. ''Going through menopause was not an illness,'' she said. ''There was no reason to take it, but they told me I should. They said it would be so wonderful. My gynecologist, my internist, my endocrinologist, they were all pushing it.'' At one point, she said, a doctor finally wore her down and she ended up taking the drugs for a year.
But they worried that there might be so few such studies with a treated, untreated and placebo group that they would never be able to answer the question. ''We thought if we could find 20, that would be a huge success,'' Dr. Hrobjartsson said. To their surprise, they found 114, published between 1946 and 1998. The conditions included medical disorders, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and asthma; behavioral disorders and addictions, like alcohol abuse and smoking; neurological diseases like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and epilepsy, and  infections, like bacterial infections and the common cold. When they analyzed the data, they could detect no effects of placebos on objective measurements, like cholesterol levels or blood pressure. Dr. John C. Bailar III, an emeritus professor at the University of Chicago who wrote an editorial accompanying the placebo paper, said the findings called into question some mind-body beliefs. These are arguments that use the placebo effect to conclude that the mind can so profoundly affect the course of a disease that people should be able to harness this power and think themselves well.
In New York, for example, people absorb about 100 millirem of radiation each year from cosmic rays alone, said Dr. John Boice Jr., a radiation expert, who is the scientific director of the International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Md. In Denver, exposure from cosmic rays averages 200 millirem a year, he said, and natural variation in radiation exposure is many times the amounts of radiation that are being disputed by regulatory agencies. ''We eat, breathe and drink low levels of radiation,'' Dr. Boice said. At the same time, said Dr. Fred Mettler, chairman of the radiology department at the University of New Mexico medical school, major medical sources of radiation, like CAT scanners, have fallen outside the purview of any regulatory agency. ''A whole lot of places aren't regulated at all,'' Dr. Mettler said. ''It's a bit of a nightmare.'' ''When you look at the exposure of the population from radiation, about two-thirds is due to natural background and about 15 percent is due to your friendly doctors and chiropractors,'' Dr. Mettler said. ''Everything else is, to tell you the truth, very minimal. Less than a couple of percent is from all the nuclear reactors and all the research industry.''
The company is pinning its hopes on a gene that is turned on with very low-calorie diets. This gene's activity, Dr. Guarente said, is the reason such a diet, if someone could stand it, might prolong life. The company's aim is to find a drug that will turn up the activity of the gene, SIRT1, giving the effect of a diet without having to be on one. But then what? One idea might be to use so-called surrogate markers, indirect indicators that aging is slowed. Drug companies do that with other conditions, demonstrating, for example, that a drug lowers blood pressure or cholesterol levels, which are surrogates for reducing the risk of heart disease. But what is a surrogate marker for aging? ''You have to figure out: Are there parameters to aging other than the length of time you live?'' says Dr. Ronald W. Hansen, an expert on the drug industry at the University of Rochester's Simon Graduate School of Business. Then, he adds, you need a way of measuring them.
To protect patients' privacy, Dr. Roses said, their names and identifying features are not stored with their DNA. Glaxo Wellcome plans to enter the pharmacogenetics market with a drug that is already on the market, offering patients a SNP test before they take the drug to see if they are likely to respond. Then the company plans to move on and use the SNP profiles as part of drug development. In a few years, drug company executives predict, SNP tests will be available for several drugs and several diseases. Eventually, most drugs will be sold with a SNP test, companies say. Companies expect to use a ''SNP chip'' for testing. It is a device that can be used to scan a sample of DNA for specific genetic sequences or anomalies. In the future, drug company executives predict, SNP research will reward them with hundreds of new drugs, including many that will be unlike any on the market today. With that in mind, Dr. Sigal said, his company has a new business goal. Rather than settling for the current pattern of one entirely new drug on the market each year, the company aims to have three.
''My mom used to cook all her meats with oil,'' 10-year-old Edgar Sandoval said. ''Now she bought a grill. She grills them now.'' Mrs. Rodriguez said: ''My children, I don't have to be saying, 'Don't eat more ice cream.' They don't want to eat more ice cream. They don't want red lights.'' It was too soon -- five weeks into the six-month program -- to talk about weight loss, since the plan is  designed to steer children toward healthy eating rather than providing a quick fix. But some children said with pride that they had already dropped a few pounds and the families clearly expected great success. Dr. Thomas Robinson, an assistant professor of pediatrics and medicine at Stanford University, was more circumspect, hoping instead that he could gather enough promising data from this pilot program to get grants to extend it, adding more families, and determining whether it could  make a difference in the long run.
''You have to come up with new ways of selling stuff,'' Professor Haiken said. '' 'Feed your skin.' That sort of stuff. For a generation that is pretty much obsessed with health, that is what sells.'' It's an illusion, of course. And, in particular, the vitamins, minerals and herbs that are suffusing beauty products these days do nothing for the health of the skin, said Dr. Albert M. Kligman, a professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia. ''Let's say you have a good cream, so you add a little vitamin A,'' Dr. Kligman said. ''Then you add vitamin B, then you add C and D and E. Now suppose you want to add a little selenium and a little copper, and suppose you want to add an antioxidant. Now we have a cocktail. I know a product that has 67 active ingredients.'' He worries about the long-term effects of using an untested mix of chemicals on the skin and the lack of regulation of the cosmetics industry.
''Every cat was infected with a virus that had the potential to kill the immune system,'' Dr. O'Brien said. But, somehow, those animals were not even ill. ''We spent a lot of time looking for a disease, but no one could find it,'' Dr. O'Brien said. It seemed that wild cats had somehow learned to live with the virus and not get sick. But domestic cats, which were new victims for the virus, were defenseless and quickly succumbed. Meanwhile, others were discovering the same pattern in primates, looking in the wild at monkeys that were not endangered, even kept as pets, and also examining captive animals. At least 20 species of African primates are infected with, but seemingly unaffected by, AIDS-like viruses. Asian monkeys, in contrast, were not infected. But when Asian monkeys in research laboratories were given the African monkey viruses -- either deliberately by researchers who were studying the viruses or accidentally because they were in cages with African monkeys -- the Asian monkeys contracted a disease that looked like AIDS.
Jay Weinstein found out that he had chronic myelogenous leukemia in 1996, two weeks before his marriage. He was 36 years old, a New York City firefighter, and he thought his health was great. He learned that there was little hope for a cure. The one treatment that could save him was a bone marrow transplant, but that required a donor, and he did not have one. By 1999, his disease was nearing its final, fatal phase. He might have just weeks to live. Then, Mr. Weinstein had a stroke of luck. He managed to become one of the last patients to enroll in a preliminary study at the Oregon Health &amp; Science University, testing an experimental drug. Mr. Weinstein is alive today and still taking the drug, now on the market as Gleevec. Its maker, Novartis, supplies it to him free because he participated in the clinical trial. Dr. Brian Druker, a Howard Hughes investigator at the university's Cancer Institute, who led the Gleevec study, sees Mr. Weinstein as a pioneer in a new frontier of science. His treatment was based not on blasting cancer cells with harsh chemotherapy or radiation but instead on using a sort of molecular razor to cut them out.
Now, he said, at least some might start asking how to weigh the evidence of the benefits and the risks.
Then the interviewers asked the women if they had anything to add. Repeatedly, the women with cancer would turn to their interviewers and say, ''Why didn't you ask me about what really caused my cancer?'' What really caused it, they would say, was stress. It was plausible, Dr. Newcomb reasoned. After all, stress could alter the functioning of the immune system, in turn altering susceptibility to cancer. So Dr. Newcomb incorporated standard questions about stressful life events into her continuing study of nearly 1,000 women. Had family members or friends died? Had they gotten married or divorced? Had they lost a job or had they retired? Had their financial status changed? Were there stressful events not on the list that they would like to add? The women did not know why the questions, incorporated as part of a longer interview, were being asked. And the interviewers did not know which women had had cancer.
For now, she added, ''we really can't answer that question.''
Researchers have worked with mouse embryonic stem cells for years, but only recently have scientists been able to isolate human embryonic stem cells, a result with profound implications. Scientists speak of learning to push human embryonic stem cells along a path to become a spongy bone marrow, brimming with blood cells, or a pancreas that could squirt out insulin for a person with diabetes or a fresh layer of skin for a burn patient. There is just one problem: The Federal Government bans the use of its money for research in which human embryos are destroyed or discarded. The question was, where did that leave embryo stem cells? In a recent decision, lawyers for the Department of Health and Human Services wrote that human embryonic stem cells were not included in the research ban. The reason was that the cells ''are not an embryo as defined by statute'' and that because human embryonic stem cells ''do not have the capacity to develop into a human being, they cannot be considered human embryos consistent with the commonly accepted or scientific meaning of that term.''
''It had bars on the window. I had to show a picture ID to get in,'' Mrs. Schaefer recalled. ''I walked into this little waiting room and there were probably 30 women sitting there crying quietly. There was not a soul over the age of 25.'' It turned out that the doctor ran an abortion clinic. ''If I ever had any doubts about why I was doing this, that did it for me,'' Mrs. Schaefer said. ''If I could prevent anyone from being in that room, that would be my goal.''
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Lance Armstrong Foundation recently issued a report on cancer survivors, and two more national reports on the topic will be issued this week. Now, questions that were rarely asked in the past are receiving intense attention. ''This is a new field for us,'' said Kevin Brady, acting director of the division of cancer prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control. But, he said, the need for answers is pressing. ''We heard from constituents, from survivors,'' he said. ''They were saying, 'There's a lot we don't understand. Now that we know people are living longer, what are the other impacts as we survive, as we age?''' They are, of course, impossible to categorize, the nearly 10 million Americans who have had cancer diagnoses. Some have tumors -- in the lung or pancreas, for example -- that defy treatment. Others, like men with prostate cancer, usually have no symptoms of cancer and no recurrences after they are treated, but the treatments themselves, radiation or surgery, can render them impotent or incontinent.
Dr. Donald A. Redelmeier, a professor of medicine at the University of Toronto who wrote an accompanying editorial, said the higher death rate on weekends ''has everything to do with staffing in hospitals.'' It can mean, Dr. Redelmeier said, that not enough expert medical staff members are available on weekends for prompt and aggressive treatment. ''It's not just that there are fewer people around, but those who are around are often spread thinner,'' he added. ''And there is a shift in seniority, as well. The most skilled and savvy people don't work weekends.'' Dr. Kostis said the correlation between more deaths and less angioplasty on weekends was significant. ''One out of every 100 who died,'' he said, ''died potentially unnecessarily.'' He and others emphasize, however, that people having heart attacks remain much better off going to hospitals on a weekend than waiting until Monday morning. Although some investigators said the findings gave them pause, not everyone was convinced that there was a cause-and-effect relationship between lower angioplasty rates and higher death rates.
Dr. Puskas has the same philosophy. He did 300 bypass operations last year, he said, and 95 percent of them were off-pump. So far, he said, studies have been equivocal on whether off-pump surgery protects patients' brains, but they also have been too small to see anything but blockbuster differences. Smaller effects may not show up, though they may be extremely important to individual patients. Dr. Puskas did find, however, that off-pump surgery costs less and results in fewer blood transfusion and less injury to the heart as measured by blood enzyme levels. Patients also leave hospitals about a day earlier, he has found. ''The heart-lung machine has no particular benefit to the patient,'' Dr. Puskas said. ''It serves the surgeon, not the patient.'' But off-pump surgery is difficult, and some surgeons just never developed the skill. ''You can view this as a conflict between the younger, more aggressive surgeons versus the older, more conservative ones,'' said Dr. Daniel Mark, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at Duke University. ''Until recently, once you learned how to do bypass surgery, you pretty much knew how to do it. Now these guys have to learn something that's really kind of challenging. You can think of it as innovation versus staying with the old procedure that we know and love and have used for 30 years.''
But this study, he said, was the first evidence that those who used the test every one to two years could avoid colon cancer in the first place. Dr. Hawk said people whose colon cancer was detected in its earliest stage had a five-year survival rate of 90 percent while those whose cancer was found in the latest stage, stage D, had an 8 percent survival rate. ''It's like the ultimate stage shift,'' Dr. Hawk said of the new results. ''Not only do you not get stage D cancer, you don't get cancer at all.'' Colon cancer, which kills 65,000 Americans a year, is the leading cause of cancer deaths for men and women, after lung cancer. Besides the fecal test, doctors detect it using colonoscopies, in which a flexible scope is used to examine the entire colon, and sigmoidoscopies, in which a scope is used to examine the lower part of the colon, where most cancers occur. Some doctors also look for cancers with barium enemas.
SOCIETY runs on numbers: the number of people residing in the United States, the number of people in Florida who voted for each of the presidential candidates, the number of unemployed, the percent chance of a crippling blizzard. Those who come up with these all-important digits know they aren't perfect, even if it sometimes comes as a surprise to the public. And some diehard believers in progress cling to the hope that technology will fix our numbers problem. But some numbers just can't be fixed. In some cases, the expectation of endless improvement has faltered before the Law of Unintended Consequences. What looks like a slick solution to a technical problem can introduce new problems, sometimes just as bad as the original ones. Instead of getting a better number, the result is a different number, with its own inaccuracies. The census is a case in point. The Census Bureau's own estimates show that 3.3 million Americans were missed in its count for 2000. So why not use science -- statistical adjustments -- to put them back in?
''We think that these transmissions have gone on forever and a day, for all the centuries that people hunted chimpanzees,'' Dr. Hahn said. ''The rule is that these transmissions go nowhere. They just peter out, unless you have additional factors that promote subsequent spread in the new human host.'' One possible explanation for the extensive spread of H.I.V.-1, several scientists said, was that people began congregating in cities in Africa. There, the conditions were ripe for an AIDS epidemic. ''If you look at the population of Kinshasa, it's an exponential curve going up,'' Dr. Sharp said. ''During the 20th century, you have far more movement of people into urban areas and perhaps changes in behavior.'' In addition, doctors in clinics in Africa commonly reused needles without sterilizing them between patients, a practice that, he said,  ''would have played a role in getting the virus kick-started.'' Another possible explanation is less comforting.
Half of all recurrences happen five or more years after a woman is first diagnosed, and women face a 2 to 4 percent chance each year that their cancer might return. The new study found that if women take a different drug, letrozole, sold by Novartis under the brand name Femara, after their five years of tamoxifen, they can cut that yearly risk nearly in half. An average of 2.4 years after their tamoxifen treatment ended, 132 women who were taking placebos developed new breast cancer or recurrences of their original cancer, compared with 75 of the women taking letrozole, a 43 percent reduction. ''Up until now, tamoxifen has been one of the most effective drugs in the treatment of breast cancer, or almost any cancer,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Abrams, the associate chief of the clinical investigations branch of the National Cancer Institute. ''But we lacked a treatment that could be used after tamoxifen. That's why this study is so important.''
Two professional societies representing endocrinologists have issued a statement saying that despite the conclusion of a widely noted study, it is not yet established that girls typically enter puberty earlier today. The groups urged that girls who appear to be starting sexual development at a young age see a specialist as soon as possible. The organizations, the Endocrine Society and the Lawson-Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, also urged that rigorous studies be undertaken to determine not just the average age when puberty begins but how quickly it progresses. They questioned the study concluding that puberty was starting earlier, saying that doctors and nurses who had evaluated girls might have mistaken fat tissue in chubby girls for breasts and that the girls in the study had not been randomly selected. And, they said, the age of girls at the one incontrovertible sign of puberty -- first menstruation -- has been the same for decades.
But that was 1961, a time when most men were uninterested in growing big muscles. ''I was almost embarrassed to be lifting weights,'' Mr. Fair said. Coaches told athletes that if they lifted, they would become slow and musclebound, or develop hernias and knee injuries. But no one, except a few elite weight lifters, had even thought of using steroids, and those who did were doing it surreptitiously. Anabolic steroids came to weight lifting in the 1950's, when Russians began taking testosterone and winning championships, Mr. Fair said. By 1960, a few American weight lifters had begun secretly taking them too. Within a few years, most elite weight lifters were using the drugs, said Terry Todd, a former champion weight lifter who is now a historian of weight lifting at the University of Texas at Austin. By the end of the decade, other elite athletes had discovered the drugs. In 1969, the marathon champion Frank Shorter says, he watched a French hammer thrower, George Frenn, who died at an early age, inject a steroid into his leg.
For all the handwringing by scientists, you might think that therapeutic cloning is on the verge of curing a disease or two. But that is not the case. Therein lies a familiar problem for scientists -- that of treading the fine line between touting the promise of the work, at least enough to gain public support and money, and being honest enough about the hurdles that lie ahead. Despite optimistic statements about curing diseases, almost all researchers, when questioned, confess that such accomplishments are more dream than reality. Someday, if therapeutic cloning goes well, scientists would take a few cells from a person with a disease, say diabetes, and use them to make an embryo that would have the same genes as the sick person. Implanting that embryo in a woman might enable it to grow into a baby who is a clone of the sick person. Instead, the embryo would grow in the laboratory for about five days to the blastocyst stage, the point at which the embryo has two distinct cell types. It consists of a hollow ball with another ball of cells inside, known as embryonic stem cells. They, in theory, could develop into any of the body's specialized cells. The other embryo cells would be discarded.
So Dr. Blair and his colleagues decided to try for the greatest possible rigor by focusing on one group, farmers, that is not only routinely exposed to pesticides that may increase cancer risk, but also keeps excellent records of exposure. The effort, a collaboration involving the cancer institute, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the Environmental Protection Agency, began in 1993 and includes nearly every farmer and farmer's spouse in Iowa and North Carolina -- 55,000 farmers and 35,000 spouses. Investigators have been asking the farmers what pesticides and herbicides they used, when they used them and how much they used, and have been obtaining information on other risk factors like smoking. Then they use the medical records from tumor registries to determine who developed cancer and what type was developed. ''We're now just in the period of time where we can look at outcomes,'' Dr. Blair said. So far, the researchers have found a few associations, but nothing that is definitive.
In a statement the medical association warns, ''The A.M.A. is greatly concerned that a substantial proportion of information on the Internet might be inaccurate, erroneous, misleading or fraudulent and thereby pose a threat to public health.'' Nonetheless, Dr. Reardon said, doctors are going to have to adjust. ''I think this is the wave of the future,'' he said. Web sites include those sponsored by responsible groups like the National Institutes of Health and the American Heart Association as well as ones run by purveyors of herbs and supplements or of unproven treatments like coffee enemas for cancer. They include sites put up by hospitals looking for business and by individual doctors, some of whom provide links to articles in medical journals and others who say they have secret cures. They also include  countless chat rooms for patients, their families and the worried. More sites are added each day, like one to be available soon to be run by a company formed by the American Medical Association and six doctors associations.
He and other cancer experts were elated. Though many questions remain about how to advise individual women, they think the results will have an impact. Letrozole is already on the market, approved for the treatment of cancer, and so it is available immediately. ''This is up with the biggies, it is up with the major majors,'' Dr. Norton said. Dr. C. Kent Osborne, director of the breast center at Baylor College of Medicine and the Methodist Hospital in Houston, said: ''I think it's exciting.'' Letrozole is not, of course, a cure, said Dr. Osborne, who was not part of the study. But, he added, ''we keep chipping away at breast cancer and the cumulative effect is a marked reduction in mortality rates, which we've seen.'' Now, Dr. Osborne said, ''I think they are going to continue to go down.'' The study was supposed to follow the women for five years after they had finished with tamoxifen, to see whether letrozole was better than a placebo during that period. But when an independent committee peeked at the results early, it called for an immediate halt to the study.
A year ago, I got a bicycle that changed my life. The sort of bicycling that attracts me is nothing like those leisurely rides through the countryside, a soft breeze in your face, stopping to picnic or explore a stream along the way. Instead, it is about riding fast on a bicycle with a hard narrow seat, leaning forward or standing for a burst of power. It is about wearing special shoes that snap onto your pedals so you can pull up as well as push down, and feeling the thrill and the rush of real physical exertion. Not all that long ago, my passion put me in a tiny minority of people who took to the road for exercise rather than leisure. But the ranks of serious bicyclists are increasing. The sales of specialty road bicycles, the sort sold in bike shops, increased to 185,400 in 2003 from 171,600 in 2002, according to the Bicycle Product Suppliers Association, and a double-digit increase in sales is expected this year.
The next thing Mr. Orr knew, he was being rushed to the cardiac catheterization laboratory for a procedure to open his artery. ''They said: 'We're going now. We're going now,' '' Mr. Orr recalled. ''That really scared me. Someone kept yelling: 'Do you have his labs? Do you have his labs?' Someone else said, 'We'll transfer them later.' '' The electrocardiogram was at 3:45 p.m., roughly 30 minutes after his symptoms changed from intermittent to constant and 5 minutes after he got to the hospital. At 3:52 p.m., Dr. Ashvin Pande, a cardiology fellow, was chatting in the hallway when he was called to the catheterization lab. ''Big M.I. coming in,'' a nurse told Dr. Pande, using the abbreviation for myocardial infarction, or heart attack. At the time, the room was occupied -- a patient was lying on the table for an elective procedure. He was quickly wheeled out and Mr. Orr was wheeled in. It was 3:56 p.m.
Other common medical conditions have not been systematically studied, but Dr. Lindenauer said he would not be surprised if the same held true -- community hospitals will be at least as good as major medical centers for ordinary illnesses. ''A colleague of mine drew an analogy to driving and the idea that you just need to be a good enough driver to avoid accidents,'' he said. Beyond that, he said, ''we don't really differentiate that much between great and good enough.'' The situation is different for more-complex matters like heart surgery and cancer care, researchers say. In such cases, where you go can matter -- a lot, depending on the condition. ''Not that I want to oversimplify to this degree, but for cardiovascular care, pick a very busy, high-volume surgeon,'' said Dr. John D. Birkmeyer, a professor of surgery at the University of Michigan who has analyzed Medicare data. ''For cancer care, focus on the hospital.''
The Institute of Medicine committee estimated that about 1.5 million to 1.8 million American women have had silicone breast implants, about 70 percent for breast enlargement and the rest as reconstruction after mastectomy. Members of the committee, headed by Dr. Stuart Bondurant, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and Dr. Virginia Ernster, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California at San Francisco, were prohibited from discussing the report until it was officially made public. Sybil Goldrich, founder of Command Trust Network, an information clearinghouse for women with silicone problems, said, ''I find it extremely difficult to accept what the Institute of Medicine says because those studies are paid for by the manufacturers. They have not convinced me that their review is correct. It is as simple as that.'' Tommy Jacks, a lawyer in Austin, Tex., whose firm has represented 425 women with implants, said he doubts that the report will be the last word on the matter. ''This report is simply a review of the literature by a committee that's reached some conclusion,'' he said. ''It is premature to conclude that reports like this are the last word that scientists and physicians will have about the safety of breast implants,'' he said.
What has emerged is a tenuous connection between stress, the immune system and cancer, with a surprising new insight that is changing the direction of research: it now appears that cancer cells make proteins that actually tell the immune system to let them alone and even to help them grow. As for whether stress causes cancer, the question is still open. ''I have no idea, and nobody else does, either,'' said Barbara Andersen, a psychology professor at Ohio State University who studies stress reduction in cancer patients. ''If somebody suggested that they know, I would question them.'' Polly Newcomb, the head of the cancer prevention program at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, decided to ask whether stress caused breast cancer, because women seemed convinced that it did. The issue came up in her epidemiologic studies of what might be causing cancer. She used trained interviewers to ask women with cancer and healthy women who served as controls about their medical histories, their environments and the medicines they were taking.
But Dr. Williamson, who wrote an editorial accompanying the orlistat article, asked whether the drug was needed. He worried about its safety when ''tens of thousands or even millions of people start taking this drug.'' The company's studies, he added, were not designed to look at breast cancer risk and he, for one, was not satisfied that the question had been answered. ''The risk-benefit ratio for this drug is incomplete,'' Dr. Williamson said. ''We usually don't like to buy things if we don't know what they will deliver, and we don't know what this drug will deliver.'' And, he added, ''someone has to pay for these drugs.'' Drug companies ordinarily announce a drug's price when it is approved for marketing, and Hoffmann-La Roche has not said what orlistat would cost in the United States. But Valerie Suga, a company spokeswoman, said that orlistat, which was approved for sale in most of Europe at the end of July, costs about $116 a month there.
''Right now, the biology of a human cancer cell is a black box,'' Dr. Weinberg said. Tumor cells from patients are so deranged and vary so much from patient to patient that it is hard for scientists to understand which genetic changes are important. When simply looking at the end product, a cancer cell, it is all but impossible to untangle the genetic steps that made it that way. But by working with cancer cells whose genetic changes are well defined, scientists can start to ask questions about genes they find in tumors that they remove from patients, allowing them to add genes and take them away to learn what the genes do. ''We can ask, 'What are the rules?' '' Dr. Weinberg said. ''Our dream in the end is to come up with therapies that are specific for cancer cells,'' said Dr. William C. Hahn, the first author of the paper being published today and a post-doctoral student in Dr. Weinberg's laboratory.
In addition, said Dr. Lawrence F. Marshall, professor and chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the University of California at San Diego, while chilling the brain can shut down deleterious biochemical reactions resulting from brain injury, doctors did not know whether  those reactions would start up again as soon as the patient was warmed to a normal temperature. Only a large and rigorous study could answer the questions. But because brain damage occurs in a rapid cascade of biochemical reactions that can kill or permanently disable delicate cells, doctors would have to initiate treatment at once, often without waiting for family members to consent to it. In fact, Dr. Clifton, professor and chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the University of Texas-Houston Medical School, organized researchers from 11 medical centers for this study in 1993 but nearly abandoned the effort a year later over the permission issue. Obtaining consent  ''was a nightmare,'' Dr. Clifton said in an interview this week.
Dr. Longini, Dr. Halloran and their colleagues recently employed a mathematical model to estimate what might happen if 60 percent of American children and adolescents got flu shots. They found that flu deaths in people aged 65 and older could fall to 6,600 a year from 34,000. Hospitalizations could drop to 8,000 a year from 43,000. And the annual cost of caring for older people who get the flu could be cut from today's $473 million to just $90 million. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, also liked the idea of immunizing schoolchildren, as long as older adults and others at increased risk from flu also get the shots. ''There's no doubt that it has considerable merit,'' he said. Of course, it would be nice to know for sure that giving flu shots to children would stanch an epidemic. Dr. Halloran, for one, would like to see a national study, giving the vaccine to children in some places but not others and seeing what happens.
''The more you prepare for one kind of surprise, the more they are likely to come in an area you're not prepared for,'' said a senior government official with knowledge of the situation. Anthrax was on everyone's list of possible agents for a terrorist attack, but the situations people imagined tended to involve large-scale attacks, with clouds of spores dropped on a city or a football stadium and with hundreds or thousands of people getting sick at once. Those attacks are considered hard to pull off. The spores have to be finely ground so they can get into people's lungs and treated so they will not clump together, but then they can easily be dispersed by the wind and killed by the sun. No one expected that terrorists would send expertly processed anthrax spores through the mail. Nor did experts anticipate that the spores would burst out of letters and infect postal workers.
Proof
Another problem is deciding whether a patient is really having a stroke. A person who has trouble forming words could just be confused. Or what about someone whose arm or leg is weak? ''A lot of things can cause weakness,'' Dr. Warach said. ''A nerve injury can cause weakness; sometimes brain tumors can be suddenly symptomatic. Sometimes people have migraines that can completely mimic a stroke.'' In fact, he said, a quarter of emergency room patients with symptoms suggestive of a stroke are not actually having one. Most get CT scans, which are useful mostly to rule out hemorrhagic strokes, the less common type that is caused by bleeding in the brain and should not be treated with tPA. Stroke specialists can usually then decide whether the patient is having a stroke caused by a blocked blood vessel and whether it can be treated with tPA. But most stroke patients are handled by emergency room physicians who often say they are not sure of the diagnosis and therefore hesitate to give tPA.
''At my age, you adjust to things,'' he said. But in Princeton, Dr. Dultz's patient, Ms. Buchanan, is just as devoted to her and to the hospital there. Dr. Dultz said she encouraged her patients to seek second opinions, but only half do, and nearly all decide to stay at the Princeton hospital. As a result, Dr. Dultz said, she ends up operating on about 200 women a year, which puts her and the hospital into the high-volume category. Those who leave for major medical centers tell her they were persuaded by other family members, she added. A small hospital offers more than the mechanics of medicine, Dr. Dultz said. She tries to always be there for her patients, giving out her home phone number and her cellphone number, meeting patients in the emergency room, going into her office to see patients early in the morning or after her staff has left for the day.
Until now, the agency's position has been that it decides what companies can say and how they can say it. Its mission of protecting the public health, the agency argued, gives it broad authority to regulate commercial speech. But Mr. Troy says recent court rulings have given the agency pause. On April 29, the Supreme Court bluntly informed the agency that it was being overly paternalistic. The question before the court was whether pharmacies that made specialized mixtures of prescription drugs could advertise or promote their products. Mr. Troy, arguing for the F.D.A., said that if pharmacies were allowed to do so they would essentially be selling prescription drugs without demonstrating safety and efficacy. ''Why spend the millions of dollars to come through our approval process?'' Mr. Troy asked. ''It's our fundamental power to approve drugs before they come on the market.'' But the Supreme Court said that restricting free speech should be a last resort, writing, ''We have previously rejected the notion that the government has an interest in preventing the dissemination of truthful commercial information in order to prevent members of the public from making bad decisions with the information.''
In one of the great examples of the mixed messages of science, the same study that killed the blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx after showing that it had heart risks also found that the drug had a significant benefit: it prevented precancerous colon polyps in some patients, one of the study's principal researchers said. But the drug's maker, Merck, and the researcher, Dr. Robert Bresalier, said that neither Merck nor the researchers had known that Vioxx prevented polyps when Merck stopped the study and withdrew the drug from the market. ''At the time we made our decision to voluntarily withdraw Vioxx, the study had not yet been completed, and efficacy results had not been disclosed to Merck by the study's steering committee,'' Christopher Loder, a Merck spokesman, said. Instead, because an independent board overseeing the study had reported that Vioxx was associated with a twofold increase in heart attacks and strokes, an unacceptable risk for otherwise healthy people, Merck announced on Sept. 30 that it was halting the 2,000-patient study. It withdrew Vioxx from the market and stopped all other studies that asked if the drug could prevent cancer. The company says it has no plans to bring the drug back.
Ordinarily, the authors of such a paper would be expected to put all their data into GenBank, a database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. The Human Genome Project had been putting its data there all along, as it acquired the genetic sequences. But Celera would not put its data in GenBank, saying it feared that other companies, including its competitors, could simply take the fruits of its work free, even annotating and selling the entire human genome sequence. ''The bottom line,'' Dr. Samuel Broder, Celera's executive vice president for medical affairs, said, ''is that we want to make sure that the work and considerable effort is put to the benefit of the people who took the risk to invest in Celera. Therefore, we don't want to set up a system where other database providers can repackage the data and sell it on their own.'' And companies that want to use the data for commercial purposes, Dr. Broder said, ''should bear their fair share of the cost.''
''No one reacted,'' he said. For people who are allergic to peanuts, everyday life can be a minefield. They can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, hives, breathing problems and tightness in the throat. They also can cause severe reactions that lead to drops in blood pressure, inability to breathe and death. Dr. Sampson reviewed 32 deaths from peanut allergies, learning that most patients were 11 to 21, that they had eaten fewer than two peanuts and that virtually all had prior reactions, but much milder ones. Most victims did not have EpiPens, the epinephrine syringes that can stanch reactions if used immediately. Allergy histories are legion. One man broke out in hives and started gasping for air after he ate a Christmas cookie that had been removed from a cookie sheet with the spatula used to remove peanut cookies. A college student ate cookies from a vending machine, not realizing, because the label did not state it, that they contained peanuts. He died in his dormitory room.
''I think the results are very exciting,'' said Dr. Gary J. Nabel, the director of the vaccine research center at the National Institutes of Health, which paid for the study. ''I think it shows for the first time that by vaccinating in an appropriate way we can alter the course of H.I.V. infection in terms of its ability to cause disease. We need to be a little bit cautious in extrapolating to humans,'' he added. But, he said, ''by and large, this is good news.'' Dr. David Baltimore, chairman of the AIDS Vaccine Research Committee of the National Institutes of Health, an advisory committee on vaccine science and strategy, said the results raised hope of a practical way to battle the AIDS epidemic without the high cost and debilitating side effects of today's drugs. ''We can't bring drugs to all the people of the world, but you can imagine bringing a vaccine,'' said Dr. Baltimore, who is also president of the California Institute of Technology. ''Another way to look at this is that a vaccine of this sort, if it can reduce the viral load by orders of magnitude, offers the opportunity to break the transmission of the virus. And that's the most important thing of all.''
Personal trainers and exercise instructors design fitness programs around the maximum heart rate, often telling people to wear heart rate monitors and then to exercise at 80 to 90 percent of the maximum in brief spurts to build aerobic capacity and at 65 percent to 75 percent to build endurance. Some heart monitors built into exercise machines even shut the machines down if an exerciser exceeds 90 percent of the predicted maximum. But if the heart rate formula is wrong, these exercise prescriptions are misguided. ''If you're trying to improve their aerobic fitness or to train for certain endurance events, then you want to know with a reasonable accuracy what intensity you're exercising at,'' Dr. Seals said. ''If your estimate is 10 or 20 beats too low, then you're pretty far off.'' Exercise physiologists say, however, that being pretty far off is more common than most people expect. ''The more information we have, the more we realize that that formula is just a very rough consideration,'' said Dr. Jack H. Wilmore, an exercise physiologist at Texas A&amp;M.
The heart surgery data were clear, he said. The patients who did best were those whose surgeons were most experienced. Some busy doctors at community hospitals had better results than less-busy doctors at major medical centers. ''High-volume surgeons at lower-volume hospitals did just as well as high-volume surgeons at high-volume centers,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. ''And even if you were already at a high-volume hospital, it mattered if you chose a high-volume surgeon,'' he added. ''I think it's partly to do with the complexity of the procedure. How well you will do in the short and long term after a cardiovascular operation is often a function of how well your operation gets done.'' ''But what we found with many or most of the cancer operations was very different,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. A patient's chance of dying during or just after surgery was more related to the number of operations the hospital did and less to the number of operations the surgeon did. And, he reports in a paper that will soon be published in Annals of Surgery, cancer patients who go to hospitals that have more patients with their type of cancer also have better long-term survival.
Researchers have found that they can sharply reduce the death rate in high-risk heart attack patients with small but costly devices that are tucked under the skin of the chest and can avert potentially fatal heart rhythms. The devices, implantable defibrillators, sense when the heart's rhythm is going awry and administer a small electric shock to the heart to bring its fluttering rhythm back to normal, preventing sudden death. The new study found that the device was effective in patients whose hearts were so damaged from heart attacks that they could no longer pump blood effectively. Implantable defibrillators are routinely used for a relatively small group of patients who, like Vice President Dick Cheney, have demonstrable heart-rhythm disturbances. The new study showed that the devices are effective in a much larger group of people who have had serious heart attacks that placed them at risk for heart-rhythm disturbances, but may not have had such problems yet.
Dr. Jaenisch and Dr. Westhusin say that from preliminary molecular biology experiments they are starting to see confirmation of their belief that reprogramming can go awry. They are looking at molecular patterns of gene expression in embryos created by cloning and comparing them to the patterns in embryos created by normal fertilization. Their results so far are consistent with their hypothesis that reprogramming can result in random errors in almost any gene. But scientists say that every species is different, and it remains possible that it will be easier and safer to clone humans than it is to clone other species. Mouse eggs are fragile, Dr. Jaenisch said, which may complicate efforts to clone. The solutions used to bathe cattle embryos while they are grown in the laboratory seem to create a large-calf syndrome, resulting in large placentas and huge calves that often die around the time of birth. But clinics for in-vitro fertilization have vast experience in growing human embryos in the laboratory and have perfected the method.
''They will create Web sites that will rank these doctors on quality,'' Professor Reinhardt said. ''That will be the obvious next step. They will put these doctors into statistical fishbowls where everything about these doctors will be on the Web. ''I think the physicians will find it is not quite the world of the late 1950's and the 1960's,'' Dr. Reinhardt said. ''It will be utterly brutal.''
Every winter in the frigid town of South Bend, Ind., Dr. Rafat Ansari notices a definite increase in the number of his breast cancer patients who choose to have mastectomies rather than lumpectomies. The reason, he says, is quite simple. While the two treatments are equally effective in early breast cancer, there are considerations that go beyond the medical, Dr. Ansari said. With a mastectomy, in which a woman's entire cancerous breast is removed, once the surgery is completed the treatment is done. But women who have lumpectomies, in which just the cancerous tumor is taken out, must have six weeks of radiation treatments. For many of Dr. Ansari's patients, elderly women, living alone and afraid to go out on the icy roads, the thought of the daily trek to a radiation center is simply too much. They choose to have the breast removed instead. ''These little old ladies will tell you, 'Six weeks of radiation treatments? I'm not driving,' '' said Dr. Ansari, a cancer specialist in private practice in South Bend.
The pill, mifepristone, formerly known as RU-486, has long had a symbolic significance transcending its medical use. When it was approved by the Food and Drug Administration three years ago, advocacy groups insisted that it would change the nature of abortions, taking them out of clinics, where women might face harassment by abortion opponents, and into the privacy of a doctor's office. Abortion opponents said it was dangerous and would lead to suffering and deaths. So far, neither has been right. Eighty-eight percent of all abortions are in clinics, said Pamela Long, a spokeswoman for Danco Laboratories of New York, mifepristone's distributor. While more and more women are having nonsurgical abortions, known as medical abortions, not all clinics offer them and just 18 percent of eligible women choose them, said Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation. On the other hand, said Dr. Richard Hausknecht, Danco's medical director, ''the drug has turned out to be quite safe, quite effective.'' Some 160,000 to 165,000 American women used it from Sept. 28, 2000, when it was approved, through last March.
If you cut physicians' net incomes by 20 percent, it's a difference of one-tenth of 1 percent per annum in the growth rate of health care costs over 20 years. Cutting drug industry profits would get you even less, because half of drug industry profit is less than 20 percent than physicians' net income. As a rough estimate, drug industry profits might come to about 3 percent of health care spending. If you cut that in half, it would be 1.5 percent. Spread that over 20 years and you've got three-quarters of a percent per annum. That's the direct effect. The indirect effect could be much larger because if you cut drug industry profits in half you might have a big effect on the amount of investment in new research and development. That would show up in fewer new drugs and less spending.  Q.  Then what does it mean to say the prices of drugs are too high?  A.  From an economist's point of view? We mean that the market conditions are not producing a socially optimal allocation of resources. The classic example is a monopoly. If a company has a monopoly, then we usually expect that their prices will be higher than their socially desirable rate. But that's a question that the Federal Trade Commission or the Department of Justice ought to be looking into. It's independent of whether we cover the elderly for drugs.  Q.  What is driving up the cost of health care?  A.  The principle factor by far is medical innovations like new drugs, new surgical procedures and new diagnostic techniques. This is not just my opinion. I surveyed the 50 leading health economists in the country on this question. Over 80 percent of them agreed with me.  Q.  We spend more money on health care than other industrialized nations. Are we healthier?  A.  Let's put it this way. We spend 40 percent per capita more for services than people in Canada. We do get some services that they don't get. We get easier access. We don't have the long waiting lines.
''Coming up on 10 years now, there was a paper from Sweden where they took patients who had end-stage cancers and randomized them to receive placebos or Nsaids,'' he said, referring to aspirin and drugs that act like it. ''Although all the patients died, the patients who had the Nsaids lived twice as long. The paper is buried in the literature,'' he added, but it has haunted him. ''To take patients who are dying of cancer and prolong their lives by a couple of months is no small feat,'' Dr. Altroki said. And so, he said, he is not surprised by the way the field has been developing. But, he added, he knows that others are. ''Most people who are aware of the drugs are aware of their potential only as arthritis medicine,'' he said. ''There is a level of skepticism when you talk about an arthritis drug as a cancer drug. They think you're loony or a quack.''
The next step was to give statins to Alzheimer's patients and see whether the drugs affected the course of the disease. But, Dr. Wolozin said, ''the typical Alzheimer's thing happened -- the data were mixed.'' Despite the ambiguous findings, cholesterol does appear to be related to Alzheimer's, experts say. Several genes involved with cholesterol in addition to apo E4 also appear to affect the risk for Alzheimer's. Cholesterol, in fact, is so important to the brain, where it is used in nerve cell membranes, that the organ makes its own cholesterol independent of the liver, which produces the substance for the rest of the body. ''I hope the statins work,'' Dr. Wolozin said. ''It may be that we just haven't figured out the right drugs or the right time to treat.'' Other researchers are trying to see whether drugs that reduce inflammation can slow the progression of the disease. Studies have found that people who take aspirinlike anti-inflammatory drugs tend to have a lower incidence of Alzheimer's. But when Alzheimer's patients have taken anti-inflammatories, the study results have so far been disappointing. The disease was not slowed, but research is continuing.
One man suffered a catastrophic wound to his rectum, prostate, anus and bladder. The ghastly injury plunged him into shock immediately, but one of the backpack surgical teams got to him right away and did a damage control surgery. Then, he was put on an airplane equipped as a critical care unit and flown a few thousand miles to another hospital for another surgery to stabilize him. Then he was flown to Germany for reconstructive surgery. ''He's home with his family now,'' Dr. Carlton said. In any other war, he added, ''he would have been dead.'' A NATION AT WAR: MILITARY MEDICINE
A FRIEND recently noticed that I take one route going to the gym and another coming home. That's good, she told me. It will make you smarter. When I asked her why, she said scientists say that varying the routine helps the brain sprout new nerve connections and that, in turn, makes people more intelligent. At a dinner party last week, some of my friends were on a diet that excluded potatoes, rice, bread and pastas. Those tasty foods, they said, make people fat. Scientists say so. O.K., so my friends may be a bit misinformed. These days it seems that almost any scientific-sounding extrapolation for taking off pounds or putting on I.Q. points can quickly gain a seal of approval from public health groups or educators and help set policy for untold years to come. Problems arise, though, when such recommendations are launched without any scientific research. Just last Tuesday, 39 health organizations, including the American Public Health Organization, signed a petition to the Food and Drug Administration asking that food labels tell whether the sugar content occurs naturally or is added; that the agency recommend that Americans consume no more than 10 teaspoons of added sugar a day, or half of what they now consume. ''Heavy consumption of added sugar is contributing to soaring obesity rates,'' said Dr. Michael Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer health advocacy group in Washington.
Dr. Westhusin says that, as far as food safety is concerned, the question of whether the clone comes from an adult or an embryo ''is not a significant issue.'' The real change is in the public's perceptions, said Gregory Jaffe, who directs the biotechnology project at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a group in Washington that describes itself as a nutrition advocacy organization. ''The interest plays off of two things,'' Mr. Jaffe said. ''One is the concern over cloning humans and the other is the attention being given to genetically engineered foods and increased concern about the nature of the food supply. Animal cloning gets thrown in, whether it's the same or not.'' Mr. Jaffe says he sees no reason why meat or milk from clones would be unsafe, but he would like to see more data. Dr. Elizabeth M. Whelan, president of the American Council on Science and Health, a group in New York that describes itself as 400 doctors and scientists who release position statements on science and the environment, said if an animal was ill, cloned or not, ''it should not be in the food supply.'' But if it is healthy, she added, there is nothing special about a clone that should cause concern.
Three years ago, Christopher Mervin, the 36-year-old director of operations at Party City of Raleigh, had an executive physical, paid for by his company, which sent him to Florida for the two-day, $2,000 exam. Everything was fine, except for one problem. The doctors saw a spot on his lung and were not sure what it was. Eight months later, after extensive testing at Duke University and the University of North Carolina, after many sleepless nights, Mr. Mervin got his answer -- it was a birth defect, and of no consequence. He is not sorry he had that physical. ''If I was in a car accident and something happened and they X-rayed my chest and saw the mass, who knows what would have happened? They might have taken it out. Now it's in my medical history.'' Mr. Mervin is still having annual physical exams.
In a paper last year in Science, Dr. Faustman reported that she had cured female mice of diabetes and transplanted them with spleens from male mice. The islet cells that grew back were male, and they had come from the male spleens. The findings raised the question of what happens to people who have their spleens removed. Dr. Faustman went to the medical literature and discovered that most spleens were removed in emergency rooms and that few patients were followed afterward, with two exceptions. One was a group of patients in England with pancreatitis. To treat them, doctors had removed half of the pancreas. When they removed the right half of the organ, the patients were fine. But when they removed the left half, along with the attached spleen, patients often developed diabetes about five years later. The other case involved children with beta thalassemia, a genetic disease involving iron storage. Often, they developed enlarged spleens, which were removed. Five years or so later, many got diabetes.
As director of the National Institute on Aging, Dr. Hodes often speaks to policy makers, giving briefings on the latest scientific findings. But, he and others say, all too often there is a disconnect. There are some important findings: Health and nutrition early in life, even prenatally, can affect health in middle and old age and can affect how long people live. For the most part, genes have little effect on life spans. Controlling heart disease risk factors, like smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes, pays off in a more vigorous old age and a longer life. And it seems increasingly likely that education plays a major role in health and life spans. And then there is the question of what to do. It might seem logical to act now, pouring money into education or child health, for example. But scientists often say they would like good evidence beforehand that a program that sounds like it would make a difference, like keeping students in school longer, really works. And if the goal is longer and healthier lives, is that the most cost-effective way to spend public money?
All bacterial pneumonia patients should also get antibiotics within four hours of admission. But at Duke, fewer than half did. The doctors learned about their lapses when the hospital sent its data to Medicare. And they were aghast. They had neglected -- in most cases simply forgotten -- the very simple treatments that can make the biggest difference in how patients feel or how long they live. ''It's like the Elisabeth K√ºbler-Ross stages of grief,'' said Dr. Robert Califf, a professor of medicine at Duke. ''First you're in shock, then denial, and then you gradually come to terms with what needs to be done.'' Now, Dr. Califf said, the hospital is scrambling to make sure such treatments are not neglected again. Department of Veterans Affairs doctors had also been forgetting treatments like the pneumonia vaccine, said Dr. Jonathan Perlin, the agency's acting under secretary for health. ''Everyone knows who should get the vaccine,'' Dr. Perlin said. ''They can recite chapter and verse.''
If the number of lives saved is minuscule compared with the number of people who are harmed by overdiagnosis, by unnecessary treatments, by treatments that could have been delayed with no ill effects, then the value of the test has to be in question, he said. ''It's quite a sophisticated point,'' Dr. Efron said. ''I don't think you can blame the public. I blame the medical researchers who say, 'We're saving lives.' '' The questions are pressing because screening is different from any other medical program, said Dr. Goodman of Johns Hopkins. ''We bring it to healthy people, and those who test positive become sick people, the subjects of medical intervention,'' he explained. ''We need to be awfully careful.'' CONFRONTING CANCER  Correction:  April 18, 2002, Thursday  A diagram in Science Times on April 9 illustrating the way DNA chips can classify cancers depicted the double-helix strands of DNA incorrectly. In a vertical depiction of DNA, the strands should descend clockwise, not counterclockwise.
How good is his scheme? ''It is unproven, '' said Dr. Blackman of the National Institutes of Health. But, he added, ''each of those manipulations -- excesses of diet, exercise and alcohol, as well as sleep deprivation -- can lower testosterone levels.'' For those who do not want to use such tactics, illicit sources of the drugs are easy to find. ''It is sold by dealers, it is sold in gyms, it is sold over the Internet,'' said Dr. Charles E. Yesalis, a professor of health and human development at Pennsylvania State University and the author of the book ''Anabolic Steroids in Sports and Exercise.'' Some visit pharmacies. An American man in his 30's was recently spotted at a pharmacy in Tijuana, paying $258 for two small packets of Sostenon, an anabolic steroid. Others go to veterinary supply stores for drugs made for horses (their effects on humans have not been studied). At Viva Tijuana, a shopping center a two-minute walk from the border that has 40 pharmacies, PharmVet appears to be a pet-supply store. But a closer look reveals rows of anabolic steroids, made in Australia and Mexico.
''I was trying to define the risks and let individuals decide the benefits for themselves,'' he said. The risks included rupture and a hard and painful contraction of scar tissue over the implant. Most of the panel's scientists agreed that implants have not been linked to a risk of systemic diseases, like cancer, lupus or chronic fatigue, or neurological problems. Ultimately, Dr. Miller voted with the majority of the panel in its 9-to-6 vote last Wednesday to recommend that implants should once again be allowed back on the market in the United States. Now the decision is up to the F. D. A., which usually, although not always, does as its experts' committees advise. How Do I Look?
It also shows the workings of the medical market -- when insurers refused to pay, requiring customers to dig into their own pockets for the tests, scanning centers found themselves cutting prices to compete. Within a year, some centers said, prices fell to less than $500 from $1,000 or more. And when the flow of patients began to slow, the combination of low prices and reduced business spelled doom. It turned out that the assumption by radiologists -- that people would be willing to pay for early detection by scans and that there was a huge market waiting to be tapped -- were not true. The scans were something new in American medicine -- not like traditional screening scans, mammograms or colonoscopies, for example, in which patients are overseen by their doctors. People requested these scans on their own. They paid on their own, with no hints that insurers would start picking up the bill. And the reports came to the customers, not their doctors.
Doctors said it was hard to overestimate the difference. There was little change from Vietnam to the first gulf war in doctors' instruments, drugs, techniques or tactics. Except for some in the Army, which put surgeons in the front lines in Desert Storm, wounded soldiers received first aid from medics but no surgical care until they were evacuated to a larger hospital. Now, all the services have small mobile surgical teams scattered throughout the battlefield, where they operate on the most severely wounded as close to the front as possible. They do the minimum operation to stabilize patients for evacuation to a larger hospital. There, they may have another operation to further stabilize them for evacuation to a hospital in Europe. ''Never before in modern warfare have we done things so differently,'' said Lt. Col. Donald Jenkins, a surgeon who is chief of trauma at Wilford Hall Air Force Medical Center in San Antonio.
It also suggested a treatment strategy. ''If we believe that the actual plaques are the cause of Alzheimer's disease, then we need to dissolve them and clear them from the brain,'' Dr. Masliah said. ''But if we believe it is the precursor fragments, then we need to prevent those fragments from being formed,'' he added. ''The plaques are these huge aggregates of smaller components. Imagine that we have a drug that would break the plaque apart. Then you'd have all the little tiny components floating all over the place and the situation would be worse. So we should leave the plaques alone.'' Several strategies might work, Dr. Mucke said. All involve interfering with amyloid with the hope that treatment can be started, and the toxic protein blocked, before it starts aggregating in large clusters, forming plaques, and before brain cells die. One possibility is to stop the production of amyloid with drugs, now under development, that are akin to the protease inhibitors used to treat H.I.V.
TAP executives said they had been looking for an oral drug to treat erectile dysfunction. They knew that it was a widespread problem that, at the time, could only be treated with injectable drugs. ''Putting a needle in your penis is not everybody's idea of foreplay,'' said Dr. John Seely, the vice president for research and development at TAP. The company produced a drug for prostate cancer and had relationships with urologists, the doctors who treat erectile dysfunction. And, said Richard Masterson, TAP's vice president for licensing, the company was small and ready to take chances. When Dr. El-Rashidy came to TAP, ''we were probably more willing to gamble than bigger traditional pharmaceutical companies,'' Mr. Masterson said. Dr. Seely said, ''Peripherally, we were aware that Viagra was being studied, but we had no idea how effective it was or how big the marketplace was.'' Kim Modory, a spokeswoman for TAP, said it was too soon to say how the drug would fare against Viagra.
''Once you know there is something that is important for a virus to do you can figure out a way to stop it,'' said Dr. John Coffin, a professor of molecular biology and microbiology at Tufts University. In the new study, the researchers began with a well-known observation, that some species of Old World primates, including rhesus monkeys, macaques, mangabeys, baboons and African green monkeys, seem impervious to H.I.V., although they are susceptible to a similar virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, or S.I.V. Dr. Sodroski and others who wanted to study human AIDS in animals began looking for a way to infect monkey cells with the human virus. A method that seemed to work, they found, was to make viruses that were part H.I.V. and part S.I.V. Using such hybrids, Dr. Sodroski said, ''we could infect monkeys and cause AIDS.'' Then the researchers asked themselves what made the difference between a virus that could infect monkeys and one that could not. They focused on the capsid, the candy-corn shaped casing that surrounds the virus's genes when it enters a cell.
As he examined the manuscript pages, piecing together their text, he realized that what Archimedes was really asking seemed to be, ''How many ways can you put the pieces together to make a square?'' That question, Dr. Netz said, ''has mathematical meaning.'' ''People assumed there wasn't any combinatorics in antiquity,'' he went on. ''So it didn't trigger the observation when Archimedes says there are many arrangements and he will calculate them. But that's what Archimedes did; his introductions are always to the point.'' But did Archimedes solve the problem? ''I am sure he solved it or he would not have stated it,'' Dr. Netz said. ''I do not know if he solved it correctly.'' As for the name, derived from the Greek word for stomach, mathematicians are uncertain. But Dr. Diaconis has a hunch. ''It comes from 'stomach turner,' '' he said. ''If you get involved with it, that's what happens.''
Now, men with moderate symptoms are treated with medications and most get relief. The operation, which involves cutting much of the tissue inside the prostate, is for men who cannot be helped any other way. Dr. John D. McConnell, a urologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, ticked off today's options: watchful waiting, medications, a half-dozen minimally invasive surgeries, traditional surgery and variations on those themes. When a man visits Dr. McConnell about urination problems, he said, the first question he asks is how bothersome are the symptoms. ''Many men with B.P.H. have symptoms, but they may just be getting up once a night to urinate or they may just have a slow urine stream. Often they just need reassurance that they don't have prostate cancer,'' he said. The condition, in fact, has nothing to do with cancer. The prostate gland, which surrounds the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the penis, is about the size of a walnut. It often enlarges in middle-aged and older men, squeezing and narrowing the urethra while putting pressure on the bladder. The gland can continue to grow after symptoms of B.P.H. emerge, worsening urinary problems, but often it does not.
For example, it is commonly assumed that painful or blistering sunburns early in life set the stage for the skin cancer later on. But while some studies show a small association, Dr. Ackerman says, others show none. And even studies that do show an effect disagree on when the danger period for sunburns is supposed to be. Taken as a whole, Dr. Ackerman argues, the research is inconsistent and fails to make the case. Common wisdom also has it that sunscreens protect against melanoma. But Dr. Ackerman points to a recent editorial in the journal Archives of Dermatology concluding that there was no evidence to support that idea. Finally, many people assert that the more intense a person's sun exposure, the greater the risk of melanoma. For example, Dr. Darrell S. Rigel, a New York dermatologist, points out that the incidence of melanoma increases as distance to the equator decreases. Dr. Rigel, a past president of the American Academy of Dermatology and the lead editor of ''Cancer of the Skin,'' a major textbook in the field, cites this as a compelling reason to conclude that sun exposure causes the skin cancer.
''It's been sort of like pushing a big rock uphill,'' Dr. David Gordon, special assistant for clinical studies at the heart institute, said. ''It's not like a polio vaccine -- one day you have a problem and the next day you don't,'' Dr. Gordon said. ''But if you look at what it was like 50 years ago and what it is like today, it's amazing.'' In the 1960's and 1970's, high blood pressure and cholesterol were much less controlled than they are today. There were drugs for high blood pressure, Dr. Braunwald said, but most people who had the condition were not being effectively treated. Even in 1971, he said, high blood pressure, defined as at least 160 over 95, was controlled in just 16 percent of patients in the United States. Now, said Thomas Thom, a statistician at the heart institute, 65 percent of patients with blood pressure that high are reducing it with medication. He noted, though, that high blood pressure now is defined as at least 140 over 90, and with that definition, only 31 percent have their blood pressure controlled.
What would happen, he and Dr. Martin asked, if athletes parceled out their calories more evenly? In a recent study, they recruited 60 college athletes. Thirty were told to eat three high-carbohydrate energy bars a day, in midmorning, midafternoon and after dinner. The others got packets of a sweet powder to mix with water and drink three times a day. The athletes thought the study was comparing liquid to solid snacks. In fact, the powder contained no calories, and each energy bar had 250 calories. No one gained or lost weight; those eating the energy bars unconsciously adapted to the extra calories by eating less at other times. But the athletes who ate the energy bars lost nearly 2 percent of their body fat, a statistically significant change, and greatly improved their performance on a 30-second test of anaerobic power and endurance. ''It's a test from hell,'' Dr. Benardot said.
But the report raised concerns among others, who said it was a step down the slippery slope leading to cloned babies. Richard Doerflinger, whose title is director of pro-life activities at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said: ''Up until now, people were beginning to wonder whether human cloning for any purpose was feasible at all. This development makes it feasible enough to be a clear and present danger.'' The Korean report will influence the political debate over embryonic stem cell research, which is unfolding on Capitol Hill. The House is expected to vote as early as next week on a measure that would expand federal financing for embryonic stem cell studies. The measure, which has created deep divisions among Republicans, does not address therapeutic cloning. But a second bill, introduced by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, would permit taxpayer financing of therapeutic cloning studies, while prohibiting cloning for reproduction.
Those who provide the scans say they are a real service. Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper, chairman and chief executive of the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, says he was one of the first to offer whole body scans, in the mid-1990's. The research arm of his center, the Cooper Institute, is in the midst of a federally financed study of heart scans to determine whether they have medical benefit. Meanwhile, the clinic is offering them with whole body scans, more than 35,000 to date. Dr. Cooper says he believes the scans are saving lives, adding that he and his wife have had several. Cooper Clinic doctors have found, for example, small, solid kidney tumors in 70 people who had no symptoms, and all but three turned out to be cancerous. ''We know that if it breaks through the kidney capsule, only 6 percent survive the next five years,'' Dr. Cooper said. ''Do you want to take that chance? I don't.''
The condition kills at least 9,000 people a year in the United States. With screening, ''the science comes down to saying this is worth doing,'' said Dr. Ned Calonge, chairman of the task force and chief medical officer of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. ''We think our recommendation will translate into physicians incorporating screening into their practice,'' said Dr. Calonge, who does not screen for or repair aneurysms nor determine payments for health care, and said he has no conflicts of interest in making the recommendation. The recommendation affects about 9.8 million Americans, the 70 percent of the nation's 14 million men ages 65 to 75 who are smokers or have ever smoked. The task force defined the group to include any man who had smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his life. The test was not recommended for women because they are at much lower risk of developing the aneurysms.
A REVOLUTION AT 50
Correction:  January 14, 2004, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a front-page article on Sunday about cancer prevention at medical centers misidentified the health agency that is requiring prevention components at designated centers and spending $500 million, or 12 percent of its budget, toward prevention. It is the National Cancer Institute, not its parent agency, the National Institutes of Health. The article also misstated the affiliation of a cancer expert, Dr. Barnett Kramer. He is director of the office of disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health, not the Cancer Institute.
But Dr. Lerner added, ''That notion of getting it all, of the surgeon coming out of the operating room and saying, 'We got it all,' has such cultural resonance in the entire cancer experience and the entire way we treat and understand cancer.'' Some doctors have worried that the radiation treatments usually given after a lumpectomy may cause cancers themselves. ''We know it takes 15 years or so to begin to see radiation-induced cancers,'' said Dr. Patrick Borgen, chief of breast surgery at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. ''These papers put that concern to rest.'' Not every woman will want a lumpectomy, doctors and advocates for women with breast cancer said. But, they added, women should know they have a choice. ''I think this is great,'' said Dr. H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth Medical School. ''This is Cadillac data, just what we want. Someone could always have argued that things might change at a distant date, that maybe the problems with a lumpectomy wouldn't occur for 10 or 15 years. This puts that to rest.''
They tracked the one region of the mitochondrial genetic material that normally varies from person to person, a region, Dr. Cohen said, in which genes are inactive. ''There are differences, but they are not meaningful,'' he said. But in an editorial published in the journal Science on April 20, two ethicists, Erik Parens of the Hastings Center in Garrison, N.Y., and Eric Juengst of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, suggested that such treatments, because they result in permanent genetic alterations that in turn will be passed on to the babies' children, might not have been approved by a federal committee that oversees experiments that involve gene transfer. But, they explained, since the work  was privately funded, the researchers had no obligation to ask the committee's permission to go ahead. The federal government does not pay for research related to human fertilization and early embryo development. Dr. Cohen said: ''We didn't come to them because they didn't give us federal funds. I would be happy to talk to them if they gave us funds.''
''This isn't rocket science,'' said Dr. John Wasson, a Dartmouth doctor who invented one of the new methods. ''With most people, you can make dramatic improvements if they get a little more attention and are told how to manage their own issues.'' Doctor Paved Way The new scheduling system used at the Anchorage clinic had its start when Dr. Mark Murray, a family practice doctor at the Kaiser Permanente medical center in Roseville, Calif., reached the end of his rope. The backlog had gotten so bad that patients  had to wait an average of 55 days for nonemergency appointments. By the time they finally got into a doctor's examining room, they would be so annoyed that the doctors found themselves spending a third of each appointment apologizing or blaming someone else for the long waits and rushed visits. Dr. Murray decided there had to be another way. Turning to industry for inspiration, he reasoned that the crush of patients was like a warehouse full of goods. So how, he asked, did companies keep their warehouses from overflowing?
At the same time, the number of sigmoidoscopies, which look only at the lower part of the colon, where most cancers occur, dropped 57 percent among Medicare recipients, to 236,139 in 2002 from 543,502 in 2000. In 2000, Medicare paid for 1,759,880 fecal occult blood tests, a yearly screening for blood in the stool, which can be a sign of polyps. In 2002, the number was 1,609,391. And in 2000, there were 208 barium enemas provided to Medicare patients. In 2002, that number was 139. The colonoscopy is widely regarded as the most accurate test because it allows the doctor to see the entire colon and remove polyps. But it has drawbacks. Dr. Fletcher notes that 2 patients in 1,000 have an accidental perforation of the colon, which may necessitate immediate major abdominal surgery. While that risk is low for an individual, ''when you start screening a nation, you put a lot of people in peril.''
An early chapter in the story of bisphosphonates (pronounced bis-FOS-fo-nates) was written in 2003, when a letter in The Journal of Oral Maxillofacial Surgery called osteonecrosis of the jaw ''a growing epidemic.'' Its author, Dr. Robert E. Marx, chief of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the University of Miami, reported on 36 patients who had received intravenous bisphosphonates. All had ''painful bone exposure,'' as is typical with the condition, and ''were unresponsive to surgical or medical treatments,'' Dr. Marx wrote. ''The common denominator,'' he said in a telephone interview, ''was that they all had cancer. Then we started looking at their treatment. The one common thread was bisphosphonates.'' But not everyone was convinced. ''My first reaction was that maybe there is an association but this wasn't enough,'' said Dr. Regina Landesberg, an oral and maxillofacial surgeon at Columbia University. ''I wanted to see more data.'' Meanwhile, another oral and maxillofacial surgeon, Dr. Salvatore Ruggiero of Long Island Jewish Hospital, was gathering his own data. At first he saw patients with breast cancer or multiple myeloma who arrived with exposed bone in their mouths.
Dr. Miller invited Dr. Seeff, who is senior scientist for hepatitis C research at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and a liver disease specialist at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington, to help use the blood to ask whether the hepatitis C virus had existed 50 years ago and, if it had, what had happened to people who had been infected. All they had to do was test the blood and track down anyone who had been infected. Dr. Miller, who had moved to the medical follow-up agency of the National Academy of Sciences, could get death certificates and other crucial medical information. First, Dr. Seeff and Dr. Miller consulted with ethicists to determine whether this was the right thing to do. Dr. Miller was told that there would be no problem but Dr. Seeff got conflicting opinions. Some ethicists told him to go ahead but others said he should first get permission from each man, a task that Dr. Seeff concluded was logistically impossible.
The hybrid viruses had the capsids of monkey viruses but the genes inside were from the human virus. What would happen, the researchers wondered, if they made viruses with capsids that were mixtures of humans and monkey? Such viruses, the researchers found, could no longer infect monkey cells. ''As soon as you put the capsid from H.I.V. into the viruses, they suddenly were blocked in monkey cells,'' Dr. Sodroski said. Seeking to understand why this was so, the researchers discovered that it was the monkey's TRIM5-alpha protein that, in a way not yet understood, prevented the infection. If the scientists put the TRIM5-alpha gene into human cells, the human cells made the monkey protein and were protected from H.I.V. infection. If, however, the researchers blocked the gene in monkey cells, preventing the cells from making TRIM5-alpha, the cells became susceptible to H.I.V. TRIM5-alpha, Dr. Sodroski said, is not just a peculiar monkey protein that happens to block H.I.V. It appears to be part of an elaborate collection of poorly understood proteins that cluster together, drifting through cells and apparently stopping viruses when they enter.
If there is anything to the notion of subliminal messages linking health and beauty, I've clearly been seduced by them. I find it hard to think of health without envisioning someone young and beautiful. Even the words we use are a sort of double speak. ''Health'' clubs? At the health club I frequent, few of us are sweating away on the elliptical cross-trainers for our health. Yes, we feel good after a tough workout. But we love the machines because they burn so many calories. I lift weights for muscle definition, not explicitly to make myself healthier. Most ''health foods'' have more to do with beauty than health; they tend to be ones that are low in calories, allowing us to eat more. I somehow doubt that most of us who buy them do so because we think that we'll prevent an illness. Disease prevention seems so distant and beauty so immediate. If I take care of myself, I might slightly diminish my risk for heart disease in the future. But I might look better next week.
''What I was interested in was not the mechanics but the motives,'' Ms. Goodman said. Five years ago, as she started research for the book, an acquaintance of her brother-in-law gave her some advice. ''Allegra,'' he told her, ''what you have to capture is the bitterness of being a postdoc.'' She laughs in telling the story. Bitterness, she says, she can do. She is a novelist, she understands bitterness. What she had to learn was the minute, telling details of how a lab actually works. That meant that she had to go to a lab and observe and then write about it so vividly and accurately that scientists would feel she must be one of them. She knew that researchers would be nervous with her hanging around, taking notes, and she did not want to impose on her family or friends. So she found friends of friends who let her into their laboratories at the Whitehead Institute, not far from her home in Cambridge.
In their study, published today in the journal Science, Dr. Letvin and his colleagues injected eight rhesus monkeys with DNA that included two AIDS virus genes. Since the genes were not a virus, the vaccine itself could not transmit disease. Having inoculated the monkeys, the scientists then infected the animals with an AIDS virus that would ordinarily destroy their immune systems in weeks and kill them in a few months. The monkeys that were given the vaccine lived for 140 days -- the length of the experiment -- with no detectable virus in their blood, no deterioration in their immune systems and no signs of ill health. Dr. Letvin said he is continuing to monitor how long the effects last. Eight monkeys injected with a sham vaccine and then with the virus became ill in weeks, with high levels of the virus in their blood and hobbled immune systems. Half were dead in 140 days.
At the baby's birth, Dr. Schuelke said, his doctors were worried. The infant was jittery, jerking his limbs, much the way people sometimes involuntarily jerk their legs when they are falling asleep. ''At first we thought it might be epilepsy,'' Dr. Schuelke said. After two months, the jerking movements had subsided, but the puzzle of the baby's muscles remained. Then Dr. Schuelke had an idea. He knew that Dr. Se-Jin Lee at Johns Hopkins University, working with mice, had found that when both copies of a gene for a protein called myostatin were inactivated, the animals grew up lean and so muscular that Dr. Lee called them ''mighty mice.'' It turned out that cattle breeders, decades ago, had stumbled upon the same genetic trick, developing a strain known as Belgian Blue, or double muscle cattle. The cattle are hefty, very meaty and lean, and they, too, researchers later found, had inactive myostatin genes.
The Vista project began a few years ago when Medicare officials realized that help for small medical practices was in its own backyard. The federal government had already paid hundreds of millions of dollars to develop Vista, and now uses it in the Veterans Administration's 1,300 inpatient and outpatient facilities, which maintain more than 10 million records and treat more than five million veterans a year. Why not give Vista to doctors? In fact, though few knew, Vista had been available all along to anyone who submitted a Freedom of Information Act request. Over the years, the program had accrued a passionate following and even an organization, World Vista, founded in 2002 mostly by V.A. employees to help spread it throughout the world. One reason for their enthusiasm was that no company owns Vista so anyone can modify and enhance it. It is, said Joseph Dal Molin, director of World Vista, a survival of the fittest. ''What's good survives,'' he said.
All that adds up to a problem, says Dr. Madelyn Fernstrom, who directs the weight-management center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ''It's disturbing, in my view, the amount of attention this compound is getting,'' Dr. Fernstrom said. ''I'm underwhelmed by the results so far.'' Dr. Jeffrey Flier, an obesity researcher at Harvard Medical School who consults for several biotechnology companies, says he regularly gets calls from venture capitalists and other drug companies asking what he knows. ''The question is, 'Is this stuff any good?''' Dr. Flier said. ''Or, 'I hear it's not quite as good as somebody thinks it is.''' He tells them, he says, that ''from what I hear it's not good enough to have this sort of hype around it.'' Dr. Fernstrom says the enthusiasm of patients for rimonabant reflects the desperation that obese people often feel. Most have failed with diet after diet. The two drugs on the market for obesity, sibutramine (sold under the brand name Meridia), which diminishes appetite by affecting brain neurotransmitters, and xenical (sold as Orlistat), which blocks the absorption of fat from the intestines, result in modest weight loss. And rimonabant has a story that seems to make sense.
Professor Thorpe said he was startled by how arbitrary medical pricing seemed to be. ''It was a real eye-opener,'' he said. Irene Wielawski, who studied local efforts to provide care for the uninsured under a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation described pricing disparities in a recent issue of the journal Health Affairs. When Ms. Wielawski's son needed a hernia operation, she wrote, her insurance company, Aetna, paid $3,509.50 for a surgeon, the surgical suite, a pediatrician, laboratory tests and an X-ray. But an uninsured Sacramento carpenter she was following as part of her research also needed a hernia operation. Hospital officials told him that the surgeon's bill alone would be $3,000 to $5,000 and that he needed to make a down payment of $1,500. Unable to pay, he put off the operation for a year until a charity project paid for it. ''That happens everywhere,'' said Dr. Guy Clifton, the chief of neurosurgery at the University of Texas-Houston Medical School. ''If it's not an emergency and you can't pay for it, you don't get care.''
''Parents don't want their baby called an ICSI baby,'' Dr. Schatten said. ''They just want a normal kid and so they often drop out of studies.'' The few attempts by infertility specialists to keep track of ICSI babies yielded mixed results. Some studies found that the babies appeared normal. Others reported slight increases in birth defects, especially abnormalities of the sex chromosomes. But it was not clear whether those were problems caused by the procedure or inherited from the fathers who were, after all, infertile. Some doctors point out that virtually all chromosomal defects are lethal to embryos and so, even if ICSI damages an embryo, nature will screen out those with severe problems. If there were an epidemic of severely damaged ICSI babies, it would be noticed, these doctors say. Dr. Alan DeCherney, a fertility specialist at the University of California in Los Angeles, said that when he counsels couples about ICSI, ''I tell them the risks appear to be extremely small.''
That is what happened with the lung operation, medical experts said. By the mid-1990's it had grown so popular that Medicare envisioned soon paying for tens of thousands of operations a year. But medical experts were concerned, because the positive reports were from surgeons who did not did include, for comparison, a control group of patients who were randomly assigned not to have the operation. Such uncontrolled studies have often produced misleading results. In 1996, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which is responsible for Medicare, and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute agreed to begin a five-year national study that would include such a control group. And Medicare did something it had never done before. It said it would pay for the experimental procedure only if patients joined the clinical trial and agreed to be picked at random to have the operation or be in the control group. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute insisted that surgeons who were participating in the study not offer the operation on the side to paying patients.
The risks of being socially isolated are ''phenomenal,'' Dr. Berkman says, associated with twofold to fivefold increases in mortality rates. And the correlations emerged in study after study and in country after country. Yet, Dr. Berkman adds, there was that perennial question: Did social isolation shorten lives or were people isolated because they were sick and frail and at great risk of death? She knows that sometimes ill health leads to social isolation. But, Dr. Berkman says, the more she investigated, the more evidence she found that social isolation might also lead to poor health and a shorter life by, for example, increasing stress and making it harder to get assistance when ill. But researchers also warn that their findings that education and, to a lesser degree, social networks, may directly affect health do not necessarily mean that other hypotheses would also hold up. The cautionary tale, health economists say, is the story of the link between health and wealth.
Valentin Keller enlisted in an all-German unit of the Union Army in Hamilton, Ohio, in 1862. He was 26, a small, slender man, 5 feet 4 inches tall, who had just become a naturalized citizen. He listed his occupation as tailor. A year later, Keller was honorably discharged, sick and broken. He had a lung ailment and was so crippled from arthritis in his hips that he could barely walk. His pension record tells of his suffering. ''His rheumatism is so that he is unable to walk without the aid of crutches and then only with great pain,'' it says. His lungs and his joints never got better, and Keller never worked again. He died at age 41 of ''dropsy,'' which probably meant that he had congestive heart failure, a condition not associated with his time in the Army. His 39-year-old wife, Otilia, died a month before him of what her death certificate said was ''exhaustion.''
It was in Miami, with substantial financing from Children's Hospital, that Dr. Matalon, in 1993, finally isolated the Canavan disease gene. ''My contract said every invention I make would be theirs, and that's it,'' Dr. Matalon said. ''I am not in the inventing business. I am a research person. If they make money on me, I don't care.'' The patent for the gene was issued to the Miami Children's Hospital Research Institute on Oct. 21, 1997. In the meantime, Dr. Matalon had moved on to the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. The Miami Children's Hospital Research Institute, an affiliate of the hospital, retains control of the commercial uses of the Canavan disease gene. Marc Golden of Golden Group Intellectual Capital was brought in to help the hospital decide how best to use the patent. At first, he said, the hospital considered donating the gene patent to the public and forgoing royalties on any test. It eventually chose not to, he said, because it feared that there were so few people who needed the test that laboratories would not bother to publicize it.
That study, by Dr. William A. Baumgartner, chief of cardiac surgery at Hopkins, and his colleagues compared 140 patients who had standard bypasses with heart-lung machines to 92 closely matched patients who had severe heart disease but no operations. All had detailed neuropsychiatric assessments at the start of the study, before any patients had their operations, and three months after the surgery and again a year later. Patients in each group declined in their mental abilities, Dr. Baumgartner found. But there was no difference in the rate or extent of decline in those who had the surgery as compared to those who did not. Most likely, he said, the declines stemmed from aging and chronic diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure and the effects of blocked blood vessels that supply the heart and brain. ''I don't think you can incriminate the pump for these long-term changes,'' Dr. Baumgartner said.
The findings may also fuel the debate over whether it is appropriate to use tissue from aborted fetuses to treat diseases. Despite their disappointment, some researchers said they hoped that the results would not bring fetal cell research to an abrupt  halt. The research has been controversial because the fetal cells were obtained from abortion clinics. ''This is still our one great hope for a cure,'' said Dr. J. William Langston, who is scientific director and chief executive officer at The Parkinson's Institute in Sunnyvale, Calif. Parkinson's disease occurs when cells of the substantia nigra region in the base of the brain die, for unknown reasons. The hope was that fetal substantia nigra cells might take over for them. But, the study showed, in older patients the operation had no benefit and in some younger patients, the transplants brought on nightmarish side effects. Although the paper depicts the patients with the side effects in impassive clinical terms, doctors who have seen them paint a very different picture.
Dr. Eisenberg was unavailable for an interview, but one of his employees, Don Ark, said that since last May, the van has gone to two sites, an Indian reservation and an electrical workers' union. As for Dr. Giannulli, he has moved on to other things. He founded a company, CareTools Inc., which sells software for medical record keeping to doctors' offices. That, he says, is the new frontier in medicine.
The side effects include abdominal pain, bleeding and often nausea that usually lasts for 9 to 16 days. The third visit, 12 days later, is to be sure the abortion is complete. Dr. William West, who practices at an abortion clinic in Dallas, said most women who arrived asking for the pill changed their minds when they heard what was involved. ''Most say, 'Heck, I don't want to go through all that,' '' he said. ''They say, 'Let's get it over with today,' '' and choose a surgical abortion. Fewer than 1 percent of his patients end up taking the pill, he said. Dr. William Ramos, the director of a Las Vegas abortion clinic, said he offered Mifeprex and even advertised in the Yellow Pages that he had it. But he does not try to steer women toward the pill because he thinks surgery is better. A medical abortion with drugs, he said, ''is more involved, it is a longer procedure, it is more expensive and, I think, it is more uncomfortable.''
With this background, Mr. Troy remarked, ''some have said that it would be almost legal malpractice if we did not think about the implications of the First Amendment decisions that came down recently.'' He added, ''As a lawyer, my job is to prevent the agency from being sued, and losing.'' In comments to the F.D.A., many companies said regulations were needed to protect the public health, but asked that some of the current ones be relaxed. Dr. Rhona Applebaum, executive vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the National Food Processors Association, describes agency regulations as ''command and control.'' Dr. Applebaum added: ''The way it stands now, any type of implied disease benefit, the agency throws it into our faces: 'No, you can't do it. You need a new drug approval.' We're saying no way, not if the information we are providing is substantiated by science.'' For example, Dr. Applebaum said, many studies suggest that dietary calcium is associated with lower blood pressure. But the F.D.A. does not find the evidence conclusive. Food manufacturers would be happy to put in disclaimers, she said. ''You could say, 'While inconclusive, new research seems to indicate . . .' or 'Preliminary evidence suggests that calcium promotes healthy blood pressure.' But right now we can't say it.''
The researchers published similar results in 1997, providing data five years after the study began. There was no difference in the mortality rates between the two groups, but many said insufficient time had passed. The researchers ruled out the possibility that the women who were assigned to examine their breasts did not do so, or that the control group started examining their breasts on their own. The researchers reported they went to great lengths to be certain that the self-exams were done correctly and regularly. Women in the control group were not taught how to examine their breasts, nor did doctors examine their breasts during routine physical exams. The results are consistent with those of a similar study in Russia that began around the same time. That study involved women in St. Petersburg and in Moscow. So far, only the results from the study in St. Petersburg have been published.
One of these, C-reactive protein, is a measure of inflammation. The others, fibrinogen and Factor VIII, are blood-clotting proteins that are activated by inflammation, Dr. Jeremy Walston, one of the Johns Hopkins researchers, explained. While these proteins also can be elevated in people with heart disease or diabetes, the frailty link was independent of these other chronic diseases. People who were not frail but had these markers of frailty were at the highest risk for becoming frail, the investigators report. Researchers stress that patients should not expect to have blood tests for frailty; the biochemical abnormalities are not sufficiently specific, occurring whenever there is inflammation. Instead, they say, the blood tests can give them clues to understanding the events that conspire to result in frailty. Dr. Lipsitz said more and more chronic diseases appeared to be linked to a state of chronic inflammation. Ulcers, for example, now known to be caused by a bacterial infection, are accompanied by inflammation. There also are hints that heart disease and Alzheimer's may be tied to inflammation. So if frailty also has hallmarks of inflammation, that would seem to fit the pattern, Dr. Lipsitz said.
It is not a cure; it does not reverse the disease. And, for now, it is not sold in this country. Forest Laboratories, which has licensed it, has applied to the Food and Drug Administration to market it and does not expect to hear anything until fall. But that, Mr. Baron soon learned, was not an obstacle. The drug is sold in Europe, and the F.D.A. generally allows patients to import unapproved drugs for their personal use if there is no approved treatment for their condition and if they can supply the name and address of a doctor who will supervise the treatment. And there are plenty of Internet companies ready to fill the demand. When Mr. Baron telephoned Forest, the company gave him three places to call, two in Europe and one in the United States. He chose the one in this country, GlobalRx, persuaded his wife's doctor to write a prescription, and sent in his order. Soon, the drug arrived in the mail and Betty Baron began taking it.
''With cloning, you are asking an egg to reprogram in minutes or, at most, in hours,'' said Dr. Rudolph Jaenisch, a professor of biology at the Whitehead Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''That's where the major problem is.'' All the evidence so far, scientists say, indicates that the breathtakingly rapid reprogramming in cloning can introduce random errors into the clone's DNA, subtly altering individual genes with consequences that can halt embryo or fetal development, killing the clone. Or the gene alterations may be fatal soon after birth  or lead to major medical problems later in life. Some scientists say they shudder to think what might happen if human beings are cloned with today's techniques. While arguments over the ethics of human cloning have dominated the debate, these scientists say the real issue is the likelihood that clones would have genetic abnormalities that could be fatal or subtle but devastating. Until that problem is solved, they say, human cloning should be out of the question.
Doctors and scientists urged the Federal Government today to start a large study of a new way of detecting lung cancer as soon as possible, seizing what they see as a small window of time to discover if the method works before it becomes so widely used that no one will question it. If the study is begun, it would be one of the fastest movements in medical history from the discovery of a method to its large-scale testing. Dr. Peter Greenwald, director of division of cancer prevention at the National Cancer Institute, said he did not know of another example in diagnostic imaging of a large study's starting so soon after a discovery. The lung cancer screening method, known as spiral CT scanning, is so new that doctors are still learning its capabilities. It can find lung cancers when they are as small in diameter as a soda straw, as compared with chest X-rays that find them when they are about the size of a quarter.
''In the morning, the dead bodies are stacked about the morgue like cord wood,'' Dr. Vaughan said. ''This picture was painted on my memory cells at the division hospital, Camp Devens, in the fall of 1918, when the deadly influenza virus demonstrated the inferiority of human inventions in the destruction of human life.'' Still, scientists are left with an abiding mystery: Where did the 1918 virus come from? Investigators know more than they once did. They know exactly what the virus looked like, thanks to Dr. Jeffrey Taubenberger, chief of the division of molecular pathology at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, and his colleagues, who obtained snippets of preserved lung tissue from three victims of the 1918 flu and managed to fish out shards of the virus and piece together its genes. Although the 1918 virus was a strain different from the A (H5N1) virus that is now killing birds, it was, Dr. Taubenberger found, a bird flu.
''Doctors as a group are incredibly timid when it comes to controversy and social issues,'' Dr. Hern said. ''There are very few doctors who will accept the controversy that goes with medical abortions.'' And, he added, social controversy is almost guaranteed since it would be likely that people will soon know that a doctor is providing mifepristone. Some opponents of abortion said that if they learned that a local doctor was providing mifepristone, they would let people in their communities know. ''At the national level, I don't think there would be a campaign,'' said Dr. Richard Land, who is president of the Southern Baptist Convention's ethics and religious liberties convention. ''But I have no doubt,'' Dr. Land said, ''that there would be churches that felt that that was something people should know when making a decision about what doctors to see. I certainly would not want my wife and daughters going to a doctor who dispensed that pill.''
A dispute over mammography is growing, with Senate hearings planned, professional medical groups weighing in and others persuading expert panels to help them decide what to believe. At issue is whether the breast cancer screening test, which has become a yearly ritual for millions of women, makes any difference in preventing breast cancer deaths. In October, the British journal Lancet reported that despite a widespread belief that mammography saved lives, studies had found only a marginal benefit. In addition, the article's authors said they could point to flaws in those studies so troubling that the benefits of mammograms were unclear. Last week, an independent panel that provides information used by the National Cancer Institute to inform the public said that in light of the new analysis it could no longer tell women that mammograms prevented breast cancer deaths. This week, two senators said they planned hearings on the question. One of them, Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, has scheduled a Feb. 28 hearing of the public health subcommittee of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, and the other, Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who heads the committee that determines appropriations for the National Institutes of Health, will schedule a separate hearing on the issue, his staff said.
''We've totally confused the radar,'' Professor Etcoff said. ''We're looking younger and younger and healthier and healthier. We're master cheats, I think.'' And master dreamers. I know I'm being conned by the advertisements and the images. I refuse on general principle to buy beauty products with added vitamins, minerals or herbs. I laugh at the word ''health,'' mocking it for pretending to be some nirvana of perfect harmony that is always just out of reach. But with health (read ''beauty'') beckoning, it is hard to escape the illusion that, someday, if I just put in a bit more time and a bit more effort, I might get there.
''I don't think our brains have evolved to think about risk statistically,'' Dr. Slovic said. ''One of the first things we think about is, Well, is this relevant to me?'' So while 7 of 1,000 is the same as 0.7 percent, people perceive that 7 out of 1,000 is a higher risk. ''Even if it is 1 out of 1,000, people think, There is an individual out there dying,'' Dr. Slovic said. ''You can relate to that.'' Even harder to understand is relative risk, medical experts said. Dr. Ann Partridge, a medical oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said doctors often used the language of relative risk, leading patients to overestimate the benefits of therapy. ''A lot of times, when doctors explain the benefits of chemotherapy, they will say something like, 'it will give you a 30 percent decrease in the risk of recurrence,' '' Dr. Partridge said. ''But in some women, the risk of a recurrence may only be 20 percent,'' if they have no further treatment, she added. And so, she said, for those women, a 30 percent decrease in a risk of 20 percent really means that the risk reduction is 6 percent.
Dr. Edmund R. Burke, a former student of Dr. Costill who directs the exercise science program at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, said that Dr. Costill was one of the few who not only used scientific methods but asked the same questions as athletes and people trying to get fit. And then he gave them practical advice. Over the years, Dr. Costill has asked questions like, Why are some people so much better at certain sports than others? Is there an inborn physiological difference between, say, a sprinter and a marathon runner? How should people train to maximize their performance? Why does the body adapt with training? Now, at age 65, Dr. Costill is asking, Why do old people move so slowly? Can their muscles be trained to develop like those of someone younger? And what happens to the bodies of athletes as they grow old? In a way, Dr. Costill's career is an unlikely one, graced by close friendships with scientists and athletes and strange occurrences that got him into graduate school and got him his first real job, as head of the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State in 1966. Now semiretired -- he spends his mornings at Ball State and his afternoons building an airplane -- he no longer heads the lab, devoting himself to research and writing.
''Many of us in the field of pediatric endocrinology believe that it is premature to conclude that the normal age of puberty is occurring earlier,'' eight of them recently wrote in the journal Pediatrics. The danger, they said, is that if doctors assume that girls who start developing at 6 or 7 are normal, they might miss serious medical problems like tumors or genetic disorders that can cause early puberty. Early puberty can also decrease a girl's ultimate height. And some young girls have serious psychological and social difficulties when they start puberty at age 6 or 7. In addition, some pediatric endocrinologists also worry that doctors who dismiss such early development as normal might not tell the girls' parents that there is a safe, though expensive, drug that can temporarily halt their daughters' sexual development. Already, these critics say, some parents with legitimate concerns about their daughters' early development are being brushed off by pediatricians who believe puberty in the first or second grade is normal.
''For some reason or other, when we try to mature their eggs in the laboratory, it doesn't work,'' Dr. Kraemer said. ''Cat reproduction is just a lot more cooperative,'' he said. Lou Hawthorne, the chief executive of Genetic Savings and Clone, said cat cloning was almost an afterthought for the company. ''We had thought this was something that mostly dog owners would be interested in,'' Mr. Hawthorne said. But, he added, after the company heard from thousands of pet owners and did market research, it realized that the cat cloning market could be huge, with nearly as many people wanting to clone their cats as wanting to clone their dogs. For now, Mr. Hawthorne said, the company was storing tissue from cats and dogs, for a fee, so that owners could try to have their pets cloned in the future. He added that the company would consider trying to clone the cats of carefully selected customers.
As many as 7 percent of white women and a significant proportion of black women have two copies of a variant gene and are unable to activate tamoxifen. Others, with one copy of the variant gene, have a greatly reduced ability to activate it. ''These are huge effects -- 100-fold differences in activity,'' Dr. Flockhart said. He wonders, he said, if tamoxifen is restricted to responders whether it may actually be more effective than the newer drugs called aromatase inhibitors. Those drugs, unlike tamoxifen, are still under patent and are heavily marketed by their manufacturers as being 2 to 3 percent more effective than tamoxifen. But who will pay for such a comparative study? In the meantime, the evidence that the gene test could completely determine tamoxifen's clinical outcomes is not ironclad. ''We have one clinical trial that says it is the case,'' Dr. Flockhart said. Although there have been many clinical trials of tamoxifen, none collected DNA data. So it is impossible to go back, as Dr. Liggett and Dr. Bristow did, and ask if the gene test predicted whether a woman's cancer was more likely to recur if she could not activate tamoxifen.
''If you encounter one of these compounds, most of it is converted to less toxic material that is excreted,'' he continued. ''Only a tiny amount is converted to a form that could cause cancer. A small fraction of 1 percent gets converted. And people can differ enormously in their genetic ability to do these metabolic conversions.'' Further complicating the issue is that a person's diet, or components of the diet, can increase the activity of enzymes that convert chemicals into carcinogens. And other dietary components can inactivate enzymes that detoxify chemicals. The calculus grows so complex that it can be virtually impossible to predict what will happen in an individual person exposed to low levels of a possibly toxic chemical. For example, Dr. Wogan said, ''The same food, broccoli, can affect both types of enzymes.'' Added to this are the effects of chronic infections, like hepatitis B, in which the immune system releases chemicals that can magnify the effects of carcinogens.
The woman, who lives in Washington, asked not to be identified because she did not want her mother to know about her sex life. Her problem doctor was a new gynecologist she saw for a routine checkup. The doctor began the examination, inserting a speculum into the young woman's vagina. ''She asked if I was sexually active,'' the woman said. ''I said I was. She asked if I was sexually active at this moment. I said yes.'' Leaving the speculum in, and the woman with her feet in the stirrups, legs spread, the gynecologist walked to the head of the exam table and proceeded to lecture her on the perils of sexual activity outside of marriage. ''I was so humiliated and so scared,'' the woman said. ''And so embarrassed.'' Other times the doctor seems indifferent. That was the experience of Gloria Erlich, a writer who lives in Princeton, N.J., who saw a neurosurgeon for back pain. He told Mrs. Erlich she needed a myelogram, a scan of the spine that requires a spinal tap to inject dye into the spinal cord. She told him that she had had one, at his request, just a few months before and that the films should have been with her medical records. But the doctor said he could not locate them and asked her to have another one.
Dr. Brooke Herndon, an internist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, could not stop coughing. For two weeks starting in mid-April last year, she coughed, seemingly nonstop, followed by another week when she coughed sporadically, annoying, she said, everyone who worked with her. Before long, Dr. Kathryn Kirkland, an infectious disease specialist at Dartmouth, had a chilling thought: Could she be seeing the start of a whooping cough epidemic? By late April, other health care workers at the hospital were coughing, and severe, intractable coughing is a whooping cough hallmark. And if it was whooping cough, the epidemic had to be contained immediately because the disease could be deadly to babies in the hospital and could lead to pneumonia in the frail and vulnerable adult patients there. It was the start of a bizarre episode at the medical center: the story of the epidemic that wasn't. For months, nearly everyone involved thought the medical center had had a huge whooping cough outbreak, with extensive ramifications. Nearly 1,000 health care workers at the hospital in Lebanon, N.H., were given a preliminary test and furloughed from work until their results were in; 142 people, including Dr. Herndon, were told they appeared to have the disease; and thousands were given antibiotics and a vaccine for protection. Hospital beds were taken out of commission, including some in intensive care.
It's not that prevention doesn't work, and it's not that once someone has a heart attack there is little to be done. In fact, said Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute at the National Institutes of Health, age-adjusted death rates for heart disease dropped precipitously in the past few decades, and prevention and better treatment are major reasons why. But the concern, Dr. Nabel and others say, is that much more could be done. In many ways, scientists' hard-won and increasingly detailed understanding of what causes heart disease and what to do for it often goes unknown or ignored. Studies reveal, for example, that people have only about an hour to get their arteries open during a heart attack if they are to avoid permanent heart damage. Yet, recent surveys find, fewer than 10 percent get to a hospital that fast, sometimes because they are reluctant to acknowledge what is happening. And most who reach the hospital quickly do not receive the optimal treatment -- many American hospitals are not fully equipped to provide it but are reluctant to give up heart patients because they are so profitable.
She may feel she has a right to be concerned, Dr. Zigmond says, because they are her ideas, her work. But suppose she takes the notebooks and later wants to use some of the data in a paper she is publishing. Does she tell her former adviser? Does she put his name on the paper? What if she tells him and he says she cannot use the data? Or does she simply publish the data without her adviser's name on the paper? ''What's the ethics of that?'' Dr. Zigmond asks. ''We try to encourage students to ask what could she have done to prevent this sort of thing from happening,'' Dr. Zigmond said. ''Why is this news to the student, that her adviser considers her notebooks to be the property of the lab? We ask them how many have talked to their advisers about who owns their data. Almost no one.''
The message that it was impossible to pick out individuals most likely to be harmed or benefited by hormone replacement therapy was one that many doctors, researchers and drug company executives in the crowded meeting today did not welcome. In politely phrased questions in the public sessions and in heated discussions in hallways, many audience members repeatedly asked the scientists to explain. Some, like Dr. Otis Brawley, a cancer researcher from Emory University, said that many doctors and medical experts were being inconsistent. The Women's Health Initiative, he said, pointed to an excess risk of 8 new breast cancers per 10,000 women per year. Some women's doctors have told them that that risk is tiny. But, Dr. Brawley said, mammogram screening, at best, prevents one breast cancer death per year out of every 17,000 women over age 50 who are screened. The figure is even lower for women in their 40's -- one out of every 25,000. Yet doctors and public health officials have said mammograms are vitally important in the fight against breast cancer. They cannot have it both ways, Dr. Brawley said.
In surveys and focus groups, most Americans say they know what to do to protect themselves against osteoporosis, the disease of fragile bones that often occurs in the elderly: eat lots of calcium-rich foods or take a calcium supplement. Many say they are doing just that, or plan to. But this response worries osteoporosis researchers like Dr. Joan McGowan, chief of the musculoskeletal diseases branch at the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. Consuming calcium, she and others note, can at best make a small difference in osteoporosis risk, while other methods that can have a more substantial effect are often ignored. Dr. McGowan is one of two scientific editors of the surgeon general's report on bone health that was released last week. The report has an ambitious goal: to educate doctors and the public so that they can put into practice what researchers know about preventing and detecting the bone disease.
On the other hand, prostate cancer still kills about 30,000 men each year, making it the second leading cause of cancer death among men after lung cancer. Once the tumor spreads from the prostate, usually lodging in the bones, its progress cannot be stopped. ''Treatments can help for a while, but they certainly are not curative,'' Dr. Barry said. The treatments use drugs that block testosterone production because the hormone fuels the growth of the cancerous cells. But the drugs also cause impotence, a loss of bone and muscle mass, hot flashes and a general sense of apathy and malaise. Bone cancer can also be excruciatingly painful. So, once a small tumor is found, many men, understandably, elect to have their prostate gland destroyed, tumor and all. The diagnosis of prostate cancer can be devastating, often coming out of the blue, when the man feels fine and has no inkling that anything is amiss. Most men find out during a routine checkup, when they have a blood test called the P.S.A., which detects a protein, the prostate-specific antigen, whose levels can rise when cancer is present. A high level is followed by a biopsy to see if a cancerous tumor is present.
Interestingly, in some other cases of fraud, the senior scientist is the one caught unaware. In 1991, a graduate student at Georgetown University reported he had found a protein that signals a fertilized egg to start developing into an embryo. But the student, Mitchell Rosner, was caught faking an experiment and withdrew from the university. His co-authors retracted their paper and apologized. ''Scientists think fraud is only something that happens to other people,'' said Dr. Heinz Arnheiter, one of Mr. Rosner's collaborators, explaining why he was not suspicious. In 1981, at Cornell University, Dr. Efraim Racker, one of the grand old men of biochemistry, was taken in by a graduate student. Other scientists grew suspicious about the too-perfect data, but Dr. Racker first defended the papers he had published with his student. In the end, Dr. Racker retracted the publications and the student withdrew from Cornell. But he did not admit to fraud and Dr. Racker was not pilloried for co-authoring papers with him.
But the study, published today in The Journal of the American College of Cardiology, could not answer the question at the center of the fen-phen lawsuits: Did the valve damage occur after patients took the diet drugs or was it there all along? Dr. Richard Devereux, a cardiologist and expert on valve disease at  Weill College of Medicine of Cornell University, said that other studies had suggested that in some cases the damage had nothing to do with fen-phen but that estimates had varied as to how great that proportion is. Dr. Devereux, who was not involved in the Boston study, called today's study ''just one tile in the mosaic.'' ''It's reassuring news to some extent to people who've taken fen-phen,'' Dr. Devereux said. ''It should reassure them that their heart valves aren't going to be totally blown away by this stuff. It fits very well with my sense of things that this is not a devastating drug that's caused serious harm to a large number of people.''
Some scientists predict that the promise of stem cell research may encourage more couples to donate embryos for that purpose. ''I think that patients will come forward,'' said Dr. Alan DeCherney, a fertility expert at the University of California in Los Angeles and editor of the journal Fertility and Sterility. But that remains to be seen. At Columbia University's fertility center, only two patients so far have asked about donating frozen embryos for stem cell research. But, said Dr. Mark V. Sauer, the center's director, neither responded when asked for more information. At the Jones Institute in Virginia, where scientists are clearly interested in the work, no one has offered to donate embryos, Dr. Mayer said. But, he said, ''I did get an e-mail from another embryologist who indicated she had a patient who wanted to donate frozen embryos for stem cells.'' It was forwarded to him from the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology.
So leading scientists say they go around the country speaking at churches and synagogues, in community gatherings and at medical centers, hoping to explain stem cell research and its promise. And they anticipated Mr. Reagan's speech with shivers of thrill and anticipation. They knew that any misstep, any exaggeration, any error by someone as prominent as Ron Reagan, the former president's son, could end up hurting their cause. But the speech, said Dr. John Gearhart, director of the stem cell program at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, was all he could have wished. ''I certainly thought it was passionate,'' he said. Yet, he added, it also was accurate. ''I think he did a good job,'' Dr. Gearhart said. Mr. Reagan spoke of the stem cells as simply cells, with a potential to cure disease. ''They are not, in and of themselves, human beings,'' he said. He also spoke of a girl with diabetes, who put sequins on her insulin pump. She ''has learned to sleep through the blood drawings in the wee hours of the morning,'' and she knows what her future might hold -- ''blindness, amputation, diabetic coma.''
When he did the dehydration study, in 1970, marathon rules forbade runners to have fluids before they ran 10 kilometers, or 6.2 miles. Fluids were believed to be equivalent to performance-enhancing drugs. But runners were becoming seriously dehydrated, and some were collapsing with body temperatures as high as 104, 106 or even 109 degrees in a man who, miraculously, was not killed, Dr. Costill said. ''People would lose 12 pounds or more,'' he said. ''They would lose a gallon of fluid.'' The study did not show that Gatorade was any better than water for dehydration. But it did change marathon rules by documenting that runners were in dire need of fluids. As his research got going, Dr. Costill came back to his question about what, physiologically, makes a good distance runner. ''I wanted to find out why I was such a bad runner,'' Dr. Costill said. ''The best I ever did in a marathon was 3 hours and 15 minutes. I was training 70 miles a week, but I just couldn't get any better. I wanted to know what made those other guys so good.''
Dr. Suzanne Fletcher, a professor of ambulatory care and prevention at the Harvard Medical School, said that when she sees a new patient, she guesses the person's age before asking. One sure sign of ill health, Dr. Fletcher said, is looking much older than you are. ''I'm picking up on wrinkled skin and the color of the hair,'' Dr. Fletcher said. ''But it's really a brightness of movement as much as anything else. It's an expression of a face and the eyes, it's their alertness and understanding of what's going on around them. Almost any illness can affect these things, and they also are signals of what we call aging.'' But the hypothesis goes only so far. On an individual basis, there is no relationship between the prettiest person and the healthiest, according to S. Michael Kalick, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts at Boston, who has searched for an association to no avail.
One problem is expecting immediate results. ''It takes a lot of time to develop muscle,'' Dr. Kraemer said. ''Most people want to have it happen in the first few months, but it takes three months or longer, usually three to six months,'' before a person looks much different, he added. Forget the idea of spot reducing, researchers say, like ''toning'' the muscles of the inner thighs, for example, and slimming them. ''Spot reducing is not a real thing,'' Dr. Kraemer said. Many women also cling to a belief that is almost an act of faith among exercisers: muscle burns more calories than fat. Therefore weight lifting, by building muscle, will noticeably increase the body's metabolism. Sorry, said Dr. Bouchard, who is directing a national study on the genetic inheritance of an ability to train with aerobic exercises. He said that weight lifting had virtually no effect on resting metabolism. The reason is that any added muscle is minuscule compared with the total amount of skeletal muscle in the body. And muscle actually has a very low metabolic rate when it is at rest, which is most of the time.
Gerontologists say the full frailty syndrome is uncommon until people reach their 80's, but its likelihood increases rapidly from then on. For example, the Cardiovascular Health Study, a national study of more than 5,000 participants 65 and older, found that 9.5 percent of those 75 to 79 were frail. Among those 80 to 84, about 16 percent were frail, and nearly a quarter of those 85 to 89 had the frailty syndrome. ''I would say all 100-year-old people are frail,'' said Dr. Anne Newman, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of Pittsburgh. ''Most 90-year-olds are frail. And some 80-year-olds are frail.'' Dr. Newman and her colleagues wondered what could be causing frailty in some but not others. They thought of undetected cardiovascular disease. The idea was that blood flow to the heart or muscle or brain could be impeded even if a person had had no overt signs of cardiovascular disease.
Researchers estimate that just one of those tactics, lowering cholesterol to what guidelines suggest, can reduce the risk of heart attack by a third but is followed by only 20 percent of heart patients. ''It's amazing and it's completely backwards in terms of prioritization,'' said Dr. David Brown, an interventional cardiologist at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. Heart experts say they understand why the disconnect occurred: they, too, at first found it hard to believe what research was telling them. For years, they were wedded to the wrong model of heart disease. ''There has been a culture in cardiology that the narrowings were the problem and that if you fix them the patient does better,'' said Dr. David Waters, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco. The old idea was this: Coronary disease is akin to sludge building up in a pipe. Plaque accumulates slowly, over decades, and once it is there it is pretty much there for good. Every year, the narrowing grows more severe until one day no blood can get through and the patient has a heart attack. Bypass surgery or angioplasty -- opening arteries by pushing plaque back with a tiny balloon and then, often, holding it there with a stent -- can open up a narrowed artery before it closes completely. And so, it was assumed, heart attacks could be averted.
Some osteoporosis experts, like Dr. Siris, follow guidelines issued by the National Osteoporosis Foundation (www.nof.org). She focuses on women and looks at other factors besides bone density. Did the woman have any fractures after menopause? That greatly increases her risk. Does she smoke? Is she small and thin? Does she have a family history of osteoporosis? Is she taking drugs like corticosteroids that suppress the immune system and can increase her risk? Dr. Siris suggests bone density screening for 50-year-old women with additional risk factors for osteoporosis and tells others they can wait until they are 60 or 65. ''You've got to have a strategy for dealing with this huge mass of women,'' Dr. Siris said. ''What do you do?''
Even as the scientists spoke of what might lie ahead, some drew back, nervous about public reaction and stung by previous experiences after they voiced their opinions. Dr. Campisi of Berkeley said she recently gave a public lecture on aging on her campus. Afterward, she said, ''a number of people came up to me and said: 'How dare you do this research? The earth is already being raped by too many people, there is so much garbage, so much pollution.' '' ''I was really quite taken aback,'' Dr. Campisi said. ''It was a small group but they just about nailed me to the wall.'' The scientists also feared being tainted with the stain of hucksterism. ''This group is sensitive to the inflated claims that have been made in the past,'' said Dr. Steven Austad, a professor of zoology at the University of Idaho. ''That makes us hesitant. We don't want to follow in this long line of people who say, 'Take this potion and do my exercises and you can live to be 150.' ''
A previous study, however, had found that folate helped such patients. Dr. Eric Topol, an interventional cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, said he thought the truth was that it was neither helpful nor harmful for most people. ''Over all, the likely explanation is that there is a neutral effect, and these relatively small trials found opposite findings due to the play of chance,'' he said. Dr. Topol said B vitamins, like folic acid, ''can't be recommended'' at this point, except for people with extremely low levels of homocysteine, and even then their value has not been rigorously demonstrated. Karen Miller-Kovach, chief scientist for Weight Watchers International, has a compromise. She takes a child's multivitamin, with its much lower levels of vitamins and minerals. ''It is virtually impossible to find an adult multivitamin and mineral supplement that is only 100 percent of the R.D.A.,'' Ms. Miller-Kovach said. ''All are 150 percent or so. I worry about getting too much and I worry about imbalances. They put in more of the things that are inexpensive, like B vitamins and things with consumer appeal like vitamin C. The formulas are based on market forces, not nutritional needs.''
Dashing the hopes of many doctors, a large national study has found that contrary to some preliminary research, a simple step -- lowering  the temperature of the brain -- did not help patients with severe head injuries. Medical researchers said the study was important because of its  findings, and was a milestone in the way it was conducted. Because the study required quick treatment of comatose patients with serious head injuries, the researchers were not always able to find family members in time to obtain their permission. Instead, they enrolled many patients under a novel ''waived consent'' policy that the government adopted to allow research on humans to be done ethically without prior permission. The study, by Dr. Guy L. Clifton of the University of Texas-Houston Medical School and colleagues, is being reported today in The New England Journal of Medicine. It involved 392 patients ages 16 to 65 who arrived at emergency rooms with severe head injuries.
Dr. Gallo added that cancer was a complex disease. ''There is a gene and environment interaction, and the environment is much broader than just chemicals,'' he said. ''The challenge is to figure out what is the role of the gene and how does the lifestyle and environment overlay that gene.'' And science, he said, is just not there yet. Preventing Cancer Previous articles in this series explored whether diet, exercise and stress matter in prevention. A final one will look at the role of genetics. The series remains online, and Gina Kolata discusses cancer and environment in a video feature: nytimes.com/science Preventing Cancer Correction:  December 20, 2005, Tuesday  An article in Science Times last Tuesday about the question of links between cancer and the environment misstated the name of an advocacy group in San Francisco whose director urged the use of the least toxic alternatives to chemicals that may cause cancer. It is Breast Cancer Action, not the Breast Cancer Action Coalition.
Other patients have had very emotional reactions to the drugs. One woman who had come in on Monday afternoon was 70 years old and had been taking hormones for 30 years. The few times she had tried to stop taking them, her menopause symptoms had returned. ''I said, 'Don't you think you've been on it long enough?' '' Dr. Utian said. ''She said: 'Why would I come off it? I'd rather be dead.' ''
Hexamethonium, however, is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Dr. Togias reported to the institutional review board, or I.R.B., an ethics group overseeing his work, that had concluded that the drug's main risk was in causing a temporary drop in blood pressure. His conclusions were reflected in a consent form signed by Ms. Roche and the other study volunteers. That form ''should not have been approved'' by the institutional review board, the Hopkins investigating committee concluded. The form did not mention that hexamethonium was not approved by the F.D.A., and it did not say that the drug's safety was uncertain or that the only data on the safety of inhaling it came from the experience of just 20 people. In addition, the committee found that Dr. Togias had apparently missed some papers suggesting that the drug might injure the lungs. ''The majority of the committee believed that the I.R.B. should have required more evidence of safety in the use of hexamethonium,'' the report says.
''I hope that doctor sitting out there reads the report and remembers all the people he pushed this on,'' Ms. Balaban said. Yet some women, well aware of the risks of hormones, say it is not so easy for them to simply throw the drugs away. Nancy Richardson, 60, of Wayland, Mass., said she resisted taking Prempro. When she entered menopause at age 52, she tried waiting for the drenching night sweats to go away, she tried what she called ''useless homeopathic things,'' and then she gave up and tried Prempro. She has been unable go off it despite repeated efforts to taper down her dose. Every time she got down to no drug at all, her disabling menopause symptoms came roaring back. She is trying again now, with the help of Dr. Marcie Richardson (no relation), a menopause specialist at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a group practice in Boston. And if it does not work, she said, she has made her peace with the drug.
The screening guidelines ''either have not been heard or have been ignored,'' the investigators wrote. When a woman does not have a cervix, a doctor scrapes cells from her vagina instead, sending them off to be examined. And that, cancer experts say, is problematic. Vaginal cancer is exceedingly rare, and tests of vaginal cells are much more likely to result in false positives than they are to find vaginal cancers. A result is unnecessary vaginal biopsies that can result in their own false positives. As a result, women can end up having vaginal tissue removed to treat a cancer that is not even present. Dr. Alfred Berg, chairman of the department of family medicine at the University of Washington and the former chairman of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which issues medical practice guidelines, said Pap tests in women without a cervix had been ''a longstanding issue.'' Since 1988, Dr. Berg said, the task force has issued more and more adamant statements against it, to little avail.
Diane Raymond of Columbia, S.C., was just 45 when she started taking Prempro, the most popular hormone therapy for menopause. Ms. Raymond had not yet entered menopause, but her doctor encouraged her to take the drug anyway. His words, she recalls, were, ''We'll keep the wolves from the door, so when you do go into menopause, the transition will be much smoother.'' Four and a half years later, she developed breast cancer, and her doctor told her to stop the Prempro. Immediately. Since then, Ms. Raymond, now 60, has closely followed the developing news about Prempro and breast cancer. In 2002 when a large study, the Women's Health Initiative, concluded that Prempro could slightly increase the risk of breast cancer, she decided that maybe it was too soon to start thinking, ''What if I'd never taken Prempro?'' But the news last Friday was different, so vivid and immediate that it hit home.
It is a complication hardly dreamed of in the 1980's, when cancer researchers triumphantly announced that many women with small tumors did not need to have mastectomies. But then again, the large national study that established this, like nearly every other cancer study until now, had virtually no patients over 65. Now, in what they say is an unprecedented initiative, cancer researchers are designing studies specifically for older people. The new approach, these researchers say, is forcing them to ask a different sort of question. Instead of seeking the most aggressive treatments, intended to keep cancer at bay for decades, they are looking for the mildest treatments for people whose life expectancy may be no more than 10 years. That means asking whether radiation after lumpectomy extends life for older women with breast cancer, whether chemotherapy is helpful for elderly patients with colon cancer, lung cancer or breast cancer, and whether a mild chemotherapy treatment is helpful for elderly lung-cancer patients.
Dr. R. Rodney Howell, a professor of pediatrics at the Leonard M. Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami and the chairman of both the committee that wrote the report and the federal advisory group, agreed. ''Do I feel it will be difficult for physicians and caretakers to deal with this?'' Dr. Howell said. ''The answer is yes. But I just don't think it is proper for us to have information about an abnormality without conveying it.'' But Dr. Lainie Friedman Ross, a pediatrician and medical ethicist at the University of Chicago, said: ''We don't know if they are medical conditions. We don't know what to do with the information. Reporting test data for which there are no systems in place for follow-up testing and treatment is not rejecting paternalism, but it is patient abandonment.'' In any event, Dr. Howell said, noting that states were plunging into testing programs: ''It's not really a question of, 'Should we expand newborn screening?' It's happening. It's going like a house on fire.''
But basically their health outcomes are about the same as ours. If you take as your first cut, Do we live longer? Do we have less morbidity? Do we have less disability? The answer is no. It's about the same. Medical care is one thing, health is something else. I've been doing research in this field since 1965 and I almost invariably find that the health of people has little to do with the quality or quantity of health care. There are some areas in the United States that have twice as many physicians per capita as other areas. There is no evidence that that shows up in the health of the population -- none whatsoever. Some areas in the U.S. have medical schools and some areas don't have medical schools. There is a widespread belief in the academic medical community that the presence of a medical school raises the standard of care -- people are closer to the frontiers of medicine, the doctors there can go to the grand rounds. I don't find any evidence whatsoever that having a medical school in an area produces lower mortality rates. Nor is it true that we're any sicker now from all this managed care and denial of services and so on.
Yet there also is opposition and there are ethical questions. The Humane Society of the United States issued a statement yesterday objecting to the cloning of pets, saying ''it serves no compelling social purpose and it threatens to add to the pet overpopulation problem.'' Dr. Caplan said he had two concerns. ''Are you preying on grief and desperation that pet owners often have when they lose a pet to promise them something more than cloning can deliver?'' he asked. If cloning creates animals that suffer and die young, he added, can it be justified? While some cloned animals have grown up to be perfectly normal, others have died in  infancy of severe medical problems like lung and heart defects. A variety of animals, including sheep, goats, cows, mice and pigs, have been cloned. The cloned cat, called cc, for carbon copy, is a genetically identical copy of a 2-year-old female cat, Rainbow, that was not anyone's pet. But Rainbow and cc do not look alike, illustrating that identical twin cats may not have identical coats.
Clearly, many are not waiting. The academy, which began with 12 doctors in 1993, now has 8,000 physician members in the United States, Dr. Klatz said. The treatment is expensive: $1,000 a month for the panoply of drugs and dietary supplements, including human growth hormone and testosterone for men and women, estrogen and progesterone for women (the doctors say their ''bioidentical'' hormones are safe), melatonin, DHEA, vitamins and antioxidants. The unlikely hero of today's anti-aging movement was Dr. Daniel Rudman, an academic researcher at the Medical College of Wisconsin who asked if he could reverse the effects of aging by giving growth hormone to elderly men. Aging people, he noted, lose muscle and put on fat, their skin thins and their bones weaken. At the same time, growth hormone levels steadily decline. He observed that the effects of aging also appeared in young people who lacked growth hormone for medical reasons.
In the study published today, researchers from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center &amp; Research Institute in Tampa, Fla., the Instituto Tumori in Milan, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center screened and analyzed data from 3,246 people with no symptoms of lung cancer. All were smokers or had smoked for an average of 39 years. And all were screened with CT scans. The scans detected lung cancer in 144 people. That, the researchers calculated, is 300 percent more than would be expected without screening. And there was a concomitant 1,000 percent increase in surgical treatment. But, they note, the number who died from lung cancer -- 38 -- was about the same as it would have been without screening. The researchers used a statistical model to estimate the expected number of cancers and the expected death rate without screening. One reason more cancers were found and treated but the death rate was the same, researchers propose, is that screening led to the detection and treatment of cancers that did not need to be treated -- they would not have grown enough in the person's lifetime to cause any harm. And many of the deadly cancers that were treated still ended up killing patients.
There is little doubt that computerized offices can help. For instance, Dr. Kevin Toppenberg recently saw an emergency patient who had injured his leg at the beach and arrived at his office wincing in pain. The patient's regular doctor, one of Dr. Toppenberg's 14 colleagues, practiced in another of the group's three offices in Greeneville, Tenn., and was taking the day off. In a typical medical practice, the man's records would ordinarily be in a paper file in his own doctor's office and a colleague in another office would have no way of getting them. Dr. Toppenberg, like many other doctors, would rather send such a patient to an emergency room than see him without a medical record. ''To just be working blind is scary for doctors,'' Dr. Toppenberg said. But Dr. Toppenberg's newly installed computer program let him see the man's record immediately, on a computer screen. After examining the man and diagnosing a probable torn muscle, Dr. Toppenberg sent him to an orthopedist. Then Dr. Toppenberg added his findings to the man's record so his colleague would have them instantly when he needed to consult them.
''It comes down to taking over someone's complications,'' she said. ''Does that mean I'm putting my doctor on call in the middle of the night. We might say, 'Go to the emergency room.' '' Dr. Warren Hern, director of the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado, worries about that, too. ''What's going to happen if the emergency room doctor takes care of the patient and perforates the uterus?'' he asked. ''Who's responsible?'' Some say that the driving force that will bring mifepristone to private doctors' offices will be women who demand it. ''This will not be physician driven; it will be patient driven,'' said Dr. Carole Joffe, a visiting professor of sociology at Bryn Mawr College, outside Philadelphia. And all agreed that women seemed interested in the drug. Vicki Saporta, executive director of the National Abortion Federation, said so many women were calling about mifepristone that the group had to double the capacity of its hot line. ''We get over 3,000 calls a month, and it's increasing,'' she said.
But all agree on the need for the research. More and more middle-aged and elderly men are taking testosterone, believing it can restore the vitality of youth, improve mood and memory and increase sexual drive. The Institute of Medicine report says that more than 1.75 million prescriptions were written in 2002, up from 648,000 in 1999. Researchers at the National Institute on Aging were concerned that the testosterone boom was a public health issue and wanted a large clinical trial. Those at the National Cancer Institute worried about giving healthy men testosterone in such a study when it might fuel the growth of prostate cancer. Last year, the heads of the two institutes asked the Institute of Medicine for help. ''They felt like they were in a quandary, and they were not certain what steps should be taken,'' said Dr. Dan G. Blazer, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University and chairman of the Institute of Medicine's committee.
Instead, he and other experts say, the first generation of antidepressants was discovered by accident. Though a few came on the market based on clinical tests showing they could help patients, animal tests were later developed to speed the discovery of other drugs. The idea was for pharmaceutical companies to use animal testing to screen thousands of potential new compounds to pick out those most likely to work in clinical tests on depressed patients. The problem, some researchers say, is that while the animal tests work fine for identifying promising new drugs, they do not mimic anything like human depression. For one thing, animals respond to the drugs within half an hour, while depressed patients need weeks before feeling their effects. Another difference is that antidepressants affect different parts of the brain in animals and humans. ''Depression has a strong emotional and cognitive component,'' Dr. Schatzberg said. ''People feel sad, worthless, guilty.''
''It's a significant concern,'' said Dr. Peter N. Schlegel, a specialist in  male infertility at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. But he noted that most of the monkey embryos did not take up the genes that Dr. Schatten attached to the sperm. Dr. Paul Turek, a specialist in  male infertility at the University of California in San Francisco, says he will add the new information from the monkey experiments when he is counseling patients who are considering ICSI. ''They can decide whether they want to go forward or not,'' he said. But Dr. Turek added that while he would continue with ICSI for those who want it, he would not give a blanket recommendation to everything that becomes technologically possible just because there is a market for it. ''I fall back on the fact that I am an ethical religious man,'' he said. As such, he said, he continually questions where the boundaries lie.
In a culmination of concerted efforts initiated by one determined family, three groups of researchers are reporting that they have found the gene mutation that causes a rare disorder known as pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The discovery is being published today in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and on June 1 in two papers in Nature Genetics. The investigators say the gene, known as ABCC6, directs cells to make a protein that is similar to others, known as ABC transporters, that shuttle small molecules in and out of cells. Now that they have identified the gene, they say, they can begin figuring out how it contributes to disease, diagnose it prenatally, test for it in people whose symptoms are ambiguous and look for ways to treat the disease. The search for the gene had its origins in 1994, when a puzzled mother took her 6-year-old daughter to a dermatologist to ask about a persistent rash on the little girl's neck.
''Why do some regions spend more?'' Dr. Skinner asked. ''I don't think there's very good scientific evidence on when to stop. In some areas they just keep working until the very last minute.'' The Dartmouth group recently asked the same questions about medical care at the start of life, in its study on the relationship between supplies of newborn intensive care specialists and the death rate among infants in the United States. The reason for focusing on high-risk newborns, Dr. Fisher said, is that an infant's birth weight is an excellent indicator of the baby's risk of death. That allowed the researchers to compare outcomes for similar babies in regions with more, or fewer, newborn intensive care beds. The result, they reported in May in The New England Journal of Medicine, was that the specialists were not distributed according to need. Regions with more low-birth-weight babies actually had fewer specialists.
Those runners, he added, have their own water stations, the elite water stops, where they have their own sports drinks that they have chosen in advance. Instead, Dr. Martin said, the problem is with slower runners, who may take as long as nine hours to run a race. They may be running with groups of friends, raising money for a favorite charity. Or they may be tourist runners, people who plan vacations around marathons. ''We're worried about this increasingly large group of people, taking courses in how to run a marathon, going to shoe shops to learn how to run,'' Dr. Martin said. ''What has been told to them is the party line. Make sure you drink. You can't drink too much. Carry water with you or you will get dehydrated. Don't worry about heat, just drink more. That's wrong. It's wrong, wrong, wrong.'' What about the risks of dehydration, leading to heatstroke as the body temperature soars? Grossly exaggerated, medical experts say. Most athletes who collapse at the finish line suffer from postural hypotension, a drop in blood pressure when blood pools in the legs, and not from heatstroke.
The debate over mammograms began in the 80's, when the National Cancer Institute questioned their benefits for women in their 40's. In 2002, the British journal Lancet published a paper saying the benefits of mammograms for women of any age were unclear. One group, the P.D.Q., an independent group that analyzes data for the National Cancer Institute to present to the public, said it could no longer tell women that mammograms prevented breast cancer deaths. That group, of which Dr. Harris is a member, said the clinical trials of mammograms had not made a strong case that lives were saved. Just because a cancer is found early, the group added, does not mean that the patient is necessarily better off. Some cancers are curable, no matter when they are found. Others are incurable, no matter when they are found. To know that a screening test works, experts need strong evidence from clinical trials, and the evidence from the mammography trials was just not convincing to them.
Dr. Andrew Taussig of Florida Hospital in Orlando said that if there were problems they were almost certainly due to doctor error. ''It's not the stent,'' Dr. Taussig said. Dr. John Hodgson of Emory University, who is president of the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, cautioned against making too much of isolated reports. ''I would not be alarmed by a few reports,'' Dr. Hodgson said. ''Those same things have happened with previous generations of stents and balloons.''
Then there was the case of Marlo Brown of Petaluma, Calif. In the early 1980's, Ms. Brown noticed that several cats in a shelter that she ran were ill with a disease that looked to her like AIDS. She took the cats and detailed notes to an animal virologist at the University of California at Davis and suggested that they had a feline version of AIDS and that he use their tissue to find the virus. He did, and ended up discovering not only a feline AIDS virus but also a test for it and a vaccine to protect cats. The University of California obtained patents on the test and the vaccine. But, Ms. Brown asked, what about her? Was she not an inventor too? A Federal District Court said in the mid-1990's that she was not, ruling that her contribution did not entitle her to share in the patent.
Ms. Buchanan said that sort of care made all the difference for her. After learning she had cancer, she decided to have both breasts removed. She had a strong family history of breast cancer and was terrified that she might get cancer in her other breast. And she decided to have breast reconstruction at the same time as her mastectomies. Dr. Dultz and Dr. Marc Alan Drimmer, a Princeton plastic surgeon, did the operation. ''When I woke up after the surgery, she was holding my left hand and he was holding my right hand,'' Ms. Buchanan said. ''When I think about it, it makes me want to cry.''
IN the old days, nearly two decades ago, when Jeffrey Harrison was selling his sperm to California Cryobank, sperm banks did not tell clients much. Women learned that Donor 150 (Mr. Harrison, who was one of the bank's most-requested donors) was six feet tall, had blue eyes and was interested in philosophy, music and drama. But they did not learn, for instance, that despite those interests, Mr. Harrison was also ''sort of a free spirit,'' as Danielle, one of his donor-conceived daughters, said after finding him last week. Mr. Harrison, 50, lives in a recreational vehicle near Los Angeles, eking out a living doing odd jobs and taking care of dogs. While the women who used his sperm may be perfectly satisfied, women today seem to be looking for a more unquestionably accomplished sort of man. Handsome and brilliant. Talented and charming. Loving and kind. A match one might only dream of finding in the flesh.
The idea of the annual physical took off in the 1920's, when life insurance companies issued data widely interpreted to mean that people who had checkups lived longer. A likelier interpretation is that people who had the checkups were healthier to begin with because they took better care of themselves, said Dr. Frame, a member of the task force. Instead, doctors leaped to the assumption ''that the reason for better health was the annual physical,'' he said. In New York City, Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, an ethicist and internist at St. Vincent's Hospital, worries about over-testing. ''At the very beginning there's such a fear of missing something. But with experience, one recognizes that, hey, if we hadn't found that bright object in the M.R.I. we shouldn't have done, maybe that patient wouldn't have had that catastrophic bleed into his brain for the biopsy we did to find nothing.'' But some patients who had what evidence-based medicine deems unnecessary tests say they are glad they did.
In the meantime, surgeons say, there is a danger in overselling the technique before it can be systematically tested, especially since the work is being supported by two small robot companies that, even surgeons involved acknowledge, have financial pressures to be upbeat and enthusiastic. One, Intuitive Surgical, in Mountain View, Calif., is trying to go public. The other, Computer Motion Inc., of Goleta, Calif, went public in August 1997. Dr. Wolf and other surgeons who are doing the operations say they have no stock or stock options and no direct financial stakes in the companies. Still, they confess they are a bit nervous about the mix of business and science. ''We're going to proceed in an orderly fashion, with no cowboys,'' Dr. Wolf said. Dr. Wolf and others stress that today's robots are not yet good enough to take over most heart surgery. The robots cost about a million dollars and are suitable only for the 15 percent of patients who have just one blocked coronary artery, in the front of their hearts.
Two widely used nutritional supplements for arthritis pain do not effectively soothe patients' aching arthritic knees, a large federal study has found. The study of the two drugs, glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, was published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. The study was meant to provide a definitive answer to a question that has baffled doctors and patients alike: do these supplements work? Americans spent an estimated $734 million on glucosamine and chondroitin in 2004, according to The Nutrition Business Journal, making them among the most widely used dietary supplements in the nation. The two, which are produced by numerous companies, are often sold in combination as a treatment for arthritis. In the 24-week study, 1,583 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee were randomly assigned to one of five groups. Some patients took glucosamine, some took chondroitin and some took both. Others, serving as comparison subjects, took a placebo or celecoxib, sold as Celebrex, a prescription drug that is approved for osteoarthritis.
What should be done, Dr. Lerner said, is ''sitting back and trying to analyze how we as patients, as doctors, as a society, should deal with these conflicting data.'' That is an issue that is plaguing some advocacy groups. The report ''is really causing a huge amount of concern among activists,'' said Cindy Pearson, the executive director of the National Women's Health Network. She said her group no longer advocates self-examination. Now, she said, if mammograms are not useful, ''you're just left out there with nothing.'' Fran Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, said she welcomed the mammography dispute. ''We know that mammography screening has serious limitations, yet it has been sold as the be-all and end-all for breast cancer,'' Ms. Visco said. ''When someone says, 'We have to question that assumption,' we're thrilled. We've been questioning it from the beginning.'' ''I'm not ready to tell women over 50 not to get screened,'' Ms. Visco said. ''But what we are telling women is that we don't have a good screening test to detect breast cancer early and we're not sure what to do when we find it early.'' It is time, she said, to focus on these issues rather than assume that mammograms are the answer.
But maybe, some physiologists and cardiologists are saying, the textbooks are wrong. The question of how to find maximum heart rates is not just of academic interest, medical experts say. The formula for calculating the maximum rate has become a standard in cardiology and in fitness programs, and an entire industry has grown up around it, with monitors sold to individuals and built into exercise equipment. ''There is a need, a clinical and societal need, to estimate the maximum heart rate,'' said Dr. Douglas Seals, an exercise physiologist at the University of Colorado. Doctors use the formula when they test patients for heart disease, asking them to walk on treadmills while the speed and incline are gradually increased until their heart rates reach 85 percent of the predicted maximums. The idea is to look for signs, like chest pain or a sudden drop in the heart rate, indicating that the heart is not getting enough blood. But if doctors underestimate how fast the person's heart can beat, they may stop the test too soon, Dr. Seals noted.
A new and emerging understanding of how heart attacks occur indicates that increasingly popular aggressive treatments may be doing little or nothing to prevent them. The artery-opening methods, like bypass surgery and stents, the widely used wire cages that hold plaque against an artery wall, can alleviate crushing chest pain. Stents can also rescue someone in the midst of a heart attack by destroying an obstruction and holding the closed artery open. But the new model of heart disease shows that the vast majority of heart attacks do not originate with obstructions that narrow arteries. Instead, recent and continuing studies show that a more powerful way to prevent heart attacks in patients at high risk is to adhere rigorously to what can seem like boring old advice -- giving up smoking, for example, and taking drugs to get blood pressure under control, drive cholesterol levels down and prevent blood clotting.
At the heart of its decisions, the F.D.A. says, are straightforward scientific and medical questions. Is there a low potential for abuse or misuse? Can consumers use it for self-diagnosed conditions? Can the drug be adequately labeled? Are doctors needed for its safe and effective use? Doctors themselves regularly play a large role in the F.D.A.'s deliberations. Take the case of a prescription asthma drug called metaproterenol. William Vodra, a former associate chief counsel for drugs at the F.D.A., said that in the early 1980's the agency tried to convert the drug to over-the-counter status. The agency's experts said it was safer and more effective than a similar over-the-counter drug, and if a patient was having an attack, there might not be time to get a doctor's prescription. But doctors objected, recalled Mr. Vodra, a lawyer who today represents drug companies. ''Pediatric allergists said it was a terrible idea,'' he said. ''They said they had their patients call them every time they took a spritz from the inhaler. They feared that the drugs would be used instead of hospitalization when serious attacks occurred.''
South Korean researchers are reporting today that they have developed a highly efficient recipe for producing human embryos through cloning, and then extracting their stem cells. Writing in the journal Science, the researchers, led by Dr. Woo Suk Hwang and Dr. Shin Yong Moon of Seoul National University, said they used their method to produce 11 human stem cell lines that were genetic matches of patients who ranged in age from 2 to 56. The method, called therapeutic cloning, is one of the great hopes of the stem cell field. It produces stem cells, universal cells that are extracted from embryos, killing the embryos in the process, and that, in theory, can be directed to grow into any of the body's cell types. Because the stem cells come from embryos that are clones of individuals, they would be exact genetic matches and less likely to be rejected by a patient's immune system. Scientists want to obtain such stem cells from patients with certain disorders and illnesses to study the origin of diseases and to develop replacement cells that would be identical to those a patient has lost in a disease like Parkinson's.
The question of how much medical care is enough ''is a major issue that we need to start addressing head on,'' Dr. Grumbach said in a recent interview. The accumulating data, he said, ''makes you question what we're getting for this phenomenal investment in health care.''
Now, the mixed news about Vioxx raises questions of risk and benefit that science simply cannot answer. There is increasing evidence that not just Vioxx but similar drugs, like Celebrex and Bextra, made by Pfizer, might increase the risk of heart problems. But the risks of Vioxx and Celebrex came to light only because they were tested in long-term studies to see if they could prevent cancer. And if drugs like this do prevent cancer, which risk is worse, cancer if you do not take them, or heart attacks if you do? Who decides? In the meantime, scientists say they are reeling from the discouraging news about drugs once thought to hold so much promise. First Vioxx was withdrawn from the market. Then, last week, Celebrex turned out to increase the risk of heart attacks in a similar colon polyp prevention study. (Those polyp data have not yet been analyzed.) Bextra, it turned out, increased heart attack risk in patients who had had heart surgery. And on Monday, even Aleve, the over-the-counter pain reliever, fell under suspicion. In a study asking whether it or Celebrex could prevent Alzheimer's disease, Aleve patients had a 50 percent greater rate of heart problems, which is a small increase that may not be statistically significant. The study was halted anyway, in today's atmosphere of extreme caution.
Should diabetes specialists even bother to advise patients to try helping themselves through diet and exercise first, before prescribing drugs? A large federal study, completed several years ago, seemed to make a compelling case that they should. A third of its 3,234 participants were assigned to a low-fat, low-calorie diet and told to exercise for 150 minutes a week. The others were given a placebo or were given metformin, a diabetes drug available as an inexpensive generic. After an average of three years, just 14.1 percent of those in the diet and exercise group had developed diabetes. In contrast, 28.9 percent of participants taking the placebo had diabetes, and 21.7 percent of those taking metformin. But the diet and exercise program was nothing like what an ordinary person might expect. The participants got extensive individual counseling and group support, at a cost of $1,356 a person the first year and $672 in each subsequent year. Even so, they shed only about 12 pounds after four years, or 4 percent of their initial weight. Most were continuing with their exercise program, though. If a large health plan decided to offer the same program for its members at risk for diabetes, the plan's price for every member would rise by 1 percent, said Dr. David Eddy, the medical director of Archimedes Inc., a health care consulting company. Over 30 years, 61 percent of the people at risk would develop diabetes, as compared with 72 percent if no such program were instituted.
But, Mr. Vodra said, a study in inner-city Baltimore found that over half of all asthmatics got their prescriptions from hospital emergency rooms, and no doctor was regularly following their use of these drugs. Nonetheless, metaproterenol stayed a prescription drug. If the morning-after pill were sold over the counter, doctors who opposed the change said at the F.D.A. hearing, teenagers would avoid counseling on responsible sexual behavior. Some also said that making the drug over the counter would interfere with their relationship with their patients. Those favoring the change said that teenagers are going to have unprotected sex in any case and needed a safe way to avoid pregnancy. In other cases, straightforward commercial considerations can determine how a company wants a drug classified. For example, drug manufacturers know that patients with drug coverage often prefer prescriptions to paying the full cost of over-the-counter drugs. Doctors say they see this insurance effect all the time. Dr. James Osborne, an internist in Greensboro, N.C., says when patients with occasional heartburn ask for a prescription for Nexium, he often suggests they buy Pepsid, which costs 24 cents a day for the four pills needed to equal prescription strength, or about 17 times less than Nexium. ''They say, 'It doesn't matter, doc. I have a drug card,''' Dr. Osborne said.
Researchers turned to DNA vaccines for AIDS only after years of trying to make traditional vaccines to elicit antibodies to the AIDS virus. Traditional vaccines are made of proteins from microorganisms like viruses or bacteria or are made of killed or disabled microorganisms. They stimulate the immune system to make antibodies, which attach  themselves to the disease-causing organisms and block them. The problem with making such a vaccine against AIDS was that the virus had only one target for an antibody -- a protein that protruded from the virus's slick fatty surface. Although vaccinated people made antibodies to that protein, the antibodies were all but useless because the virus mutated constantly, altering its surface protein and evading the antibodies. That observation led some scientists to consider exploiting other ways that the immune system could attack the AIDS virus. They knew that when a monkey, or a person, was infected with an AIDS virus, there was an initial burst of viral replication when levels of the virus in the body shot up. Then the immune system tamps the virus down, containing the infection often for years during which there is no sign of illness. Finally, though, the virus breaks free, replicating wildly and causing sickness and death.
''People were using modified kitchen spoons and forks,'' Dr. Charlesworth said. ''They would cut off the middle tines and bend it at a right angle.'' Some situations seemed impossible, like sewing blood vessels onto the back of the heart. ''You had to lift the heart to get to the back of it, and then the blood pressure would drop,'' Dr. Subramanian said. But by around 2000, he said, instrument makers had solved many of the problems. ''By 2001, a lot of people were doing four vessel and five vessel bypasses,'' he said. He and his colleagues are among them. Their intention, he said, is to do every bypass without the pump. The more experience he has, the less often he has to resort to the heart-lung machine. Now, Dr. Subramanian said, only about 1 percent of his patients end up on the machine and then only if he encounters a problem during surgery.
In a CT scan, X-rays pass through the heart and are picked up by detectors that send information to a computer that constructs an image. The more detectors, the greater the resolution. G.E., for example, says it will install several of its 64-detector machines in medical centers by the end of the year and several hundred by the end of 2005. The Cleveland Clinic just got a 40-detector machine, made by Philips. Siemens has already installed 20 of its newest machines in the United States, including one at the New York University Medical Center. Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan has several new machines made by different companies, ''to encourage competition,'' said Dr. Valentin Fuster, a cardiologist there. Yet some heart experts see trouble ahead. For example, the scans identify narrowed coronary arteries in people with no symptoms of heart disease, like chest pains. Once a narrowing is detected, many doctors and most patients want to fix it, inserting a stent or doing bypass surgery -- even though research shows such actions will not prevent heart attacks in such patients.
When patients come to the University of Virginia Health System to have an abnormal heart rhythm diagnosed or treated, they are told that doctors will be threading thin wires through their veins directly into their heart. They learn that they run a slight risk of infection, or of damage to the heart, lungs or blood vessels from the very nature of the invasive procedure. But there is one thing they are not told: although the catheters and wires are labeled ''single use only,'' they may have been used before. They have been cleaned and sterilized, but they have spent time in someone else's blood vessels and heart. In hospitals and clinics around the nation, these devices and others -- biopsy needles used to extract tissue, tiny scissors used to cut out tissue in patients' gastrointestinal tracts, wires or balloons that go into the coronary arteries or the heart itself -- are being reused more and more often despite their labeling.
Until now, research on hepatitis C has focused on patients who sought help from liver specialists. Often, they were the sickest patients, suffering from liver failure or liver cancer. Their experience shows how serious hepatitis C infections can be. But researchers have no idea if they are typical. Other studies have traced the virus and its effects in people who were infected through contaminated blood about two decades ago. In those studies, very few infected people turned out to be sick, but that might be because the studies have not gone on long enough or because patients who might have gotten liver disease died first of the diseases that led to the transfusion. It seemed there was no way to learn the true picture, since no one knew how to find people who had been infected so long ago. Then, by chance, Dr. Richard Miller, a doctor and medical epidemiologist at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington, learned that blood had been saved from the strep throat study.
Some researchers thought doctors were encouraging mastectomies because they did not think old women cared about their breasts. But Dr. Abrams said that often the women themselves were refusing lumpectomies because of the problem of getting to a radiation therapy center or other medical problems that made radiation therapy difficult for them. Esther Rahfeldt, an 84-year-old widow who lives alone in La Porte, Ind., said she refused to consider radiation therapy when she discovered a lump in her breast last December. It was not just the inconvenience of radiation treatments, she said. She also worried about her pacemaker. She did not want to have it removed and reset after the radiation therapy. Her doctor told her that her only option then was a mastectomy. ''I told him that if it came to that and it would be my life, then to take the breast,'' she said. Cancer specialists said their elderly patients often refused lumpectomies. Dr. Muss said: ''I have had patients who said, 'Look, dear, I live out in the country and I would be a tremendous burden. I prefer to have the mastectomy.' ''
The report did not change the advice for people whose cholesterol levels are above 130 but who have no other risk factors. Statins are seldom prescribed in such cases. A risk calculator is available on the heart, lung and blood institute's Web site, http://hin.nhlbi.nih.gov/atpiii/calculator.asp?usertype=prof. Millions of Americans will be affected by the new advice, said Dr. Christie M. Ballantyne, director of the Center for Cardiovascular Protection at Baylor College of Medicine. He said that among the more than 28 million Americans at high risk, at least 8 million had L.D.L. levels of 100 to 129. The recommendations also call for more intensive drug treatment of both moderately high and high risk patients, telling doctors that the goal should be to reduce patients' L.D.L. levels by 30 percent to 40 percent, no matter what the initial levels were. ''There is some evidence that physicians were using so-called starter doses of statins, and then not upping the dose when that did not produce enough L.D.L. lowering,'' Dr. Cleeman said. ''We are saying, 'Don't just drop their L.D.L. a few percentage points. Drop it by 30 or 40 percent so they will get real benefit.'''
As for whether implants lead to serious diseases, like cancer or autoimmune diseases, the company cited extensive reviews of epidemiological data by other groups. Ms. Kuhne flashed a long list of reports in her presentation, including ones by the National Institutes of Health, and the Institute of Medicine and from other countries, including Britain, and the European Independent Review Committee, all failing to find evidence that the implants are linked to cancer, autoimmune diseases or diseases in children. The meeting also included the personal testimony of women who had had silicone implants. There was Pam Dowd, for example, who said she came from Boise, Idaho, at her own expense. ''I stand before you breastless,'' Ms. Dowd said. She had had silicone implants after breast cancer and a mastectomy 28 years ago. Soon, she said, she suffered nerve pain and burning sensations in her spine. She reported ''M.S.-like symptoms,'' referring to those associated with multiple sclerosis, ''that cause me to fall at the drop of a hat.'' She said that her chest ''constantly itches and burns'' and that ''my bones still scream with the pain,'' even though her implants were removed. She urged the panel to keep the devices off the market.
While Plan B and a similar drug, Preven, made by Gyn√©tics Medical Products N.V. of Belgium, were in theory available to women by prescription, medical experts say the drugs are underused, even in five states that passed laws to make them easier to obtain. Those states -- Washington, California, Alaska, New Mexico and Hawaii-- allow pharmacists to provide emergency contraceptives to women without a prescription. Dr. Carole Ben-Maimon, the president of Barr Laboratories, which is in the process of buying Plan B from Women's Capital Corporation, its current owner, said that even with publicity directed at consumers and health care professionals in California, only 14 percent of pharmacies and pharmacists in the state provide the drugs without a prescription. ''In a state as large as California, finding emergency contraception without a prescription is still an enormous challenge,'' Dr. Ben-Maimon said. Another obstacle for women, she said, is that they are required to talk to the pharmacists, who decide whether emergency contraception is indicated. ''In my pharmacy, there aren't any areas where I can hold a private conversation with my pharmacist,'' Dr. Ben-Maimon said.
Staving Off Frailty Dorothy Bower, 78, used to take walks around the grounds of her assisted living residence in Wilkinsburg, Pa., near Pittsburgh. But no more. In the past six months, Ms. Bower says she has lost her energy. ''I make it down the hall and to the dining room,'' she says. ''I have the feeling that if I worked at it I would get better, but it's hard to get the motivation to try harder.'' ''It is enough of an effort as far as I'm concerned to get to the door of our room,'' Mrs. Bower says. ''That takes me about five minutes.'' Mrs. Bower's problem is frailty, doctors say. It is increasingly common as people age, and its symptoms -- losing muscle mass and strength, feeling depleted, walking slowly, losing weight and doing less and less in a day -- go together, says Dr. Linda Fried, a geriatrician and epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins who defined and characterized the syndrome. ''They are all connected and form a vicious cycle,'' she says.
There was an 88-year-old who slumped forward at lunch, losing consciousness. When he came to, he had trouble forming words. There was a middle-age man whose stroke was unforgettable. When Dr. Warach saw his initial M.R.I. scan, in his basement office at his home, he cried out in astonishment so loudly his wife ran downstairs. ''I have never seen anything so severe,'' Dr. Warach said. None of the three arteries that supplied the man's right hemisphere were getting any blood. Now the man lay in a coma, twitching on his left side, paralyzed on his right, breathing with the help of a ventilator. If he survived, he would have severe brain damage. There was Michael Collins, a 49-year-old police officer who had had a stroke in his police car in Takoma Park, Md. Unlike the others, Mr. Collins seemed mostly recovered. The next few days, though, would determine whether he was among the lucky 10 percent of stroke patients who escape unscathed or whether he would always be weaker on his left side. If that happened, Mr. Collins said, he could never return to his job.
As for Dr. Lange, he said that the patients enrolled in his company's trials in Eastern and Central Europe might eventually have to give up their ranolazine. But he comforts himself, he said, by remembering that for now, they are still getting the drug as part of the company's safety studies. ''I haven't had to bite the bullet yet,'' he said.
''We talk of control, of preventing tumor growth,'' he said. '' We will not necessarily be able to eliminate this invader but we will be able, with drugs, to let you live with it for some undefined period of time.'' For now, Ms. Mayer said, the fundamental issue for cancer survivors is uncertainty. Is the disease gone or will it come back? What did those treatments do to you? ''It's, 'Do I have or did I have?''' she said. ''It's an existential choice and the truth is that I don't know. But people often make a choice: 'I will see myself as cancer-free.' Or, 'It's chronic. It could come back at any time. I am living with cancer.''' ''It's the not knowing that is really the critical issue,'' she said. ''It's living with uncertainty, learning to live with that.''

The flu pandemic arrived in the United States in October 1918 and was gone by January 1919, afflicting a third of the pregnant women in the United States. What happened to their children? Dr. Almond asked. He compared two populations: those whose mothers were pregnant during the flu epidemic and those whose mothers were pregnant shortly before or shortly after the epidemic. To his astonishment, Dr. Almond found that the children of women who were pregnant during the influenza epidemic had more illness, especially diabetes, for which the incidence was 20 percent higher by age 61. They also got less education -- they were 15 percent less likely to graduate from high school. The men's incomes were 5 percent to 7 percent lower, and the families were more likely to receive public assistance. The effects, Dr. Almond said, occurred in whites and nonwhites, in rich and poor, in men and women. He convinced himself, he said, that there was something to the Barker hypothesis.
Dr. Topol said a patient typically goes to a cardiologist with a vague complaint like indigestion or shortness of breath, or because a scan of the heart indicated calcium deposits -- a sign of atherosclerosis, or buildup of plaque. The cardiologist puts the patient in the cardiac catheterization room, examining the arteries with an angiogram. Since most people who are middle-aged and older have atherosclerosis, the angiogram will more often than not show a narrowing. Inevitably, the patient gets a stent. ''It's this train where you can't get off at any station along the way,'' Dr. Topol said. ''Once you get on the train, you're getting the stents. Once you get in the cath lab, it's pretty likely that something will get done.'' One reason for the enthusiastic opening of blocked arteries is that it feels like the right thing to do, Dr. Hillis said. ''I think it is ingrained in the American psyche that the worth of medical care is directly related to how aggressive it is,'' he said. ''Americans want a full-court press.''
The long, brutal process that leads to Alzheimer's disease starts when a single enzyme snips a protein that protrudes from brain cells, leading to the release of toxic shards. Now scientists report that they have found that enzyme, opening the door to developing drugs that might block it and, if the drugs prove safe, to preventing or slowing the disease. The discovery of the enzyme had eluded teams of scientists at universities and drug companies for more than a decade, though they had given it a name, beta-secretase. So many false claims of victory were announced that investigators automatically doubted anyone who claimed to have found it. But experts say that the new work, by Dr. Martin Citron and his colleagues at Amgen, a biotechnology company in Thousand Oaks, Calif., is different -- that it passes crucial tests of authenticity, convincing even some skeptics. The report appears today in the journal Science.
''It's one of the classic mistakes in the history of science,'' Dr. Brooks said. Its origins lie in a study by a Nobel laureate, Otto Meyerhof, who in the early years of the 20th century cut a frog in half and put its bottom half in a jar. The frog's muscles had no circulation -- no source of oxygen or energy. Dr. Myerhoff gave the frog's leg electric shocks to make the muscles contract, but after a few twitches, the muscles stopped moving. Then, when Dr. Myerhoff examined the muscles, he discovered that they were bathed in lactic acid. A theory was born. Lack of oxygen to muscles leads to lactic acid, leads to fatigue. Athletes were told that they should spend most of their effort exercising aerobically, using glucose as a fuel. If they tried to spend too much time exercising harder, in the anaerobic zone, they were told, they would pay a price, that lactic acid would accumulate in the muscles, forcing them to stop.
''No one knows the significance of a one-millimeter nodule,'' Dr. Kessler said. ''No one.'' He added that the tests are safe and effective in a literal sense: they are not harmful in themselves, and they are effective in finding abnormalities. But, he said, that does not necessarily mean that patients benefit from them. While the tests themselves are generally not covered by insurance, the health care system may well bear the cost of follow-up tests and operations for the abnormalities they detect. ''That's where science, the marketplace, and patients are caught in a bind,'' Dr. Kessler said. ''This is a pretty heavy-duty exam that seems to have sort of escaped into the marketplace. We have a technology that's gotten caught in the gaps between the scientific agencies, the regulatory agencies, and the payers who pay for health care of all sorts. The fair evaluation of these procedures is no one's province. That's the gap here.''
Some patients say they are just not interested in taking drugs. ''There are side effects to the statin drugs,'' said June Hament, 56, who lives in the New Jersey suburbs of Philadelphia. After years of trying ''every diet I could think of to lower cholesterol'' and taking herbs and supplements, Ms. Hament said, she has finally gotten her cholesterol down with a low-carbohydrate diet and a weight loss of about 15 pounds. Though she had lost weight before, her cholesterol had never budged, she said. While it is still above the guidelines, she is satisfied. ''Cholesterol seems to me possibly a symptom of something, not necessarily a cause,'' she said. Heart disease experts are troubled and frustrated. They know that the guidelines, if followed, will mean a windfall for drug companies, whose annual sales of statins, the most popular cholesterol drugs, are about $12.5 billion a year, according to IMS Health, which tracks drug sales. But, experts say, cholesterol lowering can prevent much of the misery of heart disease, and the drugs are highly effective for those who need them. So why do so many Americans have cholesterol levels that are so high?
But it was not clear how to identify those patients in advance. It turned out, though, that the bucindolol trial was unique in heart disease research. Genetic material is not obtained from patients in most studies, but the researchers who conducted the bucindolol trial insisted that the participants' DNA be collected and stored. Dr. Bristow and Dr. Liggett realized that they had a chance to test Dr. Liggett's hypothesis. They could go through the trial data and ask whether the gene variants identified responders and nonresponders to the drug. The gene tests succeeded, as the investigators report this week in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Responders not only did well with bucindolol, having a 38 percent reduction in their death rate, but they also did better than patients who were taking beta blockers that are already on the market. Now Dr. Bristow wants to resurrect bucindolol. He has licensed it, formed a company, Arca Discovery, and hired Dr. Liggett as a consultant. He is applying to the Food and Drug Administration to market the drug along with a genetic test.
''The guidance they were given was very cursory,'' she said of researchers. '' 'Inform the community.' All right. How do you do that? What defines community? Is it the patients who live near the hospital? Is it enough just to go to the I.R.B.,'' each medical center's institutional review board, which sets ethical guidelines for research? ''Is it enough to go to patient advocacy groups? Is it enough to go to churches, shopping centers, health clinics? One investigator from Detroit said: 'Good grief! A lot of my patients are gang members. How do I inform their community?' '' In the end, the researchers and their universities used a variety of methods, for instance visiting Rotary Clubs, shopping centers and churches, appearing on local television programs and providing information to newspapers. Of all the patients they wound up enrolling, 38 percent were enrolled without prior consent. And only one family asked that a patient who had been enrolled without its consent be removed from the study, Dr. Clifton said.
Dr. Thompson told the technicians to measure the woman's pressure again with a different device. This time, it read 120. ''This is just a major, major thing,'' he said. ''Soon we won't know what anyone's blood pressure is.''
When they learned of the Mayo Clinic findings in 1997, Dr. Burger and his colleagues said, they felt an obligation to test all of the patients in the weight-loss study for possible heart damage. Although they contacted all 591 patients, only 226 returned for echocardiograms. Among them, 18, or 8 percent, had leaky heart valves. Fifteen of the 18 had leaky aortic valves, and 3 had leaky mitral valves. Doctors found that the leaks had produced no symptoms and did not require medical precautions or treatment. Researchers in Boston then found that according to a study of more than 3,000 people, the Framingham Heart Study, heart valve abnormalities occurred in the general population at about the same rate as the patients in their weight-loss study. ''The bad valve disease suggested by the Mayo group has not been found,'' Dr. Burger said. ''Maybe there is less of an association between fen-phen and valve disease than we thought previously.''
Professor Kalick used data from a study that began in the 1930's in Berkeley and Oakland, Calif. Hundreds of residents agreed to be photographed and to have their health assessed on an annual basis from the ages of 11 to 18. They each had an additional health assessment when they were in their 30's and again between the ages of 58 and 66. In Professor Kalick's study, volunteers looked at photographs of the subjects' faces when they were 17, 17 1/2 and 18 and rated them on how attractive they were. Dr. Kalick and his colleagues knew from the study records how healthy these people were as teen-agers and how healthy they would be later. They could thus determine whether the healthiest people were rated as the most attractive. It turned out that they were not. Those with the fewest and least severe illnesses were no more attractive than those who always seemed to be sick. And those who had the fewest medical problems when they grew older were not better looking than those plagued with ill health.
More than 90 percent of the fresh salmon eaten in this country is farmed, and sales have been growing by 10 percent to 20 percent a year, said Alex Trent, executive director of Salmon of the Americas, an industry group. Officials of the Food and Drug Administration disputed the study's recommendations. ''We certainly don't think there's a public health concern here,'' said Dr. Terry Troxell, director of the agency's office of plant and dairy foods and beverages. ''Our advice to consumers is not to alter their consumption of farmed or wild salmon.'' The agency's tolerance level for PCB's in salmon is 2000 parts per billion, which is nearly 55 times the level found in the farmed fish. The Environmental Protection Agency has a lower level for fish caught in sport fishing, but defers to the F.D.A. when it comes to setting levels for commercial fish. Dr. Troxell said most contaminants were found in the skin of the fish and the fat just beneath it.
The estrogens in Prempro, Dr. Stefanick said, ''are as natural to the horse as the phytoestrogens are to the South American yam.'' As for soy, she asked, ''If it is natural to a soy plant, does that make it natural to humans?''
The message in the blame-obesity approach, said James Marone, a political science professor at Brown University, is that it is so important to persuade fat people to lose weight that common sense disappears. ''Anything we can say to persuade you, we will say,'' Dr. Marone added. So is it working? It doesn't seem to be. Fat people are more reviled than ever, researchers find, even as more people become fat. When smokers and heavy drinkers turned pariah, rates of smoking and drinking went down. Won't fat people, in time, follow suit? Research suggests that the stigma of being fat leads to more eating, not less. And if reducing the stigma suggests a solution, that's not working either. ''One hypothesis about getting rid of stigma is having more contact with the stigmatized group,'' Dr. Brownell says. But with obesity, the stigma seems to be growing along with the national girth. He cites a famous study in the 1960's in which children were shown drawings of children with and without disabilities, as well as a drawing of a fat child. Who, they were asked, would you want for your friend? The fat child was picked last.
Since 2002, the World Anti-Doping Agency has said athletes must submit their medical tests well in advance of Olympic competitions. No longer will a doctor's note be enough; an independent panel of medical experts will determine whether the athletes have asthma severe enough to warrant medication. Dr. Wilber wants to pretest Olympic athletes in Beijing, something he did for several athletes competing in the 2004 Olympics in Athens. One or two years before the Olympics, the athletes will be going to Beijing for other competitions, Dr. Wilber said, and those events would be a perfect time to test them. To show how important it is to find out about asthma ahead of time, Dr. Wilber described an athlete who was competing in track and field and had no idea he had asthma until he tried exercising at the Athens Olympics. ''He tested positive for exercise-induced asthma, and we gave him the meds right there,'' Dr. Wilber said. ''A few days later, he won a silver medal.''
Approval of the drug immediately brought out the sharp contrasts in the views on abortion of Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. Mr. Gore said he was pleased with the decision, and Mr. Bush said it was wrong. Dr. Jane E. Henney, the F.D.A. commissioner, said in an interview,  ''Politics had no role in this decision.'' It was based, Dr. Henney said, on persuasive data showing that the drug is safe and effective. The drug will be distributed under the name Mifeprex by Danco Laboratories of New York City, a company formed specifically to find someone to make the drug and then to market it. While Danco is marketing the drug, the company has refused to disclose the manufacturer. Advocates of abortion rights said they were elated by the health agency's action. ''Never have I seen anything like this,'' said Gloria Feldt, the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, which participated in clinical trials of the drug. ''Never has there been a drug approval that has been through such an arduous political process.''
That is not what many men want to hear, he said. ''Men almost never like to admit that they are under stress,'' Mr. Kiefert said. ''Our male ego says it is a sign of weakness. We have a tendency to keep it inside, we try to tough it out.'' Not him, he adds. He still has prostate cancer, and he has changed his life. ''I avoid stress,'' Mr. Kiefert says. ''I know what happens when I'm under stress.'' Preventing Cancer Previous articles in this series explored whether diet and exercise matter in prevention. Subsequent ones will look at the roles of the environment and genetics. The series remains online, and readers can discuss cancer and stress in a forum: nytimes.com/science Preventing Cancer
Stephen G. Sudovar, the president and chief executive of EluSys, a fledgling biotechnology company in Pine Brook, N.J., has what he thinks is an immensely promising anthrax drug, which might save patients' lives by inactivating deadly bacterial toxins. But in dealing with the federal government, Mr. Sudovar, like others in his field, says he that has butted up against regulatory obstacles and research bottlenecks that may significantly delay the development of drugs to fight anthrax and other bioterrorism agents, just when there is heightened interest in such treatments. Mr. Sudovar needs to test his drug in monkeys, and one of the few places in the United States that can do those tests is the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, in Fort Detrick, Md.. Mr. Sudovar said his monkey tests at Fort Detrick were supposed to begin in June 2002. But that was before the anthrax attacks. Now, all bets are off.
Some people thought they knew what to expect of the Food and Drug Administration under President Bush: It would be attuned to business and sensitive to religious conservatives. It would put off difficult decisions and issue fewer regulations. Its commissioner, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, is a Republican and the brother of Mr. Bush's press secretary. Traditional Republican supporters, like large drug companies, praise him, so it might seem predictable that he would take a strong stand as he is doing this week against importing prescription drugs from Canada, a practice that undercuts prices here. But the decision has also put him in conflict with several governors -- some of them Republican -- and legislators who want cheaper drugs from Canada. A number of other decisions by Dr. McClellan have kept the Food and Drug Administration in the spotlight as one of the more activist agencies in the Bush administration. Granted, critics say that some of the rulings -- like banning ephedra -- were years in the making, but other people note that unlike, say, the Environmental Protection Agency, the F.D.A. has not seemed in retrenchment on regulatory matters.
In the past Medicare just paid the bills or said no to treatments. Now, with a flood of promising but astronomically expensive treatments and little data on how they work in the real world, Medicare has decided to use its 41 million beneficiaries to get some answers. And it is using the threat of refusing to pay unless patients are in a study as a cudgel to get companies or foundations or professional groups to pay for the research. The goal, Dr. McClellan said, is better and more cost-effective medicine. ''Instead of having 10 to 20 percent success rates over a broad population, we want to get to 80 to 90 percent who will benefit, and with fewer side effects,'' he said. At issue are questions that will determine the future and price of health care: Do new cancer drugs costing $10,000 to $20,000 a dose help in many situations where they are now being prescribed? What are the long-term effects of weight-loss surgery, costing $30,000 to $40,000 per operation even when there are no complications? How well do implantable defibrillators for heart patients, each costing $35,000, work? Will PET scans to look for early Alzheimer's disease, costing $1,670 per scan, make any difference?
For example, frontline units are equipped with sonogram machines the size of cassette recorders, and devices the size of a PDA that can do a complete laboratory analysis on a drop of blood. Another piece of the plan is to train surgeons and support staff, and once again military doctors turned to urban trauma center. ''They have too many patients,'' Colonel Holcomb said. ''We need patients.'' In Miami, Dr. Tom Knuth, who directs the Army Trauma Training Center at Ryder Trauma Center, is training military general surgeons, plastic surgeons and other specialists and technicians and medics. ''They integrate with the civil staff to manage whatever patients come through the door -- bad motor vehicle crashes, gunshot wounds,'' Dr. Knuth said. ''And they get to work together as a team.'' With the war, the training regimen has been compressed from a month to 10 days. Dr. Carlton said the war in Afghanistan showed what is possible. Of 250 seriously injured patients, only one died. ''It was the lowest died-of-wounds rate in the history of war,'' he said.
Vitamin E supplements can increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes, and studies of vitamin C supplements consistently failed to show that it had any beneficial effects. ''The two vitamins that are the most not needed are the ones most often taken,'' Dr. Russell said. Excess vitamin C is excreted in the urine, but excesses of some other vitamins are stored in fat, where they can build up. Of particular concern, researchers say, is vitamin A. It is found in liver, and small amounts are added to milk. But for most people who are reaching worrisome levels, the main source is supplements, multivitamins, nutrition bars, health drinks and cereals. Several recent large studies indicate that people with high levels of vitamin A in their blood have a greater risk for osteoporosis. People can easily reach a potentially dangerous level, about five times the recommended dose, by taking vitamins and supplements, nutrition researchers say. Some popular multivitamins run 1,500 micrograms a pill, twice the recommended daily amount and a level that, in one recent study, doubled the risk of bone fractures. Some supplements provide as much as 4,500 micrograms a day, well above the level that the National Academy of Sciences calls an upper limit for safety.
Colon cancer experts debate the importance of lesions as small as six to nine millimeters, but with conventional colonoscopy, doctors often cut off every polyp they find, so size has not been an issue. It becomes one with virtual colonoscopy. ''Do you ignore the six- to nine-millimeter polyps or do you repeat the test?'' Dr. Rex asked. ''If you repeat it, when? In 5 years, in 10 years? I don't think the public will accept the idea that they can have a six- to nine-millimeter polyp sitting in their colon, ignored.'' The question of who gets referred for a traditional colonoscopy ''may say more about us than about the science,'' said Dr. Russell Harris, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina. ''In our zeal to be sure every single polyp is eradicated,'' he said, ''suddenly, you have increased the costs and increased the possibility of harming someone. In our attempt to reduce the downside of colon cancer screening, we may end up increasing the risks.''
Doctors have found about a half-dozen people around the world who are unable to make any leptin at all. One, a girl who lives in England, weighed 207 pounds by age 9; at 6, doctors performed liposuction on her legs because she could hardly walk, according to a recent paper in The New England Journal of Medicine. At mealtimes, she would eat everything on her plate as quickly as possible and demand more, hiding food to eat between meals. Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly, a professor of metabolic medicine at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, began giving the girl injections of leptin. ''It was incredibly dramatic,'' Dr. O'Rahilly said. ''This was a child who had never lost weight in her life.'' All of a sudden, she lost most of her appetite, eating slowly at meals and ceasing to hide food for forbidden gorging between meals. Her weight plummeted. Dr. O'Rahilly is now treating another child who makes no leptin, a 3-year-old girl who would eat 2,000 calories at a sitting. That changed when she received leptin.
If they are right, it may be possible to stop Alzheimer's, and reverse the memory loss, if treatments begin before brain cells die. The new idea is that the disease starts when small clumps of a protein, amyloid, start interrupting signals between nerve cells in the brain. The synapses, where one cell signals another in the brain's intricate circuitry, no longer function. Yet, at this early stage of the disease, researchers say, the nerve cells are still alive and well, and the disease might be halted if the clumps of amyloid could be removed or inactivated. But if the disease continues, brain cells start to die. Dead and dying cells accumulate in heaps in the brain, and the injured brain cannot be made whole. The work is still in a research stage, and the possible therapies are years away, if they pan out at all. But Alzheimer's investigators say they are invigorated because they have some tantalizing ideas of ways to stop the small clusters of amyloid from inflicting injury, giving them hope that they may be able to squelch the disease.
A computer science professor at Harvard says he has found a way to send coded messages that cannot be deciphered, even by an all-powerful adversary with unlimited computing power. And, he says, he can prove it. If he is right, and he does have some supporters, his code may be the first that is both practical and provably secure. While there are commercially available coding systems that seem very hard to break, no one can prove that they cannot be cracked, mathematicians say. In essence, the researcher, Dr. Michael Rabin and his Ph.D. student Yan Zong Bing, have discovered a way to make a code based on a key that vanishes even as it is used. While they are not the first to have thought of such an idea, Dr. Rabin says that never before has anyone been able to make it both workable and to prove mathematically that the code cannot be broken.
The heart surgery data were clear, he said. The patients who did best were those whose surgeons were most experienced. Some busy doctors at community hospitals had better results than less-busy doctors at major medical centers. ''High-volume surgeons at lower-volume hospitals did just as well as high-volume surgeons at high-volume centers,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. ''And even if you were already at a high-volume hospital, it mattered if you chose a high-volume surgeon,'' he added. ''I think it's partly to do with the complexity of the procedure. How well you will do in the short and long term after a cardiovascular operation is often a function of how well your operation gets done.'' ''But what we found with many or most of the cancer operations was very different,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. A patient's chance of dying during or just after surgery was more related to the number of operations the hospital did and less to the number of operations the surgeon did. And, he reports in a paper that will soon be published in Annals of Surgery, cancer patients who go to hospitals that have more patients with their type of cancer also have better long-term survival.
''If authors can restrict the ways that readers can use knowledge,'' Dr. Lander added, ''the pace of discovery will be slowed and the public will lose,'' Others objected that the Celera agreement could be setting a dangerous precedent for the Balkanization of databases. They said they should be able to go to one place -- GenBank -- to compare genetic data. ''Some say that if Celera wants to publish, they should make their data available on that basis,'' Dr. David Baltimore, a molecular biologist and president of the California Institute of Technology, said. ''They say that if the need for commercialization is so important, then don't publish. Don't get the accolades of publication.'' Correction:  December 9, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about Celera Genomics' plan to make its genome data freely available to researchers while charging companies for access omitted part of a quotation by Dr. David Baltimore, a molecular biologist, in some editions. While he characterized some critics of the plan as saying ''that if the need for commercialization is so important, then don't publish,'' he also added: ''It's a reasonable point of view. But I think it's a point of view that's shortsighted. It does not provide the scientific community with access to the Celera data. It is basically cutting off your nose to spite your face.''
Edward Wright, a vice president at Welch Allyn Inc., which makes all three types of blood pressure devices -- mercury, aneroid and electronic -- says all are effective. ''These are highly accurate instruments when they are shipped,'' Mr. Wright said. But the mercury device has long been the gold standard. If properly maintained, it can give accurate readings for decades. Dr. Jones, speaking for the heart association, said it was still the preferred device. But now, he added, ''for the first time in 100 years we are faced with some places' not having mercury manometers available for blood pressure measurements.'' Dr. Edward Roccella, the coordinator of the institute's National High Blood Pressure Education Program, said there was no requirement that the devices be proved accurate under constant use. Nor must they be proved reliable for patients of a variety of ages, illnesses and sizes. Without vigilant monitoring, there is no way to know when they go awry.
Among the findings: With strokes, rapid treatment is crucial. During a stroke, an estimated 1.9 million nerve cells and 7.5 miles of nerve fiber die each minute. One drug is approved to treat strokes, tPA. But only 3 percent to 5 percent of patients receiveit. Less than a third of patients get to the hospital early enough, within three hours of the onset of symptoms. And even if they do, many hospitals do not offer the drug for reasons that have to do with money and the availability of stroke specialists. Half of all strokes could be prevented if patients controlled their blood pressure, and others could be prevented by controlling other risk factors, like smoking. But most patients were unaware of their risk or did not appreciate the importance of stroke prevention. Six Killers | Stroke Correction:  April 26, 2008, Saturday  An article on May 28, 2007, about preventing and treating strokes misstated the benefits of a drug, tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA. The drug protects stroke patients from disabilities, but it does not save lives. A reader discovered the error while doing research and pointed it out in an e-mail message this week.
Leading fertility specialists said they were taken aback by the new letter and could hardly believe its message. ''Sex selection is sex discrimination, and I don't think that is ethical,'' said Dr. James Grifo, the president-elect of the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, an affiliate of the reproductive medicine society. ''It's not ethical to take someone off the street and help them have a boy or a girl.'' Dr. Grifo, a reproductive endocrinologist at New York University Medical Center, added that publicity over centers offering such sex selection would sully the field and could ultimately make it impossible to help patients with a medical need for the technology. ''What's the next step?'' asked Dr. William Schoolcraft of the Colorado Center for Reproductive Medicine in Englewood. ''As we learn more about genetics, do we reject kids who do not have superior intelligence or who don't have the right color hair or eyes?''
But researchers note that it takes just a tiny energy imbalance -- a few more calories eaten than are burned -- for pounds to creep on. It is a difference so small that it could easily be below what surveys can detect. ''To gain 15 pounds in a year, you only have to have an imbalance of 150 calories a day, which is one soft drink,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''Even a Life Saver is 10 calories. An extra Life Saver a day is a pound a year.'' Some experts, like Dr. Steven Gortmaker, who directs the Harvard Prevention Research Center at the Harvard School of Public Health, have a culprit and an accomplice: television and the food industry. Not only are children sitting still while watching television but they are barraged with advertisements for food. ''You have this huge industry that's spending billions of dollars getting kids to eat more,'' Dr. Gortmaker said.
Others were more adamant. ''We are going to be absolutely sure that people know which doctors are doing this,'' said the Rev. Frank Pavone, the director of Priests for Life, a Roman Catholic group with its headquarters in Staten Island. ''We'll find out in the same way that any individual will find out -- we'll ask and we'll have people ask,'' Father Pavone said. And, for those doctors who fear  protests from his group, ''you're right,'' he said. ''We will protest and it will be very visible, very vocal, and absolutely unrelenting.'' In addition, he said, the group will be looking for malpractice cases to pursue if a woman takes mifepristone and remains pregnant -- which occurs in about 1 percent of cases -- and decides not to have a surgical abortion, and gives birth to a baby with birth defects. But Dr. Armstrong said he understood why doctors who do not now do abortions might be put off.
Dr. Charlesworth, 58, is one who tried but abandoned off-pump surgery. He said he was perfectly comfortable with his decision, adding: ''I'm at zero percent off-pump. I tried it for 40 patients. But when the results came in, I had trouble with the quality.'' The operations, he said, did not seem to be supplying patients' hearts with as much blood as he had expected, and the patients did not have other benefits that he had anticipated like shorter hospital stays. Dr. Felix Hernandez Jr. of the Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor said he had the ability to learn off-pump surgery and took the time to do so. Soon, he said, he was using it for 90 percent of his bypasses. Then he began to have second thoughts. Small studies were inconclusive on the whole, he said. But a study from Johns Hopkins raised questions about whether the problem should be called pumphead or atherosclerosis-head.
In that hypothesis, proposed by Dr. Mark. J. Gibbs at the Australian National University in Canberra and his colleagues, the virus emerged when a human flu virus acquired a piece of a gene from a pig flu virus. But flu experts said the idea, while intriguing, required much more data to be convincing. ''It is a stretch,'' said Dr. Webster, of St. Jude. Dr. Taubenberger agreed. He is analyzing the 1918 virus by working with three samples. Two are from preserved lung tissue from American soldiers who died of the epidemic in military camps, and the third is from the lungs of an Alaskan woman who also died of it and whose lungs remained frozen and preserved because she was buried in permafrost. So far, Dr. Taubenberger and his colleagues have sequenced half the viral genes. But, he said, they have found nothing yet that would have made the 1918 virus so lethal.
The results, some nutrition experts said, were disconcerting because vitamin E is widely used by people who hope it will act as an antioxidant and prevent heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and even the common cold. In fact, said Dr. William Thies, the vice president for medical and scientific affairs at the Alzheimer's Association, taking vitamin E has become ''part of the standard of care'' for Alzheimer's patients, even in the absence of solid evidence that it helps. The Council for Responsible Nutrition, an industry group, says the exact number of people who take vitamin E is not known, but the vitamin is among the most popular of all nutritional supplements. In 2003, sales of the vitamin totaled $710 million and it accounted for 11 percent of all vitamin sales, behind multivitamins , B vitamins and vitamin C. Dr. Miller said he began the study when he was asked to write a chapter on antioxidants and heart disease for a textbook on preventive cardiology. When he looked at data from clinical trials, however, he noticed that many seemed to show that vitamin users had more heart disease, not less.
The Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday that it had approved the marketing of an abortion-inducing pill, the first alternative to surgical abortion approved in the United States. The pill, a prescription drug, will be available to doctors in about four weeks, its distributor said. The drug, mifepristone, or RU-486,  will allow doctors like family practitioners and obstetricians to offer abortions outside of specialty clinics, and it will allow women to have abortions in the privacy of their homes up to seven weeks after their last menstrual period. Although most women who seek abortions do not do so until later in their pregnancies, the drug has taken on immense symbolic importance for both supporters and opponents of abortion rights. Many supporters of abortion rights have said its approval will transform the struggle over legal abortion, making the procedure more accessible and more private, and stall efforts by opponents of abortion to identify women who are having the procedure and doctors who are providing it.
People tried to find reasons. Maybe, many said, the problem is that Americans are under too much stress. But, as often happens when it comes to statistics, what this all means may depend on who is doing the interpreting. It's hard to make cross-cultural comparisons -- the populations may not be representative. But it can be even worse when the question involves health. Sometimes, the data that are needed just can't be found because what one country measures, another guesses. Take obesity, for example. Dr. Jeffrey M. Friedman, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University, once wondered how much thinner Europeans actually were. So he looked for nationally representative data that included actual measures of weight, not just what some groups of people said they weighed. The United States has such data, but not Europe, with the exception of England. ''You can't get those data,'' Dr. Friedman said. ''They don't exist.''
With different doctors using such different reasoning, doctors and patients say they can be frustrated and confused about what to do. Dr. Christopher Cannon of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston needed advice for his mother. Her H.D.L. was above 100, which is very high, but her L.D.L. was 160, also high. Last year, he called Dr. Rader, who said that because Dr. Cannon's mother's only risk factor for heart disease was her L.D.L., he did not advise treatment. But now, new studies, including one reported last week by Dr. Cannon and his colleagues, are indicating that people might do much better with much lower levels of L.D.L. He looked over his own data and said it showed people with high H.D.L. levels got the same benefit from driving their L.D.L. very low as people whose H.D.L. was low or normal. So, he says, he will be calling Dr. Rader again. ''It's time for a reassessment,'' he said.
''Often people in this age group do not want aggressive treatment,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Abrams, who coordinates breast cancer trials at the National Cancer Institute. One of the first attempts to address the needs of elderly cancer patients was a study, sponsored by the cancer institute, that was designed to help patients like Dr. Ansari's: if a patient is 70 or older when breast cancer is discovered, can she get away with just a lumpectomy and hormonal therapy with the antiestrogen drug tamoxifen? Are those six weeks of radiation really necessary? Another study, in which Dr. Chabner is participating, involves lung cancer patients who are 70 and older, testing a mild chemotherapy regimen with the drug taxol. ''It's relatively easy to take and nontoxic,'' Dr. Chabner said. But the breast cancer trial showed the way, cancer experts said. Dr. Abrams said that an impetus for the trial was the cancer institute's own data. Elderly women just were not having lumpectomies.
They were a small group of eminent academic scientists who had reputations to think of. They were repelled by what they saw as the hucksterism and charlatanism that had given attempts to delay human aging a bad name. And yet, at a recent meeting here, most agreed that science might be on the brink of being able to stretch the human life span, perhaps significantly. Scientists have had astonishing success in recent years in increasing the life spans of laboratory species like worms and fruit flies. The time was ripe to review these  discoveries and discuss what might lie ahead, said Dr. Gregory Stock, a professor at the University of California School of Medicine at Los Angeles, who brought together 10 experts on for a two-day conference. ''Given adequate funding, given lucky breaks, how far could we go?'' Dr. Stock asked. Future generations, they said, may be able to avail themselves of scientifically established techniques to stretch the human life span like a piece of taffy until it reaches 150, even 200 years.
Other studies, with flies, mice and rats, looked at survival curves, the chance that an individual will survive from birth to a particular age. ''You can see if an intervention is affecting survival over a period of time but not whether it is affecting mortality that day,'' Dr. Vaupel said. ''You can't see whether there is a memory of all the bad things you've done in the past.'' But, researchers said, previous studies are at least consistent with the new discovery. Rats and mice, for example, live about 30 percent longer when their diets are restricted and the dietary restriction can start in infancy or in middle age. They also found that if rodents are kept on restricted diets until middle age and then switched to eating what they want, they lose the life-prolonging effect of dieting. It would take a study with as many as 500 rodents to see if dietary restriction has the same immediate effect in mammals as it did in fruit flies, Dr. Partridge said. But, at least in flies, she can now start asking what is happening to give the insects a suit of armor against whatever it is that might have killed them. Or, she said, ''the more interesting question is, What is killing them when they eat too much?''
Other scientists said the new work was immensely important, leading the way to identifying dangerous viruses before it is too late and to find ways to disable them. The 1918 flu, which killed as many as 50 million people worldwide, showed how terrible that disease can be. It had been ''like a dark angel hovering over us,'' said Dr. Oxford, the virology professor at St. Bartholomew's. The virus spread and killed with terrifying speed, preferentially striking the young and the healthy. Alfred W. Crosby, author of ''American's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918,'' said that it ''killed more humans than any other disease in a similar duration in the history of the world.'' The research, and its publication, raised concerns about whether scientists should actually resurrect this killer that vanished from the earth nearly a century ago. ''It is something we take seriously,'' said Dr. Fauci, whose institute helped pay for the work. The work was extensively reviewed, he added, and the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity was asked to decide whether the results should be made public. The board ''voted unanimously that the benefits outweighed the risk that it would be used in a nefarious manner,'' Dr. Fauci said.
Over the past few months, Internet companies said, demand for the drug has surged. GlobalRx, which has just four full-time employees, says it had 150 memantine clients a few months ago. Now, with about 600, it says it cannot handle any more orders. A British company, International Antiaging Systems, which will ship the drug even without a doctor's order, says that until recently it was supplying 50 patients a month. Now it is supplying about 500, most of whom are in the United States. The families pay for memantine out of pocket, typically $150 to $175 a month, plus about $60 for express delivery. The phenomenon has taken Alzheimer experts by surprise. Family members of Alzheimer patients are often elderly, deferential to doctors, cautious and respectful of the Food and Drug Administration. But they say they have little choice -- they feel that memantine offers hope, however small, in improving symptoms of patients in the later stages of the disease, possibly helping those who are on the cusp of going to a nursing home, losing their ability to walk or talk, to bathe or even to watch television.
In any case, both doses of aspirin reduced the risk of more ominous-appearing large polyps. Such polyps occurred in 12.9 percent of patients taking a placebo, in 10.7 percent of those taking a regular aspirin and in 7.7 percent of those taking a baby aspirin. Dr. Hawk said he was encouraged that aspirin had not led to bleeding problems in the two studies. ''Aspirin was very well tolerated,'' he said. ''It was not significantly different from the placebo.'' Another colon cancer expert, Raymond N. DuBois, who directs the cancer prevention program at the Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center in Nashville, added that while the patients in the studies did not take drugs to protect themselves from gastrointestinal bleeding, there was an effective method of such protection: people can take an over-the-counter antacid, like Pepcid, that contains a histamine blocker. Colon cancer specialists say that while almost all colon and rectal cancers start as polyps, most polyps will never become cancers.
There are also health benefits, said Dr. Claude Bouchard, the director of the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. If men or women work sufficiently hard at weight training, the muscle they build is more efficient, with more mitochondria, which are the cell's energy factories. The muscle is also better at using fat for fuel and better at allowing people to use insulin to clear sugar from the blood, which reduces their susceptibility to diabetes. Studies also show that weight lifting can help with problems of aging. Investigators at the National Institute of Aging found that older people with osteoarthritis of the knee had less pain and improved mobility when they strengthened their leg muscles, working on those that support the knee. And, researchers say, weight lifting can stave off the sort of muscle wasting that forces older people to grab a chair handle for support when they rise.
The patient, a man in his 60's, arrived at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation hospital in acute discomfort. His defibrillator, a tiny device implanted in his chest to correct abnormal heart rhythms, was going off six times a day or more, with a jolt that felt like a boxer's punch to the chest. The defibrillator was working properly; the man's heart disease was so advanced that his heart rhythms kept going awry. As the man lay in his hospital bed about two years ago, ''it was getting to the point where it was happening once an hour,'' his cardiologist, Dr. Michael Lauer, recalled. The doctors tried to calm the man's heart, to no avail. ''We were all gathered around his bed, five or six doctors, and we didn't know what to do,'' Dr. Lauer said. It was Dr. Lauer's first experience with a condition that he and other medical experts say they are seeing more often. It was unforgettable.
''It is the rare adolescent that ever comes to see me before she has sex the first time,'' said Dr. Abby B. Berenson, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. ''Usually that's because she hadn't planned to have it in the first place. It just happens, usually on a Saturday night when I'm not available.'' Correction:  December 18, 2003, Thursday  An article yesterday about the morning-after pill under consideration by the Food and Drug Administration for over-the-counter sales misstated its effectiveness. According to its distributor, the Women's Capital Corporation, the pill, known as Plan B, can reduce the chance of pregnancy by 89 percent if used within 72 hours of unprotected sex -- not prevent up to 89 percent of unplanned pregnancies. A heading in the News Summary characterized the pill incorrectly. The F.D.A. classifies it as a contraceptive, not an abortion pill, because it is designed to prevent pregnancy up to 72 hours after unprotected sex. It acts in most cases by preventing ovulation, but may also prevent fertilization or the implantation of a fertilized egg in the uterus.
New findings that aspirin may prevent colon cancer have bolstered a growing area of research into whether humble aspirin or drugs like it will work against a range of malignancies. It will be years before the question is answered. Until then, experts say, people should be wary of taking the drugs on speculation, because they all can have side effects. But the intriguing new colon cancer findings -- and a wide array of test tube, animal and epidemiological data -- are encouraging scientists working in the field. More than a dozen studies are under way, involving patients at high risk of cancer of the lung, breast, skin, prostate, colon, mouth, bladder or esophagus. The patients are randomly assigned to take the drugs or dummy pills, and doctors will see how many in each group develop cancer. Similar studies are being conducted to determine whether the drugs can enhance standard treatment regimens for patients who already have cancer.
And cancer cells are clearly foreign tissue. Their surfaces are studded with proteins that look very different from the proteins on normal cells. The T cells of the immune system, which should start the attack, are perfectly capable of recognizing the foreignness of the cancer cells. But for some reason, they do not. Why not? The answer, Dr. Pardoll, Dr. Allison and others have found, is that proteins on the surface of cancer cells turn off the immune system's attack. At the same time, the tumor is excreting molecules that recruit immune system cells to help it metastasize, spreading through tissues and organs. ''We knew very little about what regulated these immune responses to tumors until very recently,'' Dr. Pardoll said. ''We now are in a position to totally rewrite the book.'' One immediate consequence of this line of thinking is a new idea for treatment: scientists could seal off the cancer cells' proteins that block the immune system and enable white blood cells to kill the tumor. Or they could make the immune system more aggressive. To do that, they can block a molecule on the surface of T cells, CTLA-4, that tends to dampen the immune response.
I have an image of perfect health. It's a photograph of a young woman smiling, her teeth white, her hair shining, her skin glowing, her body thin and muscular -- the sort of picture that appears on the cover of magazines like American Health. It's the true me, of course, the me if I did everything right and took an anti-aging pill. Of course, it's ridiculous. Yet somehow, that loosely defined word ''health'' and that loaded word ''beauty'' are so intricately entwined that many of us confuse them, consciously or subconsciously, in our incessant dream of perfect health -- or is it perfect beauty? The icons of health and beauty assault me relentlessly. I can't forget my favorite advertisement for breakfast cereal, which showed a bicyclist in the golden light of dawn, or the advertisements for bottled water that featured slim and sweaty athletes downing a drink. Then there are the clothing catalogues that show up, unbidden, in my mailbox, with young models cavorting in sparkling blue surf. The health-and-beauty industry suffuses our society and our economy, luring us to buy food, clothing, cosmetics, exercise equipment, even cars -- the Chevrolet Web site features a young father mounting bikes on top of his minivan; my local BMW dealer displays a folding BMW bicycle as prominently as its autos.
Yet cloning also has its successes, starting with Dolly, clones that were born healthy and live long and apparently normal lives. There is also no secret to how to clone. ''There are hundreds of publications describing how to do it,'' said Dr. Mark Westhusin, a cloning expert at Texas A&amp;M University who has cloned cattle, goats and a cat. ''The basic techniques and protocols are out there.'' Human cloning also would require embryologists and physicians with expertise in the delicate tasks of manipulating eggs and even poking them with needles. Those experts are everywhere, scientists said, working at fertility clinics. ''There are lots of people who have these skills,'' Dr. Westhusin said. Dr. Rawlins said that while he was skeptical of the Clonaid assertions, he also thought that humans would eventually be cloned. ''It's a matter of technique and time,'' he said. ''The genie is out of the bottle.''
The questions will be discussed today at a meeting on hormone replacement therapy at the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Vivian Pinn, who directs the office of research on women's health at the institutes, said she asked each institute to tell what it decided to do about its hormones studies, and why. The decisions on whether to continue hormone studies were made by independent committees that oversee studies. The questions about hormone replacement arose last spring, when an independent group of experts that periodically examined accumulating data from the Women's Health Initiative, a federal study, decided that it had to stop. Its 16,000 participants, all healthy women, were randomly assigned to take Prempro, a popular combination of estrogen and progestin, or a placebo for comparison. The hope was that the drugs would generally improve women's health. But at a meeting on May 31, about three years before the study was scheduled to end, the committee saw data indicating that the women taking Prempro had slightly more heart attacks and strokes, more blood clots and more breast cancer. Those risks were not outweighed by the benefits -- slightly fewer fractures and a slightly lower risk of colon cancer.
Dr. Charles Stevens, a neurologist at the Salk Institute in San Diego, and a consultant to Motorola, said there had been many dozens of studies that failed to show health effects of microwave radiation like that emitted by cell phones, and he knew of no studies that had been replicated that showed effects.
He added that the legal, safe way to do it is through glycerin loading. The technique exploits the unusual properties of glycerin, a thick, gooey sugar alcohol that is sold in drugstores as a lubricant. Each molecule of glycerin absorbs three molecules of water. During a race, the body uses the glycerin for energy. And every time the body metabolizes a molecule of glycerin, ''it unleashes three molecules of water,'' Dr. Martin said. The result, he said, is that ''you have a water bank account.'' Glycerin loading, he added, should be reserved for races of a half marathon or longer, when runners are competing in intense heat for at least an hour and a half. Ten days before the Tokyo world championships, Dr. Martin told Steve Spence to try glycerin loading. ''He told me it would help with hydration,'' Mr. Spence said. ''I asked a lot of questions. I was very skeptical because I didn't want to mess with anything. But they assured me it wouldn't cause any problems.''
But researchers say the good news about breast cancer rates is a vindication of the Women's Health Initiative, a large study that was attacked from the start as being too big, too expensive, unnecessary because everyone knew hormone therapy promoted health, and even unethical, because some women would have to take placebos for comparison. Now, investigators say, the news that breast cancer rates are going down for the first time makes sense because hormones are among the only known factors that can affect cancer so immediately. Something similar happened a few decades ago when researchers realized that the popular hormone therapy of the time, estrogen alone without progestins, was causing cancer of the endometrium, the lining of the uterus. When the link became known, women who had not had hysterectomies to remove their uterus began taking estrogen with progestins, which lowered the cancer risk. Dr. Barnett Kramer, associate director of the office of disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health, said there was a sharp drop in prescriptions for estrogen alone, followed ''by a very rapid decline'' in endometrial cancer.
As for LDL cholesterol, the dangerous form, Dr. Libby said, ''If we applied lifestyles and the drugs we have consistently and according to guidelines, LDL is a done deal.'' Dr. Levy thinks he understands why these prevention strategies are given such short shrift. Prevention, he says, ''does not have a face.'' There are no personal stories, no individuals who can be pointed to as the success of prevention. It is just statistics. SIX KILLERS: HOW IT HAPPENS
The reason for the resistance, Dr. Faustman and some colleagues believe, was simple: her findings, which raise the possibility that an inexpensive, readily available drug might effectively treat Type 1 or juvenile diabetes, challenge widespread assumptions. Many diabetes researchers insist that a cure lies instead in research on stem cells and islet cell transplants. Dr. Faustman's story, scientists say, illustrates the difficulties that creative scientists can have when their work questions conventional wisdom and runs into entrenched interests. But if she is correct, scientists will also have to reconsider many claims for embryonic stem cells as a cure for diabetes, and perhaps for other diseases. ''I wish Denise well, and I flat out hope she's right,'' said Dr. Mark Atkinson, a diabetes expert who directs the Center for Immunology and Transplantation at the University of Florida College of Medicine. ''But the environment she's trying to move this forward in is so much like kids in a sandbox, whipping sand around. It's hard to see with so much sand in the air.''
Dr. Colton, the internist here, is frustrated, too. ''The system is broken,'' he said. ''I'm not being a mean ogre, but when you give something away for free, there is nothing to keep utilization down. And as the doctor, you have nothing to gain by denying them what they want.'' Re-examining Medicare Since its inception in 1965, Medicare has improved the health of the elderly while playing an outsize role in shaping the delivery of health care for all Americans. This article is the fourth in a series examining efforts to overhaul Medicare and ways that rules of the program influence the economics and practice of medicine. The articles will remain online at nytimes.com/business. Re-examining Medicare
With the new scans, most patients with chest pains or other symptoms will no longer need angiograms to see if a coronary artery is narrowed or blocked by atherosclerosis. That procedure typically takes 45 minutes and requires sedating the patient, threading a catheter from the groin to the heart, injecting a dye and taking X-ray pictures that show outlines of the arteries. It is about four times as expensive as the new CT scans are expected to cost. Excited by the scans' potential, companies including General Electric, Siemens, Philips and Toshiba are competing to make the machines. They say they could save the health care system money by replacing diagnostic angiograms and be lucrative for doctors and hospitals -- as well as for the manufacturers. Hundreds of medical centers have scanners that can show the heart and its arteries, but companies are only now installing their most recently developed machines, ones with as many as 64 detectors, as compared with old machines that had at most four detectors and could not provide clear images of a beating heart.
''People were shocked,'' Dr. Heymsfield said. ''It set off a worldwide excitement.'' But, scientists said, leptin proved disappointing in Amgen's preliminary studies. They found that most fat people made plenty of leptin and when they took the drug it appeared to have little effect on appetite or weight loss. Amgen's spokesman, David Kaye, said that the company's scientists think the problem might be that their drug did not last long enough in the body. Mr. Kaye said Amgen was testing a longer lasting formulation. But some researchers say leptin may act differently from what was originally thought. These scientists say that the important signal in the brain may be a decline in leptin levels. If someone loses weight by dieting, he will have less fat and should make less leptin. The brain, sensing that something is wrong, will signal the body to eat and put on more fat, bringing leptin levels up again. If there is no leptin at all because the leptin gene does not function, or if the brain does not recognize leptin, the brain thinks the body has starved itself to emaciation and signals it to eat ceaselessly.
SHE charges that his group is like the Taliban. He claims that her group's dangerous message has ''spread like a virus across North America, Europe and elsewhere.'' The issue inspiring such invectives? Not religion, but diets. The latest spat is between Veronica Atkins, widow of Robert Atkins, the doctor who promoted a low-carbohydrate diet, heavy on the meats, and the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a group that advocates vegetarianism. After Dr. Atkins died last April, the vegetarian group obtained his medical records and gave them to The Wall Street Journal, which reported this month that he weighed 258 pounds and had signs of congestive heart failure. (Mrs. Atkins has said her husband's high weight was the result of fluid buildup from the accidental fall that killed him.) The vegetarians had already formed their conclusions. ''Many health authorities have been shocked and greatly troubled by the spread of the Atkins phenomenon,'' the group proclaimed on its Web site.
''The economics are horrific,'' said Dr. Steven DeKosky, director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Diane E. Meier, a professor of geriatrics and ethics at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan, agreed. ''We are spending a huge amount of money keeping people with irreversible brain failure alive,'' she said. ''If the technology exists, we feel we must use it. Our colleagues in Europe consider what we do bizarre to the point of disbelief.'' But others contend that to withhold treatment is to hasten death, in effect, playing God. ''There are people in my field who have legitimate concerns that we might be too eager to pull the plug,'' said Dr. Christine Cassel, an expert in geriatrics, ethics and end-of-life care, and president and chief executive of the American Board of Internal Medicine. ''Just because someone has Alzheimer's disease doesn't mean their life has no value.''
While cautioning that the danger to an individual woman is tiny, the study investigators say that over all the drugs' risks exceed their benefits. The study did not address the question of estrogen alone. Women who have had hysterectomies take estrogen by itself -- progestin is added only to prevent estrogen from causing cancer of the uterine lining, and doctors do not prescribe estrogen alone for women with uteruses. The risks and benefits of estrogen alone are under study in a second clinical trial, of 11,000 women, being conducted by the Women's Health Initiative. That study is continuing because there is no evidence so far that the drug's risks exceed its benefits. For now, Dr. Rossouw said, with just estrogen, ''the risks and benefits remain unclear,'' but ''we can say there is no indication of an increased risk of breast cancer.'' The findings on the hormone combination will be published in the July 17 issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. The journal planned to release them this morning so the data would be available to doctors and women at the same time as the women in the study received their letters telling them to stop taking the drugs. But Cox News Service published the story last night.
''I started out by saying, when will I die or when will I know I am cured?'' Dr. Mullan said. ''Those were the two endpoints.'' But, he said, he soon learned the reality. ''Neither occurs for a while,'' he said, ''and for some of us a long while.''
But there may be more to it than ignorance. There also is the image those pills convey of a sick person. Mr. Orr said he did not like to think of himself as someone who had to take a fistful of pills every day. Even the recommended daily aspirin seemed superfluous, he thought. ''I think I sort of pooh-poohed the notion that one tablet of aspirin each day would do anything,'' Mr. Orr said. What it does is make blood less likely to clot. In Mr. Orr's case, Dr. Antman said, it is likely that when Mr. Orr was exercising on the cross-trainer, an area of plaque ruptured. Then a clot began to form in the area, eventually blocking the artery. The problem was not exercise, which is good for people with heart disease, but Mr. Orr's decision not to take his medications, Dr. Antman said. If he had been taking aspirin that clot would have had more difficulty forming and growing.
Another is to use the body's own immune system, stimulating the production of antibodies that will attach themselves to the small amyloid clusters and sweep them away. ''You trigger the immune system into doing a cleanup job,'' Dr. Mucke said. That is a strategy that works well in mice, but initial studies in humans were halted because some of the patients developed brain inflammations. ''This was not entirely unexpected,'' Dr. Mucke remarked. ''Harnessing the immune system is a tricky business and we have to learn how to fine-tune it.'' It also may be possible to enhance the body's own ways of removing the small clusters of amyloid. There are enzymes, like one known as neprilysin, that appear to chew up amyloid, Dr. Mucke said. ''People make them normally,'' he added, explaining that if their levels were increased, it might tip the balance in people developing Alzheimer's, preventing them from accumulating enough of the protein to damage their synapses.
Until now, Dr. Kiessling's patients used in vitro fertilization, working with their own doctors. Twelve babies have been born to nine couples, she said, and four women are pregnant now. Now she is advocating a new method: the woman holds the virus-free semen against her cervix with a cervical cap. An Illinois center has been struggling to find a way to help infected couples and is asking if the state law prohibiting fertility services for them may be superseded by the Americans With Disabilities Act. But some laboratory directors say they and their staffs are uncomfortable with the prospect of helping a couple with H.I.V., given the possibility that one or both parents will die prematurely. ''It was very emotional,'' one laboratory director said. In the end, a number of staff members said they would invoke the same right-of-conscience provision that allowed medical staff members to refuse to assist in abortions.
In a sharp change from current policy, an influential medical advisory group is recommending that all men ages 65 to 75 who have ever smoked have an ultrasound screening test to see if they are developing a condition that could kill them in minutes by bursting a major artery in the abdomen. The group, the United States Preventive Services Task Force, is an independent panel of medical experts that advises the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Its recommendations help set government policy and are generally followed by primary care doctors. The task force last looked at the condition, abdominal aortic aneurysms, in 1996 and concluded that there was insufficient evidence that a screening test would save lives. But now, it said, four large clinical trials have provided the evidence it needs, at least for those most at risk. Finding aneurysms early, with a scan that can cost $350 to $400, and repairing them with an operation that can cost $15,000 to $20,000 if there are no complications can cut the death rate by a third. Although the surgery can itself cause death, the risk that a large aneurysm will suddenly rupture and kill the patient is greater, the group said.
But, abortion providers say, unlike other areas of medicine, where prices have surged over the years, competition among abortion clinics has kept prices so low that an abortion in many cities costs less now than it did 25 years ago, without even adjusting for the nearly 500 percent inflation in medical services. If abortion had kept up with inflation in medical services, a $300 abortion in 1972 would cost $2,251 today. ''The fees are not set by the cost of the services but by the cost of the competition,'' said Dr. Warren Hern, owner of the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado. And, he said, ''the competition for patients is absolutely ruthless.'' While abortion providers report that many metropolitan areas -- New York, Northern New Jersey, large cities in California and Florida -- have a surplus of abortion providers, few places have more intense competition than Detroit and its suburbs, home to about 5.4 million people. There, two dozen clinics -- with another nine within a two-hour drive from Detroit -- fight for a dwindling number of patients and owners like Ms. Chelian find themselves struggling to survive.
But other scientists said they remained to be convinced that the paper published today demonstrates that Dolly's telomeres or those of the sheep cloned from embryo cells are shorter than normal. ''It is very difficult to distinguish between 22-kilobase-long telomeres and 19-kilobase-long telomeres, and that's really what we're talking about here,'' said Dr. Robert Weinberg, a cancer researcher at the Whitehead Institute of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''The resolution of the gels is not very good in that range.'' ''It's premature to draw rock-solid conclusions from this scant amount of data,'' Dr. Weinberg said. Dr. Judith Campisi, who studies cellular aging at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, said, ''I'm not convinced the results are meaningful.'' Dr. Huber Warner, deputy director of the biology of aging program at the National Institute on Aging in Bethesda, Md., called the results ''a little messy.'' A 20 percent difference in telomere length could just be within the ordinary variation for sheep, he said.
But the exact role of CRP remains subject to debate. Infectious-disease specialists note that the protein is part of the body's way of fending off microbes. When an infection begins, CRP latches onto microbial invaders, marking them for destruction by white blood cells. CRP is also released in chronic inflammation. One hypothesis says that in heart disease, a chronic inflammation of coronary arteries, the protein itself directly contributes to rupturing plaque and forming blood clots that block arteries, the components of a heart attack. But some say it remains possible that CRP is an indicator of a risk of heart attacks, not a cause. Many doctors say they urge patients with high CRP levels to lose weight if they are overweight, or stop smoking if they smoke. They may also use high CRP as the deciding factor in whether to prescribe a statin to patients whose cholesterol levels are borderline high.
They also weighed about the same and had no difference in diabetes rates, or in levels of insulin or blood sugar. It made sense to try the low-fat diet for cancer prevention, said Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, the director of the Women's Health Initiative. ''In the mid- to late 1980's, there was a body of literature that was suggestive that diet might impact the incidence of breast cancer and colorectal cancer,'' Dr. Nabel said. For example, studies found that women acquired a higher risk of those cancers if they moved to the United States from countries where incidence of the cancers was low and where diets were low in fat. And there were animal studies indicating that a high-fat diet could lead to more mammary cancer. But intriguing as those observations were, there was no direct, rigorous evidence that a low-fat diet was protective. The Women's Health Initiative study would be the first rigorous test to see if it was. The study investigators decided to follow heart disease rates, as well.
For family members, costs of treatment are rarely an issue, because they are mostly borne by taxpayers; most medical and nursing home care is paid for by Medicare and Medicaid. So some end-stage Alzheimer's patients get dialysis when their kidneys fail. Infections are treated with intravenous antibiotics. Patients are rushed to hospitals and intensive care units when they fall ill. Putting in a feeding tube can cost about $2,000, said Dr. Douglas Nelson, a geriatrician in Hickory, whose practice mostly consists of nursing home patients. Inserting a tube requires a consultation with a speech therapist to verify that food is entering the lungs and an X-ray by a radiologist that requires swallowing barium. The procedure itself is done in a hospital, with an anesthesiologist, and a gastroenterologist or a general surgeon. A feeding tube can prolong life in a nursing home, which quickly dwarfs the cost of inserting a tube. In North Carolina, Dr. Nelson said, it costs $150 a day on average, not counting medication, to care for a patient in a nursing home.
''You don't just dismiss a child in that age range,'' said Dr. Laura K. Bachrach, a pediatrics professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine. ''I think it is potentially medically dangerous.'' Dr. Bachrach recalled a 6-year-old who had came to her clinic with pubic hair and severe acne. The girl, she said, ''turned out to have a very large malignant adrenal tumor.'' The problem with the embrace of the early puberty hypothesis, skeptics like Dr. Bachrach say, is that the science underlying it is questionable. The single study, they say, does not demonstrate that puberty is starting earlier than in the past. In fact, they note, it is well documented that the age of onset of menstruation, the only date in the continuum of sexual development for which good data exist, has remained constant for half a century, occurring at about 12 years and 8 months  in white girls and a few months earlier in black girls.
''Bendectin was the archetypical case of junk science scuttling a perfectly safe product,'' said Dr. Michael Greene, the director of maternal-fetal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ''It was a sad episode in American jurisprudence.'' But Prof. David Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University in Virginia, said it was only a twisted sort of poetic justice to bring back Bendectin. ''There's no justice to the company who spent over $100 million in litigation, not to mention having their chief executives tied up in litigation for years and years,'' Professor Bernstein said. By 1980, 10 percent to 20 percent of pregnant women in the United States were taking Bendectin. But soon afterward, as the lawsuits mounted, Bendectin became tainted like thalidomide, the sedative that caused horrific birth defects when women took it early in pregnancy. Women who took Bendectin and had babies with birth defects, especially limb defects like missing fingers or missing bones from an arm or a leg, found it hard to believe  scientists who said that such things simply happen by chance and that the millions of women who took Bendectin had no more children with birth defects than those who did not take the drug. One out of every 2,000 American babies born each year has a limb defect and about 2.5 percent of babies have birth defects. Yet even if Bendectin was safe, as its defenders argued, few women or their doctors wanted to use it.
''I asked the question because I had seen people who were known as couch potatoes,'' Dr. Bouchard said. ''They were very sedentary, but when we measured them, there were quite a bit of differences among them. Some had a very nice cardiorespiratory endurance, and at the other end of the spectrum there were people who were very deteriorated from a fitness point of view. I said, 'Maybe this problem is caused by genetic differences.' '' The first study began in 1982, with a call for men and women from 18 to 30 who were totally inactive, with a lifetime history of being almost completely sedentary, but who were not particularly fat. One hundred and nine people volunteered. The investigators chose 30, looking for the most extreme examples of inactive people. ''We questioned them and we measured their activity in the last weeks, months and years,'' Dr. Bouchard said. ''They had desk jobs. They would drive a car and never walk. They never did any sport.''
For example, Dr. Michael R. Cohen, president of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, is thrilled with Dr. McClellan. His group has pressed for years for measures, like bar codes on prescription drugs, to prevent errors reading a doctor's handwriting or confusing drugs with similar names. Dr. McClellan has announced that the F.D.A. will be requiring those bar codes and that it will require companies to test their drug labels to be sure that the names and labels are not confusing. He is also requiring companies to report errors in prescribing and dispensing medications within 15 days of learning about them. ''We're seeing great things happen,'' Dr. Cohen said. ''I'm thrilled about it, and I'm not even a Republican.'' Perhaps Dr. McClellan's most vocal critic is Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group. He said he approved of some actions, like the bar codes, but despaired of most others, even Dr. McClellan's widely praised decision to put warning labels on ephedra, the dietary supplement that has been associated with deaths from heart attacks and strokes.
Even those with mild cognitive impairment struggle with the stigma of Alzheimer's. ''It's like alcoholism,'' Ms. Hoard said -- denied and hidden by family members and patients. Many, like a retired financial planner in Pittsburgh, have not told anyone outside their immediate family. The man explained, ''I try to still maintain an image that I'm a normal person.'' Thomas DeBaggio, 60, a herb grower in Arlington, Va., received a diagnosis of Alzheimer's three years ago, when he was only mildly impaired. He says that when he learned of his diagnosis, the local chapter of the Alzheimer's Association asked him to talk with another new patient. ''I called and his wife answered the phone,'' said Mr. DeBaggio, the author of a new book, ''Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's'' (Simon &amp; Schuster). ''I said who I was and that I had been asked to call him. She said: 'He doesn't want to see you. He doesn't want to talk to you. Goodbye.'
Using data from registries of birth defects, the researchers found that 9 percent of the babies conceived with those fertility treatments had defects compared to 4.2 percent of babies conceived without such treatments. The problems included abnormalities of the heart, kidneys and urogential system, as well as chromosomal defects. Dr. Allen A. Mitchell, an epidemiologist at the Boston University School of Public Health who wrote an editorial that accompanied the papers, said he had struggled to put their findings into perspective. Infertile couples who are contemplating fertility treatments should be told about the studies, he said, but the studies leave many questions unanswered. ''The bottom line is what does a couple who is contemplating these procedures make of all this?'' Dr. Mitchell said in a telephone interview. Most babies will not be affected, he said, noting that the studies indicate that 94 percent of all singleton babies born at term after fertility treatments have normal birth weights and that 91 percent have no major defects.
Others say that explaining why they are not doing tests can take more time than just doing them. ''I still listen to everyone's heart,'' said Dr. Stewart Rogers, an internist at Moses Cone Hospital in Greensboro, N.C. ''Why pick that fight? Why try to explain 10 years of evidence-based medicine so the patient will understand why I didn't do that test? The reason to listen to hearts is that it establishes our priestly majesty when you tell them about smoke alarms.'' Many say the annual visit at least gives patients a chance to establish a relationship with a doctor so they will have someone to call if they do get sick. ''I know that feeling of panic when someone has a real problem and they don't have an established doctor,'' said Dr. Christine Laine, a Philadelphia internist and senior deputy editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine. ''It's that sense of who to call if you wake up in the morning and see blood in your urine.''
One problem that women face, however, is that they are hobbled by myths about weight lifting, expecting the wrong things and, sometimes, expecting too much, exercise physiologists say. The worst myth, these researchers stress, is that women who lift weights risk growing muscles like a man's. Dr. Gary A. Dudley, an exercise physiologist at the University of Georgia and an author of the American College of Sports Medicine's statement on weight lifting, says he tries to dispel that notion by telling women to look around the gym at the women who are lifting heavy weights. ''That's the simplest answer -- just look around,'' he said. ''There's a girl who works in my lab who does pull-ups like a yo-yo. She does not have 26-inch arms like Arnold used to have,'' he said, referring to Arnold Schwarzenegger. ''They're just not there.'' Somehow, that message has not reached the general public, Dr. Kraemer said. Even his 22-year-old daughter believed it, asking Dr. Kraemer to help her and her friends by suggesting a program that would help them get fit without getting big.
CRP levels are low in healthy young people -- usually less than one milligram per liter of blood -- but they rise with age and with obesity, diabetes, smoking and a sedentary life. If people lose weight, stop smoking, exercise or take oral diabetes drugs, their CRP levels fall. But a third of the population has levels greater than three milligrams, and levels that high have been associated with heart disease risk, Dr. Ridker said. Even before the new findings, evidence had been mounting that CRP and heart disease were somehow linked. Scientists have developed hypotheses to explain why, proposing that the protein could cause plaque to develop in coronary arteries, lead plaque to burst open or bring on the formation of blood clots that then block arteries and cause heart attacks. Some drug companies have started programs to develop drugs that make a specific target of CRP and prevent its synthesis.
Dr. Friedman gave an analogy: ''Imagine the average I.Q. was 100 and that 5 percent of the population had an I.Q. of 140 or greater and were considered to be geniuses. Now let's say that education improves and the average I.Q. increases to 107 and 10 percent of the population has an I.Q. of above 140. ''You could present the data in two ways,'' he said. ''You could say that the average I.Q. is up seven points or you could say that because of improved education the number of geniuses has doubled.'' He added, ''The whole obesity debate is equivalent to drawing conclusions about national education programs by saying that the number of geniuses has doubled.'' Not everyone agrees. ''It' s one thing to talk about statistics and another to talk about what's happening to individuals,'' said Dr. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University. ''Everyone notices that there are more overweight people now.''
The report, from a huge federal study called the Women's Health Initiative, raises important questions about how much even the most highly motivated people can change their eating habits and whether the relatively small changes that they can make really have a substantial effect on health. The study, of nearly 49,000 women who were randomly assigned to follow a low-fat diet or not, found that the diet did not make a significant difference in development of the two cancers or heart disease. But there were limitations to the findings: the women assigned to the low-fat diet, despite extensive and expensive counseling, never reached their goal of eating 20 percent fat in the first year --only 31 percent of them got their dietary fat that low. And the study did not examine the effects of different types of fat -- a fact that critics say is a weakness at a time when doctors are advising heart patients to reduce saturated fat in the diet, not overall fats.
Other questions researchers are asking include whether the five-year tamoxifen period is optimal. It may be better, for example, to take the drug for two years, or three years, and then switch to an aromatase inhibitor. Perhaps it is better to take an aromatase inhibitor all along. Such questions are being studied, Dr. Ingle said, in clinical trials around the world. But, cancer experts said, the fact that questions remain does not to take away from the importance of the discovery. ''The whole point is, it is an advance, conceptually, biologically,'' Dr. Osborne said. ''The standard has been to stop tamoxifen after five years and do nothing else. Now we have something else.''
If scientists want to develop new supplies of embryonic stem cells, they may have to take the bold and controversial step of creating human embryos expressly for research, many leading fertility experts say. Tens of thousands of embryos are frozen at fertility centers, and a widespread assumption in the debate over stem cell research has been that scientists can use them. But in clinics around the country, embryologists and doctors tell the same story: almost every embryo is spoken for. The vast majority of couples use their frozen embryos, or plan to use them, in attempts at pregnancy. It may be that embryos will become available if there are concerted efforts to encourage couples to donate them. But so far, very few couples have agreed to do so. An alternative, creating human embryos and nurturing them solely for experiments that will destroy them leaves even many supporters of the research deeply uneasy.
And now, the scientists say, the work is starting to unmask that virus's secrets. In gene-swapping experiments, the scientists found that small substitutions weakened the reconstructed virus so that it could no longer replicate in the lungs of mice, kill animals, or attach itself to human lung cells in the lab. The ultimate goal, Dr. Taubenberger says, is to make a checklist of changes to look for in the bird viruses. ''Now you have all these viruses going around and we don't know, is it going to adapt to humans? Is it going to cause a pandemic? We don't understand the rules,'' he said. ''There is a lot of science to go.''
Dr. Huber Warner, who directs the biology of aging program at the National Institute on Aging, said that it was as if dieting flies ''put on a suit of armor.'' ''It seems like the dietary restriction puts the flies into a different kind of state where they are temporarily able to resist damaging events so that they survive rather than die,'' Dr. Warner said. Dr. James W. Vaupel, a demographer at the Max Planck Institute for Demography in Rostock, Germany, said the findings put decades of research on the effects of calorie restriction in a new light. ''We've known for a long time that dietary restriction increases survival,'' Dr. Vaupel said. ''What we haven't known is that it's never too late.'' It is a finding, he explained, that required huge numbers of flies to give the researchers valid data on death rates per day. That, in turn, allowed them to discover when the diet effect emerged.
Public health officials tried in vain to contain its spread. In Philadelphia, people were exhorted not to cough, sneeze or spit in public. But the virus spread anyway. On Oct. 3, Philadelphia closed all of its schools, churches, theaters and pool halls. Still, within a month, nearly 11,000 Philadelphians died of influenza. Anyone who doubts that flu deaths can be horrific need only read the memoirs of physicians like Dr. Victor C. Vaughan, who treated influenza victims in 1918. Dr. Vaughan, a former president of the American Medical Association, was summoned by the surgeon general to Camp Devens, near Boston, where the flu struck in September. He later described the scene in his memoirs. The men, Dr. Vaughan wrote, ''are placed on the cots until every bed is full, yet others crowd in.'' ''Their faces soon wear a bluish cast; a distressing cough brings up the blood stained sputum,'' he continued.
But Dr. Rawlins is not impressed. Those awards, he said, ''are relatively minor and mostly unrelated to reproductive endocrinology and infertility.'' The laparoscopy award and the Sigma Xi award, he said, are given by university faculties to promising students. They are not national awards. Dr. Caruso agreed with Dr. Rawlins's characterization of his awards. ''That's correct,'' he said. ''It's not that he doesn't have these titles,'' Dr. Rawlins said. ''But the public has no clue to what the real weight of them is. In a jury of his peers, he is a simple practitioner whose credentials have been inflated into something fantastic to attract patients.'' Many centers attract patients by offering money-back guarantees, which can be rife with abuse, critics said. Most patients, in a sort of bait-and-switch scheme, are told when they show up that they are not eligible for the guarantee, said Dr. Behr of Stanford. Only the youngest and healthiest, who are most likely to get pregnant, get it. And then, he said, doctors are under pressure to get them pregnant -- fast.
No one disputes that obesity poses health risks that include diabetes, heart disease and sleep apnea. But based on the recently published research, those whose weight put them at a moderately greater risk of death turn out to be a narrowly defined group: people under age 70 with a body mass index of 35 or above. That group constitutes less than 16 percent of the population. (A person 5 feet six inches who weighs at least 217 pounds would fall into that category.) Still, obesity researchers and the Centers for Disease Control say that it would be folly to ignore the fact that one-third of American adults are now officially obese -- with body mass indexes of 30 or higher -- and that another one-third are statistically overweight, meaning they have B.M.I.'s of 25 or higher. (For a five-foot six-inch person, a B.M.I. of 25 means weighing 155 pounds, while a B.M.I. of 30 means weighing 186.)
''Many studies have demonstrated that short-term weight loss has beneficial effects on risk factors such as high blood pressure and cholesterol,'' the institute writes in its description of the study. ''However, observational studies have raised concerns about negative effects of weight loss and weight cycling. Some of these studies suggest increased, not decreased, mortality; however, most cannot distinguish voluntary from involuntary weight loss.'' Dr. Hirsch said that, in the meantime, he wished the message could get out that truly fat people really are different from people of normal weight. ''There is some sort of extraordinary genetic and environmental mix that has programmed people to be set for greater fat storage,'' he said. ''Of course they overeat. But the significant issue is that they have another illness and the symptom of that is the overeating.'' ''A reduced fat person is not a normal person,'' Dr. Hirsch said. ''If you take two women who both weigh 130 pounds, but one used to weigh 200 pounds and one always weighed 130, they are not the same.''
Dr. John Boice, the scientific director of the International Epidemiology Institute in Rockville, Md., mentions other complications. ''Often the exposure you are looking for, whether it is indoor radon or pesticides or solvents in the water, are so low that it is difficult to find an effect even if one is there.'' In addition, he said, it is hard even to find people who may have been exposed to low levels of a pollutant 10 or 20 years ago. ''People move, they migrate,'' he said. Dr. Michael Gallo, the associate director for cancer prevention at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School's cancer institute, said the same. ''Looking for direct causation is going to be impossible,'' he said. Indeed, beyond cigarette smoking, excessive sun exposure, radon, very high concentrations of arsenic in water and, possibly, air pollution, very few environmental causes of cancer have been proven definitively. But advocates who pushed for the Long Island study are not easily dissuaded. Dr. Gammon said she had been meeting with the women, trying to explain the limits of science. ''They don't want to hear it,'' she said.
Dr. Beckman said a doctor recently called him, stung by his low scores and asking how it could be that his patients did not like him. ''We looked at his survey results and the area where he was low was the question of, Did the doctor spend enough time with you?'' Dr. Beckman said. ''I told him a bit about how a person feels that enough time is spent. You have to uncover the heart of their problems.'' Of course, Dr. Beckman said, ''everyone thinks they're listening'' to patients. But one method does work, he told the doctor. ''You use continuers. As you're working with people, you say 'uh huh' three times.'' He gave an example: ''The patient says, 'I've been having chest pains.' '' Instead of jumping in and suggesting tests, the doctor says, ''Uh huh.'' The patient says, ''I've also been having headaches.'' The doctor says, ''Uh huh.'' So the patient says: ''It all started when my brother died of an aneurysm in the brain. And I wonder if it's related.''
At this point, ''we have created the world's most expensive, least applicable procedure,'' said Dr. Ralph Damiano Jr., chief of cardiothoracic surgery at the Milton S. Hershey Medical Center in Hershey Park, Pa., where he does robotic surgery.  ''We have taken the first steps on a long road.'' Dr. Robert E. Michler, who does robotic surgery at Ohio State, where he is chief of cardiothoracic surgery and transplantation, agreed. ''I call this the Model T of surgical robotic technology,'' he said. ''By no means is this the final answer.'' But, the doctors say, the still-primitive technology shows them that robotic surgery has a dazzling potential. ''Nobody has ever seen anything like this before,'' Dr. Wolf said. ''It's elegant, it's beautiful, it's truly awe inspiring.'' Dr. Wolf and others who are testing the procedure in the United States have also done it in Germany, where less-stringent government regulations have allowed them to do entire bypasses with robots. So, they say, they know it can succeed in simple cases.
Carmela Coyle, the senior vice president for policy at the American Hospital Association, acknowledged that more doctors and more hospitals led to more care, but she asked: ''The question is, what level of care is the right level of care? We should ask the questions, have the conversation, but not jump to the conclusion that more is better or less is better.'' But other doctors not connected with the Dartmouth research say that the body of evidence pointing to overuse is compelling. ''If you want to predict the amount of use, all you have to know is the supply,'' said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, president of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit group in Boston. He says he regards the Dartmouth research as the most important in this area in the past quarter-century. ''When all is said and done,'' Dr. Berwick said, ''the people who have been most serious about it rarely think we are underresourced. The evidence to my mind is so strong. More is not better, and it often is very, very much worse.''
Patients here say they have mixed emotions. They complain about rushed primary care doctors but readily admit that they seek multiple specialists and multiple procedures. The primary care doctors are often irritatingly busy, patients say. ''In waiting rooms sometimes they are standing against the wall,'' said Marvin Luxenberg, a retired lawyer who lives in nearby Boynton Beach. Then, he said, ''when you get in to see the doctor, you get just three or four minutes of time.'' Dr. Colton says he found a way to give his patients more time. He joined a ''concierge'' practice, in which patients pay an annual fee in addition to the normal charges for medical services. Dr. Colton's group, MDVIP, charges patients $1,500 a year and limits the number of patients each doctor sees. But not everyone wants to pay that kind of fee. Many patients just spend their time in specialists' offices. Each specialist handles a different aspect of their care, with no one coordinating it.
Judge Pointer did not return telephone calls yesterday and it was not immediately clear how he would respond to the motion. A clerk said he would review the matter on Monday. Richard Eittreim, a lawyer for Bristol-Myers Squibb, said the plaintiffs' lawyers' complaints were ''ridiculous.'' He dismissed the entire issue as a desperate ploy of lawyers who see that the tide has turned against them. Dr. Tugwell referred questions to a lawyer for the science panel, John M. Kobayashi of Denver. Mr. Kobayashi, did not return several telephone calls, but released a letter urging reporters to ''evaluate all of the facts regarding this matter, including all written submissions and argument to the court, before reporting a one-sided version of these events.'' He did not respond in detail to the assertions in the motion filed yesterday. A spokesman for the lawyers who filed the motion said they, too, would not comment.
One student, Dr. Richard McPherson, a professor of clinical pathology, began the discussion. Although he already was a full-fledged scientist, he was required to take the course because he is studying for a master's degree in biostatistics. ''To me, this points out that you should always look at more than one job at a time. You can just knock some out right away,'' he said. ''This relationship is starting out on the wrong track. This is fraud. It sounds unethical. It might be illegal. You start to worry, Is this the way it's going to be? Is there another agenda with this guy?'' Daniel Lineberry, a Ph.D. student in pharmacy, saw it differently. ''I think there's a greater good. I think go ahead and put it on there,'' he said. ''It benefits the whole department. The money's there. Why not spend it?'' Others said they had encountered situations when equipment was needed unexpectedly. So maybe the equipment would be useful to the student, eventually. Maybe it's not so outrageous to ask for it.
About 4 percent of surgery patients die. The death rate from putting in an endovascular graft is about 1.5 percent. But researchers worry that those grafts may not provide lasting results and are awaiting data from large clinical trials comparing the two methods. ''Some of us think the long-term benefits of grafts are not proven,'' said Dr. Lederle, an internist who is directing one of the clinical trials and takes no money from the industry. But grafts, he said, are a huge market, widely promoted. ''This has created tension in the field,'' he added. Dr. Calonge of the task force said the question for insurers was going to be whether to pay for the screening. He knows that world well, he says, because until a few years ago he was the chief of preventive medicine for the Kaiser Permanente health care company in Colorado and had to decide whether new tests and services should be provided.
When scientists announced this month that a widely anticipated federal study of breast cancer had failed to find links to pollution or other environmental factors, attention was again focused on the prevalence of the disease on Long Island, where the study was based. For years, it has been widely thought that rates of breast cancer on Long Island are unusually high. But, contrary to popular belief, they are not. The rates on Long Island are not much different from those of the rest of the country -- and a number of areas in the Northeast and elsewhere have higher rates. But the perception of an epidemic has persisted like a suburban legend. Figures that scientists say have no basis in fact, like a breast cancer rate that is 30 percent higher than the national average, have been bandied about at public meetings, and repeated by breast cancer patients, politicians and newspapers, including The New York Times.
Dr. Blair noted that such decisions were difficult because they were, in part, political, balancing the costs of getting rid of the chemical against the benefits. But, he said, regulatory decisions require reliable scientific data. ''You can only make a decision if you know something,'' he said. So the studies continue. ''We want to know what to worry about, so at least we can make rational decisions,'' Dr. Blair said. Gerald N. Wogan, a chemist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, takes a different approach. He, like most other scientists, worries that the public is overly concerned about cancer risks from the chemicals they are exposed to. But, he says, the question of how environmentally induced cancers arise is a puzzle that he would like to solve. Dr. Wogan became interested in pollutants and cancer when he began studying the effects of aflatoxin, produced by mold on peanuts. The toxin caused liver cancer in rats and, Dr. Wogan and others showed, it also causes liver cancer in people. But exposure to aflatoxin was just part of the risk.
Addressing a major unknown in the longstanding debate over mammograms, a new study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute found that the screening test contributed to a pronounced drop in the death rate from breast cancer. The study, being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, concludes that 28 to 65 percent of the sharp decrease in breast cancer deaths from 1990 to 2000 was due to mammograms. The rest was attributed to powerful new drugs to treat breast cancer. More than 80 percent of women 40 and over get mammograms now, and Dr. Russell Harris, a professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina and a member of the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which issues medical practice guidelines, said the new finding meant that women could feel confident the screening played a role in preventing breast cancer deaths. That is not something Dr. Harris would have said before the study was published.
Fertility experts say this trend is driven in part by the fact that medicine now has more to offer. Women can have babies even after menopause, with donor eggs. Men who produce almost no sperm can become fathers with intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Couples who would have been turned down by fertility centers in the past are welcomed now. And some doctors tell women they can become pregnant by augmenting traditional treatments with unorthodox remedies, including Viagra suppositories and ''embryo glue.'' Attempts at in vitro fertilization have soared, rising to 107,587 in 2001 from 64,036 in 1996. Fertility clinics have multiplied, offering a wide variety of tests and treatments. The cost of joining egg and sperm has jumped accordingly. With the extra items adding to the base price of in vitro, an attempt can end up costing as much as $25,000. Yet some experts worry that the fertility frenzy has gone too far. Many patients, they say, are vulnerable and desperate, and all too easily convinced that the next test, or the next clinic, might work miracles.
Another Institute of Medicine committee gave the same advice in 2000. ''We were calling for better monitoring,'' said Dr. Harold Sox, the editor of The Annals of Internal Medicine and the committee's chairman. The new effort to build a research database involves careful health assessments of troops before and after the war, including information that is essential for research on health effects. Doctors will use a structured set of questions and exams so that the clinical data will be comparable. ''Part of the problem we had with the Persian Gulf war is that V.A. physicians were not familiar with the exposures the troops had had, and they could not relate to vets coming back and saying things like they took these pills and didn't know what they were,'' Dr. Roswell said. ''Some vets complained that the doctors were not familiar with the issues of gulf war deployment.'' The Defense Department is also assessing the air, water and soil wherever troops are deployed and keeping records of who was exposed to what. And it is telling service members exactly what vaccines and drugs they are getting to prevent or treat diseases and those records too are being kept in a central database.
''There was this enormous dissent 10 years ago,'' Dr. Lauer said. Many medical experts took issue with the idea of aggressively treating patients like older people or people who had no symptoms of heart disease but whose cholesterol levels were elevated. ''It was felt that the evidence was not there to support this very aggressive management.'' But the completion of at least five major clinical trials, most using statins to sharply lower cholesterol levels, proved the skeptics wrong, researchers said. They showed conclusively that reducing cholesterol levels could lower death rates and prevent heart attacks. ''The driving force is the data that have been accumulating over the past eight years and that have been so compelling,'' Dr. Lenfant said. Dr. Lauer added that ''the whole cholesterol picture has really changed. There now is no doubt that cholesterol reduction saves lives and prevents heart attacks and it probably prevents bypass surgery and angioplasty. Now the question is, How do we best implement it?''
''There are plenty of doctors who will prescribe it,'' said Dr. Harman said. ''It's a tremendous scam.''
''If it was floating in water with light underneath, it might look like a speck of dust,'' said Dr. William Gibbons, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Eastern Virginia. The defining feature of a blastocyst is that it has a real structure, made of a ball of cells, the inner cell mass, encased in a sphere. The sphere becomes the placenta if the blastocyst is implanted in a woman's uterus, and the inner cell mass becomes the fetus. But at the blastocyst stage, the inner cell mass consists of cells that are still indeterminate, not yet committed to becoming any particular cell type. They are the stem cells, which can in theory develop into any of the body's tissues and organs. Stem cells from a clone would be genetically identical to the person who contributed cells to make the embryo. Some scientists want to use stem cells to study how genes cause disease. Others say they may one day use stem cells to grow replacement tissues that are identical to the patient's own cells.
''I've gotten more letters on mental health and suicide prevention than in an other area,'' he said. ''People felt like they were alone.'' Last summer, he released a report on sexuality that advocated sex education, saying there was insufficient research to back claims that courses teaching abstinence until marriage delayed sexual activity among unmarried teenagers. A spokesman for President Bush disputed that finding, and said the president believed that teaching abstinence was the best way to prevent unwanted pregnancy and AIDS. Sexuality, Dr. Satcher said, ''has always been a controversial subject.'' He reported on the science, he said. ''Not everybody likes the science, but I tried to report where the science is now.'' Dr. Satcher, 60, grew up in rural Alabama, attending racially segregated schools. His parents never finished elementary school. After attending Morehouse College in Atlanta on a full scholarship, he went to medical school at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, one of two black students. Before taking the position of surgeon general, Dr. Satcher was director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The first strategy is only starting to be investigated because the discoveries are so new. But the second strategy is well under way. In mice, said James Allison, chairman of the immunology program at Sloan-Kettering, some cancers went away after just a single injection of an antibody to CTLA-4. Other cancers required a vaccine, as well, to bolster the newly unleashed immune attack. But then, Dr. Allison found, even the most intractable tumors in mice were destroyed. Dr. Allison licensed the technique to Bristol-Myers Squibb, which is working with Medarex to see if the method will work in humans. But while the work showed that the immune system can destroy cancers, at least in mice, it leaves unanswered the question that plagues many patients: Did a weakened immune system, possibly weakened by stress, cause cancer in the first place? Cancer immunologists are skeptical. ''There is absolutely no evidence for that association,'' Dr. Pardoll said.
''We tested, trained and retested them with the same program,'' Dr. Bouchard said. ''And we have found the same thing in each of the clinical centers. There are high responders and low responders.'' A measurement of a training response is the increase in the amount of oxygen people use when they try to push themselves hard. The more oxygen taken in, the more that enters the blood and is delivered to muscles and so the more intensely the person can exercise, running faster for example. The average increase after training was 400 milliliters of oxygen, Dr. Bouchard said. But some people had no increase and in some the increase was more than double the average. The range was zero milliliters to 1,000 milliliters. The standard deviation was 200, meaning that two-thirds of the people increased their oxygen consumption by 200 to 600 milliliters of oxygen. ''These are huge differences, but within families, you have aggregation,'' Dr. Bouchard said. He explained: ''Children tend to respond the way their parents do. Siblings tend to respond like each other. The heritability of responsiveness to exercise training was at least as great as it is for body weight, blood pressure and cholesterol.''
The study, known as the Women's Health Initiative, involved 16,000 postmenopausal women. Half were assigned to take Prempro and the others took a placebo. The study, which had been scheduled to continue until 2005, was stopped in July because scientists noticed that the women taking hormone replacement therapy were at slightly increased risk of breast cancer, heart attacks, strokes and blood clots and that those risks were larger than the drugs' benefits, a slight decrease in hip fractures and in colon cancer. But as many as 40 percent of the women in the study had already stopped taking their medications, with some having taken them for months and others for years. When Dr. Chlebowski looked at what had happened to that group, he found that its members had the same additional risk of breast cancer as women who had taken Prempro faithfully from when they joined the study until the day they were told to stop.
The news release on the first two dozen people to enter the vaccine safety study came from the Alzheimer's Association, an advocacy group, at the World Alzheimer Congress 2000 meeting last week in Washington. Dr. William Thies, the association's vice president for medical and scientific affairs, said: ''The attraction of this whole business for us is that this is essentially a new approach. There is tremendous interest in it.'' But Dr. Thies added that the clinical research was in its earliest stages. ''We all know there is a potential for any of these products to be derailed,'' he said. One measure of the importance of data from research studies is whether they are published or accepted for publication. Dr. Barrett said American Home Products would not consider trying to publish the safety results on two dozen patients in a medical journal. ''I'm not sure what you would publish,'' he said.
The Weight Watchers study, published in 2003 in The Journal of the American Medical Association, involved 423 people who weighed an average of 205 pounds. Half the participants were randomly assigned to attend Weight Watchers meetings and follow the program. The other half tried to lose weight on their own. After two years, the participants in Weight Watchers had lost an average of 6.4 pounds. The other group had lost no weight. Neither group showed a change in blood pressure, cholesterol, blood glucose or insulin. ''We found no such evaluations of Jenny Craig or L.A. Weight Loss,'' Dr. Wadden and Dr. Tsai wrote. Kent Coykendall, a vice president of strategic planning and business development for Jenny Craig, said the company had begun a randomized study of 70 people on the program. But in the meantime, he said, Jenny Craig has the records of tens of thousands of participants attesting to the fact that they lost weight -- ''a plethora of real data on real people in the real world under real circumstances,'' Mr. Coykendall said.
''Everywhere I go,'' she said, ''teachers, parents, everybody, says girls are starting to go through puberty earlier.'' In 1997, her study was published in the journal Pediatrics. And the furor began. Some pediatrics professors, like Dr. Melvin M. Grumbach of the University of California at San Francisco, praised the study, saying in an interview, ''This is an incredible piece of work.'' Dr. Grumbach immediately incorporated it into a chapter he wrote on puberty for the 1998 edition of a major textbook, ''Williams Textbook of Endocrinology.'' Others responded with disbelief. ''I thought the study was scientifically flawed,'' said Dr. Robert L.  Rosenfield, a pediatrics professor at the University of Chicago and the author of a chapter on female puberty in a leading textbook, ''Pediatric Endocrinology.'' For example, Dr. Rosenfield said, the girls were not randomly selected but had happened to go to their pediatricians -- some, perhaps, because ''their parents were a little bit worried about pubic hair or breast development.''
On the other hand, Dr. Scolnick said, now that the clotting question has been raised, none of the findings to date are enough to prove that the issue is fully resolved. That lack of proof is why the F.D.A. demanded that Merck explain both sides of the hypothesis, telling doctors and patients that it is not known whether naproxen protects against heart attacks or Vioxx makes them more likely. In the meantime, Dr. Geis, the group vice president for clinical research of Pharmacia, said his company's drug, Celebrex, was getting tarred with the same brush. Pharmacia's studies never showed any increase in heart attacks or strokes in patients taking Celebrex, he said. ''We say, you must look at the data with the individual drugs and not make a sweeping statement about all cox-2 inhibitors,'' Dr. Geis said. He added that the company constantly heard from doctors and patients who were worried that Celebrex caused heart disease. And, he said, every time he addresses a medical meeting, he is asked about it. In question-and-answer sessions after his talks, he said, someone always says, ''Tell us about the cardiovascular effects.''
The mother, Sharon Terry of Sharon, Mass., had noticed the rash a year earlier but assumed it was of no consequence and would go away. Finally, she asked a dermatologist what it was. ''As soon as he looked at it, he said, 'pseudoxanthoma elasticum,' '' Ms. Terry recalled. ''Then he glanced at my son, who was 4 at the time, and said, 'Gee, he has it too.' '' Ms. Terry, who has a master's degree in religious studies, and her husband, Patrick, who manages a construction company, had never heard of the rare genetic disorder, which causes mineralization of tissue. They spent the weekend at the library of the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester reading everything they could find about it. And they quickly realized that not much was known. It was rare -- affecting an estimated one person in 25,000 to 50,000. And it had an array of symptoms.
Breast cancer rates fell sharply in 2003, and the lower rate remained in 2004, researchers are reporting today. The finding, they say, fits with a hypothesis they advanced last December when they had data only from 2003. At that time, national data showed that breast cancer rates fell by nearly 15 percent in the 18 months from July 2002 through December 2003. The most likely reason for the fall in rates, the investigators, led by Donald A. Berry of M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said, was that large numbers of women stopped taking hormone therapy for menopause. And that therapy, a combination of estrogen and progestins, can increase the incidence of breast cancer. Now, with the 2004 data, the researchers say the effect is less likely to be an anomaly. If rates had gone up again, they explain, it would have meant that their hypothesis was incorrect. The analysis relied on ''statistical sleuthing,'' said Dr. Berry, head of the division of quantitative sciences at M.D. Anderson and senior author of the paper published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Dr. Guarente admits that he would have little choice but to use this roundabout strategy. ''I don't see how else we could get something like that to market,'' he said.
For companies like Glaxo Wellcome and Bristol-Myers Squibb, as well as Pfizer, the path is clear. Last April, they and seven other large drug companies joined forces with the Wellcome Trust, a medical research charity, and several leading academic centers, to compare human DNA segments and find the places where variations occur. The companies will use these variations, called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs, and pronounced ''snips,'' to try to develop the precisely targeted drugs of the future. Their goal is to identify 300,000 such landmarks along the human DNA within two years and make the results public. On Nov. 21, the group, called the SNP Consortium, published on the Internet its first group of SNP's, identifying 2,279 of them and describing their precise sites on human chromosomes. But more is involved than just finding SNP's. Companies are also worried about the bottom line: How much will it cost to find these alterations in genes?
At first, plaque grows from the inner wall of the artery out, Dr. Libby said, making the artery thicker but not narrower. Only at the very end of this process does the plaque start to grow inward, narrowing the artery. But most fatal heart attacks, Dr. Libby said, occur when one of the earlier-stage plaques pops open. Blood pours out, clots, obstructs the artery, and a heart attack ensues. ''The blood clot forms where the plaque opens,'' Dr. Libby said. ''It's revolutionized the way we look at the disease.'' The idea of looking at heart disease by looking at the diameter of an artery, he added, ''is like trying to learn about a doughnut by looking at the hole.'' Dr. Brewer said, ''You can get enormous changes in vessel wall pathology and little change in the lumen, the vessel diameter.'' That is why measuring the volume of plaque in artery walls can be so important to observing the progress of heart disease, he added.
Still, Dr. Utian, of the menopause society, said that too many companies were sending a message he paraphrased this way: ''The Women's Health Initiative has shown the other stuff is garbage, but we have the answer.'' He cited an e-mail promotion with the headline: ''Women Search for a Safe Alternative to Hormonal Replacement Therapy. Scientific Research Already Has the Answer.'' The company, SuperNutrition, says its vitamin and herb combination called Menopause Multiple Blend prevents hot flashes, strengthens bone, protects against heart disease, prevents memory problems and, best of all, is ''safe and natural.'' Makers of other products also advertise benefits that groups like the National Institutes of Health say are not demonstrated. Whole World Botanicals advertises a Peruvian herb, maca, asserting that it can relieve symptoms of menopause and even help with ''premenstrual syndrome'' in younger women. The herb, its maker claims, ''contains no plant hormones, unlike soy/genistein and black cohosh.''
''Does it make sense to tell people they should not be allowed to have a scan because they will be overanxious?'' she asked. ''Does the chance of saving your own life outweigh the chance that the tumor is benign?'' The customers who flock to CAT Scan 2000's units say, in so many words, that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Gary Cooper, a nurse in Columbus, compared his body to his car. ''I've got vehicles with 320,000 miles on them,'' Mr. Cooper, 56, said. ''They don't get there by my not taking good care of them.'' Tanya Ingle, 47, also a nurse, said she wanted a chest X-ray because she used to smoke and her uncle had lung cancer. Her doctor refused, telling her there was no medical indication. So, she said, when she saw fliers for the CAT Scan 2000 unit at her hospital she called for an appointment and came for a lung scan.
But Dr. Monto said that there may be another, easier way. A few years ago, the province of Ontario in Canada began offering free flu shots to everyone, including children. Now scientists are starting to look at what happened to the spread of the disease there. Dr. Monto said it would have been nice if the program had been set up by scientists in the first place, so that there could be rigorous before-and-after comparisons and so that someone would have been keeping track of who actually got the vaccine. As with so much else that happens in public health, though, ''it was a political decision, not a scientific decision, to do this,'' he said. Still, Dr. Monto added, ''we don't really need a national demonstration project if we can figure out what happened in Ontario.''
THE PROSTATE
People who worry about cell phones' causing brain cancer, scientists said, were unlikely to be assuaged by the new studies and statements about microwave energy. The problem, said Dr. Barnett S. Kramer, director of the Office of Medical Applications of Research at the National Institutes of Health, is a limitation of science. ''You can prove that if something has an effect it is below your ability to detect it, but the nature of science is that you can't prove zero effect,'' Dr. Kramer noted. In the end, he said, the population becomes divided. ''For believers, no proof is necessary. And for skeptics, no proof is possible,'' Dr. Kramer  said. ''Somewhere in between, hopefully, are the bulk of the people who will weigh the evidence.''
Dr. Lauren Schnaper, a surgeon who directs the comprehensive breast care center at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center, wrote the protocol for the lumpectomy study, along with Dr. Hughes. But she soon found that few doctors told their elderly patients that the study was an option. ''It was hard to convince physicians to enter their patients in the study,'' Dr. Schnaper said. ''They told me it was a controversial question.'' But Dr. Schnaper and others made persuading doctors their mission, traveling to medical meetings and repeatedly urging doctors to enroll patients. After five years, the researchers reached their goal: enrolling 640 women who were 70 or older when their breast cancers were discovered and who had small tumors that had not spread beyond their breasts. The women were randomly assigned to have a lumpectomy followed by radiation therapy or lumpectomy alone. All the women took tamoxifen. Now it is just a matter of waiting one to three years to see if there is a difference in outcome between the women who had radiation and those who did not.
Obesity, Dr. Friedman says, is a problem; fat people are derided and they have health risks like diabetes and heart disease. But it does no one any good to exaggerate the extent of obesity or to blame the obese for being fat. ''Before calling it an epidemic, people really need to understand what the numbers do and don't say,'' he said. I BEG TO DIFFER
''If you are sitting on top of a big cushy ball, there is no way to make it so that your body will support itself efficiently,'' he said. Novices, said Dr. Hagberg, tend to ''sit straight up, with all their weight on their butt,'' and no wonder they are in pain. Another mistake that beginners often make is to set the seat so low that their legs are scrunched or, less often, so high that the riders rocks from side to side. ''Knee problems in the making,'' the experts say. Richard Schwinn, a custom bicycle-frame builder who happens to be a great-grandson of the founder of Schwinn bicycles, said that many people get the idea in childhood that their feet must touch the ground when they sit on a bicycle seat. But that means that the seat is so low that the cyclist's knees are under constant strain, to say nothing of making pedaling inefficient, said Mr. Schwinn, who owns Waterford Precision Cycles in Waterford, Wis..
Even the critics of widespread testing are not necessarily advocating that people forgo it. But they say people should know what the demonstrated benefits are, and the risks, because once people know they have a cancer they usually seek treatment, and the treatments can be debilitating, even life-threatening. ''This is the 'Emperor's New Clothes' of American medicine,'' said Dr. Clifton K. Meador, director of the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance, a cooperative program between the two medical schools in Nashville. Dr. Meador, who has written on the drawbacks of screening tests, said the general enthusiasm for screening tests reminded him of what a medical resident once replied when asked to define a well person: ''Someone who has not been completely worked up.'' Such concerns became an issue recently when scientists in Denmark reported that their analysis of mammography studies had found that the tests did not lower the overall death rate from breast cancer and that, as a group, women who had the tests ended up with more surgery, including mastectomies, more radiation and chemotherapy than women who were not screened. Their analysis is now being studied and debated, but, many medical experts said, at the very least it points out that even mammography may produce the same problems as other screening tests.
The Food and Drug Administration has told a researcher that he cannot be part of an advisory panel that will meet early next year to review the safety of a class of drugs, COX-2 inhibitors, used to treat arthritis and pain. The reason, the agency said, is he publicly stated that he thought one of these drugs caused heart problems and that Pfizer, its maker, knew that and was covering it up. The scientist, Dr. Curt D. Furberg, a professor of public health sciences at Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C., was not barred forever from the panel, an F.D.A. spokeswoman said. Instead, Dr. Furberg was asked not to participate when it took up an issue in which he was seen to have an intellectual conflict of interest. ''This is a routine procedure,'' said Victoria Kao, the spokeswoman. ''They look at the members that will make up the committee, and they review them for each case to see whether they have a conflict of interest, financial or intellectual.''
It is clear that the old lactic acid theory cannot explain what is happening to muscles, Dr. Brooks and others said. Yet, Dr. Brooks said, even though coaches often believed in the myth of the lactic acid threshold, they ended up training athletes in the best way possible to increase their mitochondria. ''Coaches have understood things the scientists didn't,'' he said. Through trial and error, coaches learned that athletic performance improved when athletes worked on endurance, running longer and longer distances, for example. That, it turns out, increased the mass of their muscle mitochondria, letting them burn more lactic acid and allowing the muscles to work harder and longer. Just before a race, coaches often tell athletes to train very hard in brief spurts. That extra stress increases the mitochondria mass even more, Dr. Brooks said, and is the reason for improved performance. And the scientists? They took much longer to figure it out.
Dr. McKay said learning to make embryo clones for research could help people who want to make babies that are clones. But he added that scientists did not always do everything that is possible. ''I really don't want to comment on the slippery slope,'' he said. Dr. Cibelli, too, focused on the Koreans' report. ''Now you have the demonstration that everyone was waiting for,'' he said. ''Whether this approach will be applicable to making babies, I don't know. And I hope I never find out.''
Doctors do not need an M.R.I. to diagnose and treat stroke, said Dr. Lee H. Schwamm, vice chairman of the department of neurology at Massachusetts General Hospital. But, Dr. Schwamm added, if the question is whether it helps, there is one reply: ''By all means.'' It has still not been shown, though, that M.R.I. scans actually improve outcomes. It might depend on the circumstances and the hospital, said Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz, deputy director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. But some who use M.R.I. scans, and who have studied them in research, say the system has to change. They say enough is known about the scans to advocate having them at every major medical center that will treat stroke patients. ''All these problems could be solved if there was a will to do it,'' Dr. Sorensen said. In his opinion, it comes down to old and outdated assumptions that there is not much to be done for a stroke, to financial considerations and to a medical system that resists change. But the most significant barriers, he said, are financial.
Others say that while hepatitis C can be deadly, most people who are infected with it either recover spontaneously or never become ill in the first place. Most people carrying hepatitis C, they say, live normal life spans and die of something other than liver disease. ''Just because you have hepatitis C doesn't mean your life is ruined,'' said Dr. Miriam Alter, chief of the epidemiology section at the hepatitis branch of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But treatment for hepatitis C is far from ideal. Most patients must spend a year injecting themselves with the drug interferon, which both fights the virus and stimulates the immune system to attack the virus, and taking ribavirin pills, a drug that strengthens the effects of interferon. The drugs are unpleasant to take, causing flulike symptoms, including fever, lethargy, malaise, and achiness. They can also cause severe, even suicidal, depression. And they eradicate the virus in only 30 percent to 40 percent of patients. For blacks, like Mr. Woodland, the treatment rarely works, for reasons that remain unclear.
Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a professor of preventive and family medicine at the University of California in San Diego, said she has been looking for an example of a drug that prevents heart disease but does not slow its progress. ''I always ask whenever I have a group of cardiologists in the room, 'Can you give me the name of a medication that is good for the primary prevention of heart disease but not for the secondary prevention?' '' she said. ''I have not gotten an answer.'' The federal study of the 25,000 healthy women has hit a snag. In April, its directors informed the participants that there was a slight trend in the data toward more heart disease and strokes in those taking estrogen. While the trend could turn around, it does not bode well for the study, some say. Now that they know more about estrogen, researchers say, it is sounding reasonable that the hormone would not protect women's hearts after all. The hormone turns out to have many effects, some that might protect the blood vessels and the heart, others that might promote heart disease. The hormone lowers LDL cholesterol, but promotes clotting, a leading factor in heart attacks and strokes. It raises HDL cholesterol, but also raises levels of C-reactive protein, which is associated with inflammation. There is increasing evidence that inflammation contributes to heart disease.
Kirsten Moore, president of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project, an advocacy group, said she was delighted but feared that political considerations would have held more sway. ''I guess I just didn't have a lot of faith that people would let the facts speak for themselves,'' Ms. Moore said. The Bush administration is an opponent of abortion and has been more conservative on birth control than the Clinton administration, which in 2000 approved a pill that induces abortion in the early weeks of pregnancy. Opponents of the morning-after pill, including religious groups, told panel members that over-the-counter sales could encourage irresponsible sexual behavior. They also say that women may not understand how this type of pill works. While it usually acts by preventing ovulation, it also may prevent a fertilized egg from implanting. Those who believe that pregnancy begins with fertilization say the pills in doing this can induce abortions. The company that will market Plan B, Barr Laboratories, says it will provide detailed information to women on what the pills do and on how to use them. It wants to sell the drug only in stores with pharmacies but adds that it plans to advertise widely to women and doctors. The prescription now sells for $25 to $35, the company said but added that it had not decided what to charge for over-the-counter sales.
''For someone like me, it wouldn't make any difference,'' Dr. Morgan said. ''But for an elite runner, that small percentage change could mean a big deal.'' The third characteristic that elite runners have, but that can also improve with training, is an ability to continue running for long times at a high level of exertion, the so-called anerobic threshold. That pace, said Dr. David Martin, an exercise physiologist at Georgia State University, is ''when the conversation stops and the work begins.'' If you can carry on a conversation while you are running, he said, you have not reached it. For runners to increase the amount of time they can run at their anerobic threshold, they have to run at that level in training, exercise physiologists say. ''Good American runners do train at an anerobic threshold pace,'' Dr. Martin said. ''But sometimes these runners, they're little studs. They get out there running, but, they say: 'This feels so easy. I know the coach said 10 miles at anerobic threshold, but I'll just pick up the pace.' Then they are overtraining.''
But other heart disease researchers cautioned that more work was needed to prove that CRP directly causes heart disease. And most agreed that because the new studies involved only people with severe heart disease, it remained unknown whether healthy people would benefit from reducing their CRP levels. Still, the study investigators said they suspected that the results would be shown to apply more broadly. If they are correct, a huge new market for the already popular statins could be opened among people whose cholesterol levels are normal but who have high levels of CRP. Of people stricken by heart attacks, half have normal cholesterol readings. Dr. Ridker's study addressed the question of whether CRP levels independently predicted heart attacks and deaths. The second study, by Dr. Steven E. Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic and his colleagues, asked whether CRP independently predicted heart disease progression. In both cases, the investigators concluded, the answer was yes. (They, like most researchers in this field, have received support from drug companies, and Dr. Ridker is also an inventor of a test for CRP that his institution licensed. He and his laboratory profit from the use of the test.)
Two of the most rigorous studies yet completed on the relationship between cellular phones and brain tumors have found that cell-phone users are no more likely than anyone else to develop benign tumors or malignant brain cancers. One study, supported by the National Cancer Institute, was released last night, weeks ahead of its scheduled publication in The New England Journal of Medicine, to match a similar study, which was paid for by the cell-phone industry and the federal government, that is being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Scientists and public health experts said that the results should help ease the fears among many Americans that cell phones -- now estimated to be used by more than 90 million residents -- can cause brain cancer, which strikes 16,500 Americans a year. Other large studies are in progress or nearing publication, said Dr. Kenneth J. Rothman, a professor of epidemiology at the Boston University School of Public Health. But Dr. Rothman said of the new studies, ''They are the best information to date, and they provide much reassurance.''
In the meantime, another study got under way, instigated in part by Dr. Paul Thompson's curiosity about himself. Dr. Thompson, a cardiologist at Hartford Hospital in Connecticut, is a marathon runner who, despite his best efforts, has never been able to grow big muscles. He suspected a strong inherited tendency existed for muscles to respond, or not respond, to training. ''Some people get big just by walking by the barbells,'' Dr. Thompson said. ''Others can lift weights a lot and their muscles don't grow much.'' The study, with Dr. Eric Hoffman, a geneticist at the Children's National Medical Center in Washington and others, involves 700 men and 700 women who had not previously lifted weights and who agreed to train in a laboratory. They are trying to build the biceps and triceps muscles of one arm only. The other arm serves as a control while the researchers look for genetic variants that can explain their responses to training.
''I think it is really quite significant that the F.D.A. is generalizing to all products,'' Dr. Utian said. ''They recognize that you can't assume safety. If you want to say you are a safer product, you have to do the studies.''
''The saddle height that works properly is tall enough that you can't put your feet on the ground when you are sitting on the saddle,'' Mr. Schwinn said. Some clients tell him they are terrified when he sets their seats, Mr. Schwinn said, but ''once you learn how to mount and dismount, having a saddle at the proper elevation is easy.'' For serious riders, a custom bike can enhance the experience. It turns out that ready-made bicycles are best for average-size men. They are less likely to fit women, whose legs and thighs tend to be proportionately longer. Very short and very tall women have particular problems, as do men whose arms or legs are disproportionately long or short. I know those bicycle-fitting problems firsthand. With my ready-made bicycle, I had to stretch to reach the handlebars. After an hour or so of riding, I would get shooting pains in the back of my neck. And I could never sit in a way that allowed me to use my legs most efficiently when I climbed hills.
The researchers will use statistical analyses to decide how much better people fared than they would have if they had not received the screening test. Dr. Henschke said she could not conduct the study any other way. She said she had seen too many patients with tiny cancerous tumors that were removed and did not return, and too many who had no screening and whose tumors were found too late. She could not conceive of waiting well over a decade for a randomized clinical trial to enroll patients, screen them and follow them as the study wound to a close. ''How many lives will you be losing?'' Dr. Henschke said. ''If there are 160,000 people who die from lung cancer each year, you could save a lot of lives during that trial -- certainly over 100,000 from my best estimate,'' she said, calculating what she thought would be the number of lives saved over the course of the 10-year study.
The study included 1,233 people ages 50 to 79 who agreed to have a virtual colonoscopy and then, immediately afterward, a traditional one for comparison. The doctors doing the traditional colonoscopies did not know what the virtual ones had found. Each method, the investigators report, found more than 90 percent of polyps at least 8 millimeters in diameter and about 88 percent of those at least 6 millimeters across. The study, which will be published in Thursday's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, was released yesterday because it is being presented at a meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. Medical experts praised the results. ''It puts virtual colonoscopy right up there with the gold standard, optical colonoscopy,'' said Dr. J. Thomas Lamont, who is chief of gastroenterology at Beth Israel Medical School. Dr. Lamont wrote an editorial accompanying the paper. Virtual colonoscopy has been around for nearly a decade, but it has never been on the recommended list of screening tests. In previous studies it missed as many as half of even the large polyps that are most worrisome. The difference this time, said Dr. Pickhardt, is in the method.
Dr. Ronenn Roubenoff of Tufts University notes that even Jack LaLanne lost muscle as he aged. ''Muscle loss happens to everyone,'' he said. But when it comes to pushing someone into frailty, he said, the real questions are, How fast is the muscle being lost, and how much remains? ''If you stay above the trouble zone, you're O.K.,'' Dr. Roubenoff said. ''You've got that cushion.''
But Mr. Saks, the investment officer, predicted that while Uprima would have a market, it would not take over for Viagra. ''It's not a supercompetitor,'' he said. ''It's not a better drug, it's not even a me-too drug.'' But, experts say, there is no doubt that the medical world has changed. ''The major jump in legitimacy was granted by the first drug and the marketing that was very sophisticated and showed a lot of prominent figures speaking in lay terms about what the problem is,'' Dr. Hillman of Penn said. ''Thereafter, each F.D.A. decision, each H.M.O. action about coverage adds another layer of legitimacy.'' Mr. Brinkley of Pfizer said he expected that 10 years from now erectile dysfunction would be just a medical problem, of no more note than any other. Then the social process will be complete. And the markets may be saturated.
But Dr. Schatten said there was no evidence from his studies of monkeys that the differences affected the resulting infants. He said he used ICSI to create 14 monkey embryos that resulted in six pregnancies and four live offspring. One monkey was born dead but appeared anatomically normal. The other pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. With humans, said Dr. Dolores Lamb, a male infertility researcher at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, 20 percent to 40 percent of the couples who use ICSI have live babies, a rate comparable to the rate for in-vitro fertilization. But she said that couples who came to Baylor typically went home to have their babies and did not necessarily report back on how healthy the babies were. Chromosome studies cost $500, Dr. Lamb said, so no one does them. She said the safety question was ''under-studied.'' One reason, Dr. Schatten said, may be that parents do not want to identify their children as having been conceived through ICSI.
But, medical experts say, the results from the studies published today in the New England Journal of Medicine have broad implications. They demonstrate vividly that in cancer screening, finding tumors early does not necessarily mean lives will be saved. Each screening test, they say, should be rigorously evaluated, although most used today have never undergone such scrutiny. Screening, said Dr. Steven Goodman, an associate professor of oncology and pediatrics at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, is ''based on the very, very simplistic idea'' about early diagnosis: ''It might help, and how could it hurt?'' ''This is the canary in the coal mine type of example,'' Dr. Goodman said of the studies of neuroblastoma screening. ''It shows how that kind of thinking can lead to a lot of suffering.'' The studies began with high hopes. Neuroblastoma is often fatal when it is found in children after they are a year old. So when researchers in Japan developed a simple test that could find the tumors by looking for telltale chemicals in urine blotted from a diaper, many hoped that, with early diagnosis, the cancer could be eliminated through surgery.
One cause of many unnecessary doctor visits is sinus pain, Dr. Ramsey said. Most of the time it is caused by garden-variety upper respiratory viral infections, which get better on their own. Sinusitis, which may respond to antibiotics, shows up as sinus pain and an ugly bloody brown nasal discharge. If your nasal discharge is yellow or greenish, he said, you usually can wait it out. ''In most cases, when you have these symptoms, the infection will run its course,'' he explained. Other patients come in with nagging colds, worried because they do not seem to be getting better. But viral colds commonly hang on for two weeks or more, and doctors cannot do anything to make them go away any faster. Then again, doctors caution, there are some symptoms that demand attention, and are often ignored. The most cited example is indigestion that comes on with exercise and which, especially in women, can actually be a symptom of a heart attack.
TRIAL lawyers say there is a clear culprit in the obesity epidemic: a fast food industry that keeps plying Americans with calorie-laden, cheap meals and snacks. The food companies are as bad for Americans' health as the tobacco companies, they say, and the lawyers intend to litigate. A conference this weekend in Boston is examining legal approaches to fighting obesity. But there is just one problem. It was clear that persuading people not to smoke would go a long way toward getting rid of excess lung cancer and emphysema deaths and preventing huge numbers of people from suffering heart attacks and strokes. With obesity, researchers say, it is not clear what causes it or what its effects are. Are people overweight because of fast food, large portion sizes, too little activity, calorie-packed foods, constant snacking? A combination? Something else entirely? Would slimming down make overweight people any healthier? At this point, the scientific evidence is not clear.
Too simplistic, says Dr. Daniel Rader, a cholesterol researcher at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. ''Yes, high H.D.L. is generally a good thing, but it doesn't mean it is so powerful that it creates a total immunity to heart disease,'' he said. Dr. Rader and others say, for example, that there are people who have high levels of H.D.L., but the H.D.L. does not function properly. Instead of being protected from heart disease, these patients may be particularly vulnerable. A simple H.D.L. measurement does not reveal whether a person's high level is good or bad. Cholesterol researchers say that every clinic has patients with high levels of H.D.L. who ended up with heart disease. The average H.D.L. level for men is 40 to 50 milligrams per deciliter of blood and for women 50 to 60. But, even when H.D.L. levels are much higher, ''the L.D.L. can overpower the H.D.L.,'' said Dr. Christie Ballantyne of Baylor College of Medicine.
''I was finding it extremely irritating,'' Dr. Helfand said. ''We had already pretty much prepared our paper and we just needed to know when these flies were going to die. They kept living on and on. At some point, it occurred to us that maybe something is happening here that we should be paying attention to.'' By chance, the group also created a second line of flies that also lived on and on. They quickly looked to see what genes had been altered and discovered that, in both groups of flies, the same gene was slightly less efficient because a genetic fragment had interfered with its expression. ''I said, 'It can't be,' '' Dr. Helfand said. Especially when it came to a discovery this exciting, he hated to think he found it by accident. ''I would like this to be a clever screen we had set up, not just luck,'' he said.
TO determine whether these measurements can be used to predict the risk of heart disease, Dr. Lauer and his colleagues did three studies involving thousands of people, some with heart disease, others who seemed healthy. In every case, he said, the result was the same: those whose heart rates fell by less than 12 beats in the first minute after exercising had four times the risk of death over the next six years as those whose heart rates fell by more than 12 beats. Dr. Moss and his colleagues at the University of Rochester are using a more precise measurement of heart rate variability -- determining the exact interval from one heartbeat to the next by asking patients to wear portable devices that record every beat. They studied patients who had recovered from heart attacks and followed up 30 months later. Those whose heart rates had the lowest variability had a 40 percent mortality rate. For those with an intermediate level of variability, the mortality rate was 15 percent, and for those whose heart rates were the most variable, it was 10 percent.
But, Dr. Kramer said, ''we don't know of any carcinogens out there that could explain the increase in breast cancer.'' That, he said, leaves screening as an explanation. Mammography appears to find many cancers that would not otherwise have been found in a woman's lifetime. Second, mammography can find very small tumors, and that ability explains why the number of women with in situ cancers, confined to the breast ducts, and small cancers that have not spread beyond the breast has risen. But there has been little decrease in the number of women with more advanced cancers. In 1983, there were 6.1 women per 100,000 with in situ breast cancers. By 1998, there were 30.7 per 100,000. In 1983, there were 22.01 women per 100,000 with small cancers that were confined to the breast. In 1998, that number was 60.08 per 100,000. In 1983, there were 26.83 women per 100,000 with large cancers, at least two centimeters in diameter but confined to the breast, which have a worse prognosis than smaller tumors. In 1998, that number was 23.81 per 100,000.
Each month, at least one woman comes into Katterman's Sand Point  Pharmacy in Seattle to ask for a prescription drug. None of the women have seen or spoken to a doctor but each says she needs the drug immediately. The routine for a pharmacist there, Beverly Schaefer, never varies. First she ushers the woman into a private cubicle. Then she counsels them and gives them the prescription pill. The pill is an emergency contraceptive that can prevent pregnancy if it is taken within 72 hours after intercourse, and it is part of what public health officials say is a revolution that is potentially as important -- if quieter -- as the one initiated by the recent approval of the abortion-inducing pill, mifepristone, or RU-486. While mifepristone offers a way to end pregnancies, the emergency contraceptive pill can prevent them. The contraceptive pill's name is Plan B (as in, If Plan A -- the usual means of preventing pregnancy -- fails, try Plan B). Groups in several states expect to provide the pill to women who have not seen a doctor first. Washington has already done so. And Katterman's Pharmacy is one of 155 pharmacies, about 13 percent of those in the state of Washington, that are providing the pill under these circumstances. Women who want to find a pharmacy near them need only call 1 (888) not-2-late or visit the Web site not-2-late.com. The Web site from the maker of Plan B has a similarly catchy name -- GoToPlanB.com.
The women whose cancer cells indicated a good prognosis had an 85.2 percent chance of remaining free of cancer over the next decade and a 94.5 percent of surviving the decade. Those whose cancer cells indicated a poor prognosis had a 50.6 percent chance of remaining cancer-free and a 54.6 percent of surviving that time. Small tumors often had bad genetic signatures while large tumors often had good ones, throwing into question a common assumption about how cancers develop. It is often said that cancers start off unable to spread, but as they grow, they acquire this ability. ''That is based on a notion that tumors go through an evolution where they acquire more mutations as they grow bigger,'' Dr. Bernards said. ''It says that small tumors are inherently less aggressive and less malignant. But our gene expression profiling shows that that notion is too simplistic, at least for breast cancer.'' That is not to say that a small and harmless cancer can never become deadly, he added, but rather that most deadly cancers are potentially life-threatening even when they are very small.
The story of the patented H.D.L. began more than two decades ago, when Italian investigators reported that about 40 inhabitants of Limone sul Garde, a town in Northern Italy, had extraordinarily low H.D.L. levels, so low they were off the scale. Doctors expected that they would have high rates of heart disease, but, instead, it was reported, they actually seemed to be protected from heart disease and to live unusually long. ''It was one of the strangest paradoxes of medicine,'' Dr. Nissen said. Eventually, researchers discovered that these people have a mutation in their H.D.L. gene. The H.D.L. they make simply breaks down quickly. They make plenty of it, but it disappears as soon as it is used. Later, Dr. Rader says, investigators discovered that the villagers' life spans were average for the region. But, in the meantime, Pharmacia, now owned by Pfizer, had obtained the patent rights to the H.D.L. they make, known as apoA-1Milano. Esperion licensed the rights from Pharmacia, and the research began.
Dr. Nannette Wenger, a cardiologist at Emory University, said the only reason she could see for taking the hormone combination was for the temporary relief of severe symptoms of menopause. But, Dr. Wenger said, ''I would not tell anyone to start taking it.''
Some say that they have been able to rid themselves of mercury sphygmomanometers with no problems. The Mayo Clinic switched to aneroid devices and checks them annually, said Dr. Sheldon Sheps, an emeritus professor of medicine there. He said a study by the clinic's doctors looked at 248 aneroid devices, 17 percent of the 1,500 in use at two Mayo Clinic hospitals. Only one needed to be replaced. Others were less sanguine. ''Sometimes these devices give readings that are very wrong,'' Dr. Jones said, adding that the errors can be 30, 40, even 50 points. At a recent meeting, Dr. Jones described the case of an elderly woman who was receiving high doses of blood pressure lowering drugs for what looked like an alarmingly high reading. Her systolic pressure, the pressure on vessels when the heart contracts, was 170 millimeters. Normal is 120. Her pressure had been measured with an electronic device. When it was tested with a mercury sphygmomanometer, it actually was 90. In trying to lower what they thought was a dangerously high blood pressure, the woman's doctors had made her pressure so low that her brain did not get enough blood. As a result, Dr. Jones said, she had a stroke.
The new initiatives have one thing in common -- they abandoned the traditional assumption that if doctors know what works, they will provide it. Doctors do know what works, said Dr. Steven M. Asch, a health care researcher at the V.A. Greater Los Angeles Health Care System and the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica. But, he found, Americans got just half the tests and treatments they should be getting. ''Basically, it was a flip of coin, whether you got good medical care or you didn't,'' Dr. Asch said. ''It didn't matter where you lived. The shortfalls were constant.'' ''That challenged us to ask why these medical care problems were so pervasive,'' he said. At least part of the answer, he and others say, is that doctors are unaware of their shortfalls and are rewarded no matter how well they do. ''Medical care is one of those very strange parts of the economy where you get paid no matter what the quality of the service you provide,'' Dr. Asch said. ''It is like you went to a car dealership and your Mercedes is going to cost you the same as your Yugo.''
The answer, he discovered, is that champion runners had an almost freakishly efficient system to get oxygen-rich blood to the muscles and for allowing muscles to keep contracting for hours without tiring. Distance runners tend to have huge hearts and muscles that just soak up oxygen. Many of the famous distance runners he tested, like Steve Prefontaine, the legendary runner from Oregon, had hearts that were one and a half to twice the normal size, probably, Dr. Costill says, because they had a genetic gift of being able to adapt to training. Since he never studied these athletes before they became champions, he points out, it is impossible to say for sure which came first, the large heart or the running ability. ''We found some really good distance runners who didn't have big hearts, but when their hearts would contract, they would empty more fully,'' Dr. Costill said. They also had an unusual distribution of muscle fibers. Most people have about equal amounts of two types of fibers -- slow twitch fibers, which are best for endurance events like marathons, and fast twitch fibers, which are best for sprints. Distance runners have mostly slow twitch muscles in their legs, Dr. Costill found, while sprinters have mostly fast twitch muscles.
''I got sick of eating,'' he said. Even so, he and Dr. Martin, who is a professor at Georgia State University, planned his training by trial and error, Mr. Spence recalled. ''We just kind of muddled our way through,'' he said. Times have changed. Armed with new knowledge of how to survive a grueling race in heat, humidity and pollution, trainers and coaches say they are already starting to plan for two races that may be as bad as Mr. Spence's -- the World Championships in Osaka, Japan, in 2007, and the Olympics in Beijing in 2008. It is so early that the athletes for the races have not even been selected. But exercise physiologists and trainers are planning every detail, from a mile-by-mile examination of the routes to the use of a chemical that can prevent dehydration to methods for coping with the extreme air pollution in China. Each tip, each special preparation might take only 1 percent or so off a runner's time, but that can mean the difference between fame and defeat.
Now, with the cessation of this large study, many observers said, the tide may be turning. Hormone replacement therapy, once thought to be a way for women to remain forever young, protect them from heart disease and from osteoporosis, and generally leave them healthier than they would otherwise be, may be fast losing its allure. Some worry that the news will be seem so frightening that women will overreact. ''This is a bombshell,'' said Dr. Wulf Utian, executive director of the North American Menopause Society, a nonprofit group that has long advocated hormone replacement therapy for women with a clear reason for taking it, like hot flashes or bone loss. ''I think there is a real danger of panicking literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of women.'' Dr. Utian added that he advised women to discuss the findings with their doctors before deciding to throw away their hormones. Dr. Suzanne Fletcher, who is professor of ambulatory care and preventive medicine at Harvard Medical School, also emphasized that there was no reason to panic.
Not all cancers will spread and kill, and sometimes the outcome is the same whether a cancer is found earlier or later. But with screening, doctors treat any tumors they find because they cannot tell which are worrisome and which are not. In the end, screening, far from preventing cancer, actually leads to more cancer patients, Dr. Kramer noted, by finding both those whose cancers would have been deadly and those whose cancers would never have been a problem because they would have remained small and never spread, or would even have disappeared. ''People often talk about mammograms to prevent breast cancer when what it's done is to increase, not decrease, the incidence of breast cancer,'' Dr. Kramer said. Many people decide to take their chances with screening, reasoning that they would rather be treated for a cancer that would not have killed them than to miss being treated for a cancer that could be lethal. But it is not easy to know if screening helps or harms over all, Dr. Kramer said, adding that it requires large controlled trials. Such studies, he noted, have not yet been completed for some popular tests, like the P.S.A. test for prostate cancer and spiral CT tests for lung cancer.
But, he said, scientific journals like positive results, rejecting papers whose data fail to support a hypothesis. ''These kinds of negative results are often very hard to get into publications,'' Dr. Olsen said. But according to Dr. Scott Kern, a professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the journals aren't entirely to blame. Some negative data are not published, he suggests, because those conducting the studies do not want to share them. Dr. Kern should know. He started his own electronic journal of negative results, called NOGO, which stands for Negative Observations in Genetic Oncology, with high hopes that cancer researchers would publish there. He focused on gene mutations that might predispose to cancer, looking for studies showing that a mutation is not associated with a cancer rather than ones showing it is. All he asked was that scientists fill out a form and post it on NOGO's Web site, letting others know not to waste their time.
Dr. Woolf said the group was aware of the data from the Canadian study that failed to find benefits from screening women in their 40's, but that did not change its conclusion that mammography's benefits start at 40. The group, he explained, considered the totality of the evidence. But Dr. Cornelia Baines of the University of Toronto, a principal investigator for the Canadian study, said she thought that the question of mammography for women in their 40's should be settled by her group's extensive data. ''After 13 years, the number of deaths was the same in the group that had mammograms and the group that had normal medical care,'' she said. In addition, she said, mammography was finding some cancers that would never have been detected and never have caused any problem if the women had not been screened. But once found, as would be expected and is appropriate, they were treated.
The difference does not involve changes in genes, as far as is known, but changes in the human form. It shows up in several ways, from those that are well known and almost taken for granted, like greater heights and longer lives, to ones that are emerging only from comparisons of health records. The biggest surprise emerging from the new studies is that many chronic ailments like heart disease, lung disease and arthritis are occurring an average of 10 to 25 years later than they used to. There is also less disability among older people today, according to a federal study that directly measures it. And that is not just because medical treatments like cataract surgery keep people functioning. Human bodies are simply not breaking down the way they did before. Even the human mind seems improved. The average I.Q. has been increasing for decades, and at least one study found that a person's chances of having dementia in old age appeared to have fallen in recent years.
In animal work so far only about 1 to 5 percent of cloning attempts succeed, said Dr. Randall Prather, a cloning expert at the University of Missouri. That is, for every 100 eggs, one to five clones are born. Most attempts fail early on, when the embryo first starts to develop. But many die as fetuses, and even after birth, things can go awry. Some of cloned animals have died in infancy or soon afterward with serious medical problems, like defects in their lungs or immune systems. Scientists suspect that the problem is that the egg is trying to reprogram the adult cell's genetic material so quickly that errors can creep in, making some genes turn on too late in development, others too early and others not at all. Some animals have defied attempts at cloning and many cloning efforts took years, and thousands of attempts, before they succeeded. When they did succeed, it was not always clear why. Nor was it clear which animals would be easier to clone and which harder.
Estrogen can ease hot flashes and night sweats in women going through or who have passed through menopause, and it can stem the bone loss that accelerates with menopause. But, the group said, it remains to be established whether it protects against heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, broken bones from osteoporosis, severe depression and urinary incontinence, theories that observational studies suggested. Committee members said they were absolutely convinced that they were right to voice their skepticism, given that so many women are taking hormone therapy in the belief that it has been proved to be helpful. ''It is mind boggling to give 20 million American women a drug with major side effects without definitive proof that it works,'' said Dr. Deborah Grady, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California in San Francisco. Others say they are deeply troubled and puzzled. They note that observational studies are hardly trivial research and that they are in any event the only way scientists can ethically address questions questions like whether day care affects children's development, whether watching violence on television leads to criminal behavior or whether environmental or occupational exposure to chemicals like benzene, arsenic, asbestos and lead is dangerous.
The findings should also give doctors pause in prescribing treatments they know are useless, like  a glass of warm milk at bedtime for patients with insomnia or futile drugs for patients in the late stages of fatal diseases, Dr. Bailar said. ''I think what this ought to do is bring about a very sharp reduction in the use of placebos,'' he said. ''My guess is that it will bring about a modest reduction and that it will take a second or third penetrating paper to bring about a real change.'' But, Dr. Bailar said, he understands the reluctance many will feel to abandon their belief in placebos. He, too, is hesitant to  wrench himself completely away from what he now thinks is largely a myth. ''I'm not ready to give up on placebos entirely,'' Dr. Bailar said. ''I hope there will be a lot more research on how they work.''
The answer, the researchers found, appeared to be yes. But the studies involved patients with severe heart disease, not healthy people or people at risk for heart disease. Studies are now under way in healthy people, but, in the meantime, cardiologists are divided about whether it is helpful to measure CRP in most patients and what to do when the level is high. Some cardiologists -- including Mr. Newton's, Dr. Christopher Cannon of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston -- say nearly all patients can benefit from knowing their CRP. If it is high, he said, that can motivate patients to take measures to reduce their risk of heart disease. (Dr. Cannon, an author of one of the new reports on CRP, receives honorariums and research financing from a variety of companies making drugs for heart disease, and he serves on advisory boards for 10 companies.) The levels of the protein, which is made in the liver and in cells lining blood vessels, rise with things that make heart disease more likely, like smoking, obesity, high cholesterol and diabetes. They fall when patients stop smoking, lose weight and get their cholesterol and diabetes under control.
The emphysema operation, lung volume reduction surgery, sneaked up on Medicare about a decade ago. Medicare never agreed to pay for the procedure. But unbeknownst to the agency, pay it did. ''None of the contractors in the Medicare system was aware that the operation was becoming more popular until it began being reported in journals,'' Dr. Tunis said. In 1996, Medicare learned that it had paid for 3,000 patients and the numbers were growing fast. But there was a 17 percent mortality rate and no good evidence that the operation worked. In response, the federal government started a clinical trial involving 1,218 patients. Medicare would pay for the operation only if patients participated in the trial, and if they joined the trial there was a 50 percent chance that they would be assigned to a control group that did not get the operation. Dr. Tunis says the outcome of the trial will determine whether Medicare will cover the operation. But Dr. Ramsey, the University of Washington health economist, said the agency never stopped to consider ''what would happen if the trial came out with uncertain results.''
Dr. Henschke wondered whether advances in technology might have changed the prospects for lung cancer screening. A new generation of X-ray machines, the spiral CT, or computerized tomography, scanners, could show nodules as small as the diameter of a soda straw, compared with the the quarter-size tumors that were seen with chest X-rays. Could it be, Dr. Henschke asked, that the spiral scanners, already widely used by radiologists,  could find lung cancers so early that they could be cured? That was in 1991. ''No one was willing to talk about it,'' Dr. Henschke said. ''They said it's a dead issue.'' Despite the skeptics, Dr. Henschke organized a study of 1,000 smokers and former smokers, examining each person's lungs with both spiral CT scans and with conventional chest X-rays and comparing what the two machines found. When the radiologists saw very small nodules, they asked the patients to come back  in a few months to see if the nodules were growing. If a nodule grew, patients needed more tests, sometimes involving surgery, to see if it was cancerous.
His main concern, he said, is that companies will promise too much too soon, turning the public bitter and cynical. ''Then a whiplash occurs and you end up curtailing progress,'' Dr. Kaback said. Dr. Roses noted that the pharmacogenetics approach might not provide people with information about disease susceptibility or their medical futures. While a genetic variant may make a difference in whether a person with asthma, for example, responds to albuterol, it does not have any bearing on whether that person will get asthma in the first place. The genetic variant is predicting individual physiological responses to drug molecules, not the biochemical processes that caused the disease being treated. And when SNP patterns are analyzed together, as a sort of DNA bar code, they will predict drug responses without revealing anything about the actual genes on which the SNP's occur. Bartha Maria Knoppers, a law professor at the University of Montreal, who is chairwoman of the international ethics committee of the Human Genome Organization, an international organization of scientists who are working on finding the sequence of the human genome, said she thinks that the benefits of the new approach are overwhelming.
''When I first started taking care of patients 20 years ago,'' Dr. Stevenson said, ''we did not see patients who would be suffering for months and months before death.'' Now, she said, many patients find themselves agonizing over whether to have defibrillators turned off. Dr. Stevenson emphasized that turning off a defibrillator was not like turning off a ventilator. ''It is not an immediate end,'' she said. Sometimes a patient lives for months. She advocates discussing the issues with patients while they are relatively healthy and before they have the defibrillators implanted. ''We have to talk to people about preventing death, designing our mode of death, when to intervene to change when we die,'' she said. Other cardiologists said they were not inclined to discuss end-of-life issues with people who might have years of good life ahead of them. Dr. Saxon, of San Francisco, said: ''I focus on how we're going to get you better and improve things for you and your family. I can't deny you something because five years down the road it might not be the best thing for you. I'll deal with the five-year thing when it comes up.
It is lunchtime, and the door to Boca Urology's office is locked. But outside, patients are milling about, calling the office on their cellphones, hoping the receptionist will let them in. To say they are eager hardly does them justice. ''We never used to lock the door at lunch, but they came in an hour early,'' said Ellie Fertel, the office manager. ''It's like they're waiting for a concert. Sometimes we forget to lock the door and they come in and sit in the dark.'' Yet few have serious medical problems, let alone emergencies. ''It's the culture,'' said Dr. Jeffrey I. Miller, one of four urologists in the practice. Doctor visits have become a social activity in this place of palm trees and gated retirement communities. Many patients have 8, 10 or 12 specialists and visit one or more of them most days of the week. They bring their spouses and plan their days around their appointments, going out to eat or shopping while they are in the area. They know what they want; they choose specialists for every body part. And every visit, every procedure is covered by Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly.
Scientists will say they knew it all along. If these truths were so evident, there would be no need to do large studies in which people were randomly assigned to take estrogen or, for comparison, to take a dummy pill. There would be no need to do similar studies with high-fiber diets. In fact, such studies would be unethical because they would deprive the control groups of a valuable preventative measure. The same goes for other questions now being investigated: does examining the colon with sigmoidoscopy screening prevent colon cancer deaths? Does the P.S.A. test and a digital rectal exam for prostate cancer save lives? Does a high-fiber diet prevent heart disease? Maybe the problem is one of language. Scientists and the public alike use words like ''prevents'' and ''protects against'' and ''lowers the risk of'' when they are discussing evidence that is suggestive, and hypothesis-generating, as well as when they are discussing evidence that is as firm as science can make it.
In an interview last week, Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, the director of the National Cancer Institute, said he did not favor the proposed study because he was concerned that testosterone could spur the growth of prostate cancer among some men in the study. ''I am not disagreeing that there are men out there who would desperately like to take testosterone,'' Dr. von Eschenbach said. But he said more research was needed to make sure any drug formula tested in a clinical trial would ''minimize the likelihood of a deleterious effect.'' Dr. Cunningham and Dr. Matsumoto got the news on June 27 in a conference call with administrators from the National Institutes of Health and the V.A. Their proposed clinical trial, they learned, would not take place. ''We were all upset,'' Dr. Matsumoto said. The trial, he said, ''is essentially dead at this point.'' Dr. Hodis of the National Institute on Aging said he was determined to keep looking for a way to design a safe trial and was planning a major conference to discuss the matter.
The Quebec study, directed by Dr. William G. Woods of the Aflac Cancer Center in Atlanta and his colleagues, including Dr. Bernard Lemieux of the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec and Dr. Mendel Tuchman of the Children's National Medical Center in Washington, involved virtually every child born in Quebec from 1989 through 1994, a total of 476,654 babies. When the children were 3 weeks old and 6 months old, the investigators offered the screening test. The test did find children with neuroblastomas, and the cancer's incidence doubled in Quebec, compared with the areas used as controls, Ontario, Minnesota, Florida and the Greater Delaware Valley. The problem was that the death rate from neuroblastoma in Quebec did not budge. Nine years later, Dr. Woods said, the conclusion was inescapable: The test, apparently, was not finding the dangerous cancers and instead was finding cancers that, researchers later learned, would stop growing and revert to normal if they were left alone. Yet the two kinds of cancer looked exactly alike in laboratory tests.
''It strikes me as inescapable, given these results, that there are other things at work as well,'' he said. One possibility, he and others suggested, is that more intensive therapy has a greater effect in suppressing inflammation. When plaque is inflamed, it is more likely to burst open. The study does not mean that doctors should abandon Pravachol, Dr. Bodnar said. While statins are considered very safe, and no patients in the study suffered serious or permanent harm, the Lipitor patients had more side effects. Liver enzymes were elevated in 3.3 percent of them, as against 1.1 percent of Pravachol patients. When that happens, patients may have to reduce the dose of the drug or stop taking it. In all, 3.3 percent of Lipitor patients, compared with 2.7 percent of Pravachol patients, stopped taking their medication because of enzyme elevation or an unrelated side effect, muscle aches. A number of cardiologists said the study's results applied to everyone at high risk, and some experts said they might apply to everyone whose cholesterol levels are elevated.
Administrators at Medicare are well aware of the problem, Dr. Jencks said. ''We've reached a conclusion,'' he said. ''We have to change the system.'' Dr. Jencks said he expected that in the future hospitals and doctors would be paid according to whether they gave patients treatments that worked. ''It is very clear that we are moving toward pay-for-performance,'' he said. Change, though, will require fundamental alterations in how hospitals and doctors' offices operate, health care researchers say. And it is not so easy to change a medical system, as Hackensack University Medical Center discovered. ''We tried to come up with a standardized order set,'' with all the measures that Medicare was asking about, Dr. Gross said. ''But the doctors didn't want to use the sheet,'' insisting they would just remember those items. Then they forgot. The solution, Dr. Gross said, was to assign specially trained nurses to see what care was provided and remind doctors when important steps were omitted. The result was immediate improvement, Dr. Gross said, even in items not on Medicare's list.
The problem, as with other cancer scans, is that science cannot always tell the difference between cancers that will stop and those that will not. The researchers also ask another question: How often did the scans find cancers early but without affecting the person's life expectancy? ''Everyone knows we can pick up things better with screening,'' said Dr. Elliott Fishman, a professor of radiology and oncology at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. ''But is picking up the same thing as curing? If I pick up a tumor that is one centimeter today and you live five years or I pick it up four years later and you live one year, it's the same thing.'' Even evaluating patients with suspicious CT results can be risky, more dangerous, say, than evaluating women with suspicious lumps on a mammogram, said Dr. David Johnson, deputy director of the cancer center at Vanderbilt University and a past president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
Dr. Antman suggests that heart disease patients ask their doctor if there is a hospital nearby that does angioplasty around the clock. If so, they might want to discuss with their doctor whether to ask that an ambulance take them there if they are having a heart attack. It is the sort of advice that makes cardiologists nervous -- they do not want to encourage patients to dictate treatment. But, Dr. Antman said, if it is feasible to get to an angioplasty-providing hospital within an hour, ''in most cases that would be preferable.'' Getting the Proper Therapy Opening an artery is only the start of treatment. The next part is at least as problematic: Patients have to get the right drugs, in the right doses, and have to take them for the rest of their lives. ''Care is getting a lot better,'' Dr. Peterson said. ''But the only caveat is that they are only really looking at, Did you get therapy? No one is looking too closely at, Did you do it right?''
With great difficulty, Dr. Fite twisted her body and grasped her cellphone. ''I called 911, but nothing would come out of my mouth,'' she said. Then she found that if she spoke very slowly, she could get out words. So, she recalled, ''I said 'stroke' in this long, horrible voice.'' Dr. Fite is one of an estimated 700,000 Americans who had a stroke last year, but one of the very few who ended up at a hospital with the equipment and expertise to accurately diagnose and treat it. Stroke is the third-leading cause of death in this country, behind heart disease and cancer, killing 150,000 Americans a year, leaving many more permanently disabled, and costing the nation $62.7 billion in direct and indirect costs, according to the American Stroke Association. But from diagnosis to treatment to rehabilitation to preventing it altogether, a stroke is a litany of missed opportunities. Many patients with stroke symptoms are examined by emergency room doctors who are uncomfortable deciding whether the patient is really having a stroke -- a blockage or rupture of a blood vessel in the brain that injures or kills brain cells -- or is suffering from another condition. Doctors are therefore reluctant to give the only drug shown to make a real difference, tPA, or tissue plasminogen activator.
It depends on cigarette smoking, it depends on obesity, it depends on certain environmental conditions.  Q.  So if more medical care does not make us healthier, what should we do to improve our health?  A.  Improved health will come about through changes in the physical and psychosocial environments and in individual behavior and in medical advances, not in increasing the quantity of medical care at a given point in time. A CONVERSATION WITH: VICTOR FUCHS
Now Dr. Moss is leading a national study that is recruiting 1,200 heart patients to see whether having an automatic defibrillator implanted in the chest can save lives. A secondary goal is to determine if heart rate variability can identify those who will benefit most from the devices. Defibrillators, about half the size of a package of cigarettes, are placed beneath the skin and are signaled by a wire that is placed directly in the heart. When the defibrillator senses that the heart is starting to beat erratically -- a condition that can lead to death from totally uncoordinated attempts at a heartbeat -- it administers an electric shock to bring its rhythm back. But the devices are expensive -- to have one implanted, Dr. Moss said, costs about $25,000 -- so there is a strong need to know who will benefit from them. His hypothesis is that patients whose heart rates are the steadiest are most likely to be helped by a defibrillator. Until the study is completed, however, he cannot say if his hypothesis is correct.
They are also sold without a doctor's guidance. ''Everything you've ever heard of is being marketed,'' said Dr. Wulf Utian, the executive director of the North American Menopause Society, ''and it's being marketed to a confused and vulnerable population.'' Prempro, a combination of estrogens and progestin made by Wyeth, has long dominated the menopause market. Until this summer it was used by six million American women, many of whom assumed they would be taking it for a lifetime to protect against some effects of aging, like brittle bones. But when the federal study, the Women's Health Initiative, found that Prempro carried slight risks (of heart attack, stroke and breast cancer) that outweighed its benefits (a slightly lower risk of colon cancer and hip fracture), the part of the study in which women were taking Prempro was ended. A study in which women take estrogen alone continues. A Wyeth spokesman, Doug Petkus, said sales of Prempro had declined 25 to 30 percent.
Few scientists questioned this view, Dr. Brooks said. But, he said, he became interested in it in the 1960's, when he was running track at Queens College and his coach told him that his performance was limited by a buildup of lactic acid. When he graduated and began working on a Ph.D. in exercise physiology, he decided to study the lactic acid hypothesis for his dissertation. ''I gave rats radioactive lactic acid, and I found that they burned it faster than anything else I could give them,'' Dr. Brooks said. It looked as if lactic acid was there for a reason. It was a source of energy. Dr. Brooks said he published the finding in the late 70's. Other researchers challenged him at meetings and in print. ''I had huge fights, I had terrible trouble getting my grants funded, I had my papers rejected,'' Dr. Brooks recalled. But he soldiered on, conducting more elaborate studies with rats and, years later, moving on to humans. Every time, with every study, his results were consistent with his radical idea.
Dr. Stuart Schnider, who runs abortion clinics in Raleigh and Charlotte, N.C., said that he had provided women with methotrexate, a drug developed for cancer patients that can induce an abortion. Doctors are allowed to prescribe drugs for other uses once the drugs are on the market. Dr. Schnider said he knew about the fetal remains law and worried about it. ''We asked them to bring back whatever remains are passed,'' Dr. Schnider said. And did the women comply? ''Of course not,'' he said. Ms. Jones said that doctors in North Carolina who do not collect and examine fetal remains faced a risk of criminal prosecution. Several states require that abortion providers be licensed and that their facilities meet requirements that also apply to surgical suites -- even if they are doing pill-induced abortions. Dr. Schnider explained that all abortion providers in North Carolina must register and their facilities  must be open to state inspections.
Students may have no idea that they are heading for such a dispute -- and this is one reason why Dr. Zigmond likes to present students with a case history that can end up that way. He and others teaching ethics course rely on stories they collect from their own experiences and those of other researchers. This case involves a woman who has just finished her Ph.D. and has gotten a job. She is packing up her things to go, when her adviser tells her that she can't take her lab notebooks; they belong to the lab and, by the way, he has already assigned another student to continue with some of the experiments she had started. What should she do? Go off without the notebooks, sneak in over the weekend and copy them? Most students think there is nothing to discuss. Some say she should take the data; most say she should not.
Ms. Todd was tested and told that her antibodies were preventing her from having a baby. Dr. Sher said treatments with intravenous immunoglobulins, or IVIG, made from the pooled serum of blood donors, could help. Most fertility experts, and the American Society for Assisted Reproduction, regard the antibody tests as unproved and the IVIG treatments as dangerous, because they can elicit severe allergic reactions. Dr. Mary Stephenson, an expert on recurrent pregnancy loss at the University of Chicago, said that even the idea behind the approach was wrong, that there was no connection between women who fail to become pregnant and women who miscarry. Ms. Todd, aware of the dispute, struggled with the conflicting opinions. ''Everyone I spoke to was either passionately for it or passionately against it,'' she said. The only randomized controlled study of IVIG was done by Dr. Stephenson in 51 infertile women. ''It wasn't a huge study but it was the only randomized trial there is,'' she said. The result? ''It showed no difference.''
The wiggling and writhing movements first emerged a year after the operation, showing up in five of the younger patients who had at first appeared to benefit from fetal cell surgery -- three who had the operation in the initial phase of the study and two who had it a year later, when they learned that they had originally had a sham surgery. While doctors sometimes see such effects in Parkinson's patients, it is caused by giving too much of drugs that act like dopamine in the brain. And it can be controlled by reducing the drugs. In this case, however, drugs were not the culprit. Even when doctors took away the drugs, the symptoms persisted. The fetal implant study had been controversial from the start, both because it included sham surgery and because it used fetal tissue from abortions. But many Parkinson's disease experts said it had to be done because doctors were already offering the surgery to patients, and charging them for it, at costs of $40,000 or more, with no evidence that they were helping them. Yet patients, facing a disease in which brain cells slowly and inexorably die and in which even the drugs that once controlled their symptoms of tremor and rigidity would inevitably fail, took their chances with the operation, thinking they had little to lose.
WHEN it came to his health, Jim Wenzell had to admit, he was a typical man. A pilot for Southwest Airlines, he started having trouble dragging his luggage across airports. ''I'd get short of breath, have a little pain in my chest,'' he said. Mr. Wenzell, who is 51, thought he knew what the problem was: ''I thought I was out of shape.'' He had his annual physical exam -- required by the airline -- and found out otherwise. His problem was two almost completely blocked coronary arteries. It was quite a surprise. He had no family history of heart disease, he said, and no risk factors. Well, maybe one. His cholesterol level, when last tested a decade ago, had been an alarmingly high 275, 75 points above the safe level. He thought he had taken care of it with a crash low-fat diet. But eventually he returned to his old ways, eating whatever he wanted, and never had his cholesterol rechecked. When he recently learned that his arteries were blocked, his doctor informed him that his cholesterol had soared to 290.
''By the time we see a tumor, it could be five years after the cancer started and hundreds of cell divisions later,'' Dr. Goodman said. ''What this leaves open is, If you saw them yet earlier, would you pick up tumors with less metastatic potential or would you pick up those with metastatic potential before they metastasize?'' Dr. Goodman said it would be premature to say that the very concept of mammography was flawed. Instead, he said, he expected that genetic signatures would eventually show that the fraction of tumors that can be cured if they are found by mammography, but not later, is small. ''I think it will show us that the window of opportunity only exists in a small number of women,'' Dr. Goodman said. ''This will explain why mammography has such a limited effect and may ultimately show it has no effect.'' For now, however, the genetic signature studies are not ready to provide such definitive answers.
In the last gulf war, Dr. Winkenwerder said, ''we just sent teams forward to vaccinate.'' ''There was not good record keeping,'' he added, ''and different people got different amounts of shots.'' Many worried about what they had received and whether they had been given experimental vaccines or drugs that might have made them ill. In addition, the Veterans Affairs and Defense Departments are working together for the first time to compile data, Mr. Principi said. The agencies will have blood samples from the troops before and after deployment that will allow researchers to search for exposure to toxins. Details on troop locations and potentially dangerous substances encountered will also be available. Medics and doctors in the gulf are also carrying personal digital assistants to collect information on every medical complaint or illness. The data will be useful if any of the troops report symptoms later. But the data could also be crucial in surveillance for biological or chemical attacks.
Last Wednesday, a California teenager died at a hospital in Pleasanton, just days after taking prescription pills to abort her early pregnancy. The circumstances surrounding her death are unclear, and an autopsy is under way. But battle lines are already being drawn, with opponents of abortion saying the death of the woman, Holly Patterson, 18, shows why the abortion pills are too dangerous to remain on the market, while abortion providers say it shows no such thing. ''We're sorry to say that this is what we warned would happen,'' said Wendy Wright, senior policy director at Concerned Women of America, which opposes abortions. ''This drug needs to be taken off the market.'' Ron Fitzsimmons, executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, said that it was not clear why Ms. Patterson died, but that Ms. Wright's reaction was no surprise. ''We expect the antis to jump all over it,'' he said.
The obesity association said that it planned to use Medicare as a wedge to open the door for broader coverage for the obese and then, possibly, for overweight Americans. Obesity, said Morgan Downey, the association's executive director, is a disease, and should be treated. Insurers pay for treating other chronic diseases, he added, although ''there are very, very few cures out there.'' Doctors, of course, have been telling patients for years that weight loss will greatly improve their health. But, in fact, there is only one long-term study following obese people who deliberately lost weight -- in this case, with weight loss surgery -- and comparing their health with those of similar people who did not lose weight. The results were a surprise. The study of 692 patients by Dr. C. David Sjostrom of Goteborg University in Sweden, found, as expected, that the surgical patients lost weight -- 68 pounds in the first year and 44 pounds after eight years.
In the 1950's, doctors were bitterly divided about an issue that seems eerily modern. What, they asked, is the point of finding breast cancer early? On one side were the surgeons who passionately argued that small tumors were the ones that could be cured. As cancers grow, surgeons said, they develop an ability to spread and kill. So the best way to stop cancer is to find it as soon as possible, cut it out and blast the area with X-rays, as chemotherapy was not yet being used for breast cancer. Finding it early, in those days before mammography, meant breast self-exams and examinations of the breasts by physicians. On the other side was a group of doctors who became known as the biological predeterminists. They said that early detection was being oversold, and that it was much less helpful than the surgeons said. All too often, they said, a tumor will be deadly, despite its early detection, and treatment will be futile. Or it will be harmless -- even if it grows very large it will never spread beyond the breast and kill. Such tumors would need no treatment. Surgeons who asserted that they cured cancers by removing the tumors early were usually deceiving themselves -- many women who seemed cured were never at risk and many who were at risk were never cured.
For example, the data Hoffmann-La Roche presented to the F.D.A. last year, pooled from several studies, including the current one and looking at 7,000 people, showed that 10 women taking orlistat developed breast cancer but that just one taking placebos got the disease. The company argued that there was no biological reason why orlistat would cause breast cancer, but the F.D.A. asked for a detailed analysis of the question. That analysis, Dr. Hauptman said, was provided in the company's response to the F.D.A. yesterday. He said it showed that for some women the breast cancer was diagnosed within six months of starting to take orlistat -- too soon for the drug to have caused the cancers. Other women already had evidence of breast cancer on mammograms when they entered the study. The company's analysis, Dr. Hauptman said, ''supports our conclusion that there is no increased risk.'' In the study published today, the women who took orlistat had the same incidence of breast cancer as those who took a placebo.
Dr. Richardson said she mostly gives antidepressants or Neurontin to breast cancer patients who have severe symptoms of menopause and are willing to take a chance that the drugs might be safe over the long term. But these are desperate women, she said. ''When you are waking up four times a night soaking wet, you'll take anything.'' ''It is very important for women to understand that there isn't a right answer,'' Dr. Richardson said. Some doctors are finding there are so many answers that each woman who comes into their office will leave with different advice. That happened to Dr. Utian of the North American Menopause Society on Wednesday, the day after the Women's Health Initiative study came to a halt. He saw 10 women who were going through or had gone through menopause. Each wanted to discuss the question: Should she take hormones? Each left his office with a different recommendation.
When she finished a second draft, Ms. Goodman showed the manuscript to Tom Schwarz, a researcher at Children's Hospital in Boston. Friends with Dr. Schwarz's wife, Ms. Goodman wanted his opinion: was the science right? Dr. Schwarz said he began to read the book and could not believe it. Ms. Goodman had not interviewed him, and she had not been to his lab. But, Dr. Schwarz said, ''I saw myself and I saw things I knew, everything from the greasy falafels from the truck parked outside to the characters.'' He recalled a scene in which a young postdoc, Cliff, on the verge of being dismissed from the lab, suddenly has astonishing results. He presents them to his colleagues at a lab meeting. ''The researchers were all staring: intent, admiring, jealous,'' Ms. Goodman wrote. ''These were Cliff's siblings. They had been his peers here at the wood-grain table, they'd drunk bad coffee with him at these meetings.''
Veterans not involved in Operation Ranch Hand showed the same trend, said Dr. Joel E. Michalek, an Air Force statistician who is the principal investigator for the study. Many people have some dioxin in their blood because it was once widely used as a herbicide, so people were exposed to it in the environment, and it persists in body fat. Dr. Michalek said in a telephone interview that the two groups of Air Force veterans might have shown no difference in their diabetes incidence, over all, because many men in the Ranch Hand group did not have high dioxin levels. About half of the Ranch Hand group, he said, had average levels of the defoliant in their blood. So even if dioxin exposure did increase diabetes risk, the effect might not have been apparent. For that reason, he said, his group moved on to advanced statistical modeling and data analyses.
The other study, by Dr. Umberto Veronesi of the European Institute of Oncology and his colleagues, involved women with tumors no larger than two centimeters in diameter, though in all but three cases the tumors were large enough to feel. Once again, more extensive surgery was no more effective than surgery that conserved the woman's breast. Some medical experts say the new findings will fuel the debate over whether women with newly diagnosed breast cancer should have ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging tests, which can detect minute flecks of cancer in the breast. Such cell clusters occur in 16 percent to 37 percent of women with breast cancer, and doctors often advise them to have a mastectomy, since a lumpectomy cannot remove those clusters. But Dr. Morrow and other experts said the two studies indicated that it made no difference whether tiny clusters of cancer cells were removed along with the breast in a mastectomy or were left behind when a woman had a lumpectomy.
''If someone walks into my office with a court order or if they put a gun to my head they still could not read my conversations,'' Dr. Lipton said. In a sense, say some mathematicians and computer scientists, Dr. Rabin may have solved the ultimate problem in cryptography, one that has driven research for centuries: finding a provably unbreakable code that is also practical. But, they say, the paradox is that the discovery has come at a time of vigorous debate over whether such a code will make much difference in keeping communications private. Some say that a provably unbreakable code could have profound effects, keeping secret messages secret forever. But others say that codes today are already so good that there is little to be gained by making them provably, rather than just probably, unbreakable. For now, Dr. Rabin's idea is simply a scheme backed up by a mathematical proof that he has been presenting to scientists at seminars. No company is lurking in the background to sell it, and Dr. Rabin says he has no commercial interests in it.
''I can tell you that every woman who comes into a Planned Parenthood affiliate for a medical abortion is counseled extensively about the procedure,'' said Dr. Vanessa Cullins, a Planned Parenthood official. Some accounts say Ms. Patterson had severe pain and bleeding on Sept. 14, went to a hospital and was sent home with painkillers. She was back on Sept. 16, dying the next day. ''She didn't have someone to care for her who recognized the danger she was in,'' said Dr. Donna Harrison, an obstetrician-gynecologist in Berrien Springs, Mich. Dr. Harrison is author of a petition by the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists asking that the drug be pulled from the market. ''That is the crux of our complaint,'' Dr. Harrison said. ''Mifeprex,'' she said, referring to the drug's brand name, ''has effectiveness. It does work.'' But, she continued, ''this is a dangerous drug that is essentially unregulated, which makes it more dangerous.''
Dr. James F. Battey, director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders and chairman of the National Institute of Health's stem cell task force, said scientists were free to study other stem cell lines if they used private money. He understands the researchers' complaints that it would be better if the government paid for work on more lines, but, he said, as far as the federal government is concerned, ''the argument isn't solely about science.'' ''What the president has already said on multiple occasions is that he is committed to the notion that taxpayers' money should not be used to encourage the destruction of human embryos,'' Dr. Battey said. ''This is a White House policy.'' And, he said, ''it is not based solely on the needs of the scientific community.'' But Dr. Zon said being able to work on more human stem cell lines could help the research.
Some experts cautioned that the findings were relatively weak and that in any case they were correlations, which do not prove a cause and effect relationship. But others said they were important because this was the first long-term study to link violent behavior and television watching by teenagers and young adults. The research is also different in that it found a link between violence and viewing of any television programming, not just violent programming. Dr. Johnson said the data came from a study he and his colleagues had been conducting for another purpose, a study on how mental health is affected by adversity in childhood, like parental neglect, low income and stressful life events. The study, which is continuing, began when the children were 1 to 10 years old. Over the years, the families in the study had been questioned about their television viewing, and there have been several assessments of the children's violent behavior. Families had been interviewed and a random selection of young people had filled out detailed questionnaires that asked about violent behavior. In addition, the scientists had reports on the children's aggressive behavior and criminal acts.
The Nurses' Health Study was what scientists call observational. Tens of thousands of nurses reported on their hormone use and their health. Researchers found that hormone users had 30 percent fewer heart attacks. By contrast, the Women's Health Initiative was the sort of study that is considered a gold standard -- thousands of women were randomly assigned to take the most widely used hormone preparation, Prempro, made by Wyeth, or a placebo, and their health was monitored. Women who took hormones had 40 percent more heart attacks. Ordinarily, a randomized placebo-controlled study like this trumps an observational study; that is what happened here. Within weeks, many doctors who had recommended hormone therapy changed their advice. Prempro sales plummeted. But that is not the end of the story, for the Nurses' Health Study is no ordinary observational study. Its participants are nurses, presumably better able than most people to report reliably on the drugs they take, exercise habits, diets, and so on. So its conclusions are hard to dismiss and, in fact, they have often helped shape public health policy on a number of issues.
''We said, 'This is really startling, that there are so many people who are communicating without people knowing that they are communicating.' And because these programs were coming from around the world, we were very concerned.'' Mr. Hosmer's company began looking at millions of digital pictures that were posted on the Internet. They scanned auction sites and pornographic sites, where people can  post and download digital images anonymously. ''We started getting hits,'' Mr. Hosmer said, adding that about 0.6 percent of millions of pictures on auction and pornography sites had hidden messages. The messages they found on eBay were encrypted and unreadable, he said. The company also noticed that some of the same photos seemed to be used over and over again, with different messages each time. ''If you're very sophisticated at this, you would never use an image again,'' Mr. Hosmer said. One limitation in published steganography detection programs is that often they miss images hidden in the most frequently used format, JPEG, said Dr. Jessica Fridrich, a research professor at the Center for Intelligent Systems at the State University of New York at Binghamton.
Another way to open a blocked artery is to thread a tiny balloon into the blood vessel and inflate it, pushing the blockage against the artery wall, and then holding the artery open with a stent, a tiny metal cage. But not every blockage can be opened with a balloon, and the method can be less effective than bypass surgery. Heart surgeons have spent a decade trying to make bypass surgery less injurious. A few began doing simple cases without heart-lung machines, operating on beating hearts. By pushing down on a part of the heart to hold it steady, doctors can sometimes sew a blood vessel onto a heart that is still beating. At the same time, doctors had another idea. Why not punch small holes into the chest and insert instruments that are attached to long sticks? They could operate without making large incisions and breaking patients' ribs. But the task proved daunting. This sort of microsurgery, which had proved so successful in other operations, was not working in the heart, where precise and delicate movements were impossible with the long sticks.
But education, Dr. Smith at RAND finds, may somehow teach people to delay gratification. For example, he reported that in one large federal study of middle-aged people, those with less education were less able to think ahead. ''Most of adherence is unpleasant,'' Dr. Smith says. ''You have to be willing to do something that is not pleasant now and you have to stay with it and think about the future.'' He deplores the dictums to live in the moment or to live for today. That advice, Dr. Smith says, is ''the worst thing for your health.'' An Observation on the Street In the late 1970's, Lisa Berkman, now a professor of public policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, took at part-time job at a San Francisco health care center. It drew people from Chinatown and the city's Italian neighborhood, North Beach, as well as from the Tenderloin district, a poor area where homeless people lived on the streets and mentally ill people roamed. And she noticed something striking.
Few believed him, until, in 1993, a colon cancer specialist at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Francis M. Giardiello, published a paper in The New England Journal of Medicine reporting that he had confirmed the observation in a small clinical trial with 22 of his own patients who had the inherited disorder, familial adenomatous polyposis. In the meantime, Dr. DuBois, of Vanderbilt-Ingram, noticed that in large population studies, people who happened to be taking aspirin daily for other ailments, like arthritis, had half as much colon and rectal cancer as the rest of the population. Soon, others began finding presumptive though not conclusive evidence. ''There are 30 published studies, involving millions of individuals, and 28 suggest benefit from aspirin and aspirinlike drugs,'' Dr. Hawk said. Even the mechanism is understood, Dr. DuBois said. Aspirin inhibits an enzyme in cells, cyclooxygenase-2. Dr. DuBois and others have shown that this enzyme is involved in the development of cancer, allowing cells to make prostaglandins. Prostaglandins act like local hormones, spurring cell growth and preventing cell death, whether the cells are normal or cancerous. Prostaglandins also attract blood vessels to tumors, helping to keep them nourished.
''There will be patients who say, 'Over all, there is a small benefit for patients in my situation, so unless you can tell me there is no benefit, I want chemotherapy,' '' Dr. Winer said. ''And there will be others who say, 'The overall benefit is small to moderate, and if you can't tell me that I will be the one to benefit from chemotherapy, I will forgo it.' '' The second paper, also published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, involved a federal study of more than 10,700 healthy women whose uteruses had been removed. The question was, What are the health consequences of taking estrogen for the relief of menopausal symptoms? The new report does not apply to most menopausal women, just to those who have had hysterectomies, the only women in the study. The difference is important because women who have had hysterectomies can take estrogen alone. But other women cannot because it can cause uterine cancer. For them, estrogen must be combined with another hormone, a form of progesterone, to counter the cancer-causing effect.
If the concern is heart attack risk, he said, ''we were as clear as could be that there seems to be a window of opportunity to use it in that short interval, but there is not a window of opportunity into the future,'' Dr. Rossouw said. ''And we know for sure that if you start taking it in older age, it is bad news for heart disease.'' Correction:  April 6, 2007, Friday  An article on Wednesday about an analysis of studies on the effects of hormone therapy for menopause misstated the results of a study on the risks of taking estrogen alone as hormone therapy. Estrogen alone increased the risk of stroke; it did not also increase the risk of breast cancer. The article also omitted the name of the journal that published the analysis. It was the Journal of the American Medical Association.
There are a variety of hypotheses to explain aging, but this group, whose members have a range of specialties, was especially impressed by one that held that the secret of aging was in the genes. They noted that with just a few genetic alterations, scientists had created worms and fruit flies that have life spans twice the norm and that die healthy and vigorous -- the worm or fly equivalent of being 90 and looking 45. Even mice have lived twice as long as normal with a simple genetic mutation. Dr. Michael Rose, a professor in the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California at Irvine, said there was nothing like creating one of these long-lived organisms to make someone a believer. ''I've created postponed-aging with my own hands,'' he said. ''I know what it feels like to see one organism on its last legs and another organism that is the same age doing fine.''
It is, of course, only a dream. But it is also not as far-fetched as it sounds, experts say. In the past few years, researchers have found evidence suggesting that statins, drugs taken by millions of Americans to lower cholesterol levels, may also protect against Alzheimer's. The drugs, experts are quick to say, will never be a panacea. ''I have little hope that giving statins will eradicate Alzheimer's,'' Dr. Relkin said. ''They are not a magic bullet.'' Still, it is possible that statins may slow Alzheimer's or prevent some cases of it. Or at least, that is the hope of researchers who have found unexpected links between cholesterol and Alzheimer's. The first hints emerged about a decade ago, when Alzheimer's researchers noticed a link between apo E, a protein that carries cholesterol in the blood, and the disease. Everyone inherits one of three versions of apo E. But people with the variant called apo E4 had an increased risk of Alzheimer's, the researchers found.
Dr. Tunis, of the Medicare services center, says he understood that the costs of new technologies can be staggering. But he adds that cost has traditionally not been a consideration in deciding what to cover. ''If the technology was effective, we would find a way to pay for it,'' he said. ''There is no dollar value per life per year at which Medicare would decline to pay.'' But costs are mounting. The agency just approved implantable defibrillators, which can shock a failing heart, preventing sudden death. They cost $30,000 per patient. Medicare restricted the devices to patients with specific patterns of disease, denying payment for them to about half of the million or more patients who could benefit, according to a large study. But now it is under intense pressure from doctors, patients and professional societies to expand its coverage to all those who met the study's criteria. Then there are coated stents, tiny cages coated with drugs to prop open arteries and prevent the blood vessels from closing again. Each costs $3,200, compared with about $1,000 for the older, uncoated stents.
The fecal test was mired in controversy because it was marketed for about 30 years before there was compelling evidence that it reduced the colon cancer death rate, he said. Colon cancers begin as harmless polyps that can be found and removed. Some researchers had hoped that screening tests could help prevent the disease. If so, they said, the testing would offer an unprecedented opportunity to attack a devastating and common cancer. In the study, there were 417 cases of the cancer among 15,532 people who were offered annual fecal blood tests; 435 cancer cases among 15,550 people offered the test every other year; and 507 cases among the 15,363 people who did not have the test -- a 20 percent reduction in the cancer rate among those who were offered the screening test. ''What we had until now is evidence that early detection reduces the mortality from colon cancer,'' said Dr. Steven Woolf, a professor of family medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study. ''But early detection presumes the cancer already exists. This takes us to a new level.''
The study is continuing to enroll patients, said Dr. Gail Weinmannof the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda, Md., which is directing it. From now on, however, patients like the ones who did so poorly will not be included. ''The message is, you should not have this surgery outside the trial until the full results are in,'' said Dr. Barry Make, a participating lung surgeon at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver. But even though the operation is still being studied, many surgeons are selling it to patients because they believe it works. Unlike drugs or medical devices, surgery is not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. That means surgeons can offer new procedures without first proving that they are safe and effective, Dr. Make said. It also means that when a new operation seems promising, a market for it can spring up overnight.
His reaction, said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, president and chief executive of the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, a nonprofit group in Newton, Mass., illustrates why overhauling health care is so difficult in the United States. ''We could get the same or better results with half the money, but the flows of money do not allow you to find the waste and reinvest it,'' said Dr. Berwick, who is also a co-director of Pursuing Perfection, a program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. The foundation made a $1.9 million, three-year grant that helped pay for the Whatcom County project's expenses, like training. Yet the project has attracted attention. ''I think it's very promising,'' said Dr. Mark B. McClellan, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which oversees Medicare. Medicare is starting studies along similar lines, he said. But he is aware of the economic conundrums. ''Often financial incentives are set up to reward more office visits and more complications,'' Dr. McClellan said. ''We will have a lot easier time if we can improve our financial incentives.''
Many patients check out the Internet before they go to their doctors, deciding sometimes what they think their condition is or what drugs they need or which they would refuse to take. Doctors can be taken aback. ''Some doctors deal well with it, some don't,'' Dr. Reardon said. Some doctors make no pretense of being interested in the Internet data of their patients. Dr. Albert Kligman, a dermatology professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School, says he knows what is about to happen when he sees a patient carrying in a pile of printouts from Web sites. ''They say, 'Doctor, I have a few questions,' '' Dr. Kligman said. ''Then they take out about 200 of them. I tell them: 'I only have 12 minutes. I can examine you or I can answer your questions. Make up your mind.' '' Other doctors say that even though they may become frustrated when patients look up every symptom, every diagnosis and every drug on the  Internet, the information can sometimes do more good than harm.
With the spiral CT scans, 23 percent of the people had suspicious nodules but only 2.7 percent of them turned out to have cancer. Almost all the tumors were in Stage 1, meaning they had not yet spread. Chest X-rays found suspicious nodules in 7 percent of the people but only 0.7 percent of them had cancer. Half of the tumors were in Stage 1. The rest were more advanced. Dr. Henschke's paper was published in a British medical journal, The Lancet, last July 10 and reported widely in the news media, setting off a groundswell of demand for the test because she showed that lung cancer could be detected early, and a rush by radiologists to offer it. At Cornell, Dr. Henschke said, smokers and former smokers mobbed the hospital lobby, refusing to leave without spiral CT scanning tests. Over the next six months, radiologists across the country began advertising the scanning tests for lung cancer.
Scientists in South Korea report that they have created human embryos through cloning and extracted embryonic stem cells, the universal cells that hold great promise for medical research. Their goal, the scientists say, is not to clone humans but to advance understanding of the causes and treatment of disease. But the work makes the birth of a cloned baby suddenly more feasible. For that reason, it is likely to reignite the fierce debate over the ethics of human cloning. The work was led by Dr. Woo Suk Hwang and Dr. Shin Yong Moon of Seoul National University and will be published tomorrow in the journal Science. The paper provides a detailed description of how to create human embryos by cloning. Experts in the field not involved with the work said they found the paper persuasive. ''You now have the cookbook, you have a methodology that's publicly available,'' said Dr. Robert Lanza, medical director of a company, Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Mass., that had tried without success to do what the South Koreans did.
Nick Teti, chairman, chief executive and president of Inamed said in an Internet Webcast yesterday, ''This is obviously not the brightest day in the last few years.'' But, Mr. Teti added, ''we are planning very diligently to move forward.'' He said the company also planned to continue development and testing of a newer style of implant that is firmer. ''At this point, our plan is to work cooperatively with the F.D.A. on this application and to actively and aggressively pursue the accumulation of data and the acquisition of data and the submission of data for the cohesive gel product,'' Mr. Teti said. Inamed's stock price fell 12 percent on the news, falling $5.80 to $44 by the end of the day. Another company, the Mentor Corporation, has also applied to the F.D.A. to market its silicone breast implant. The agency's decision is slowing Inamed's push to return silicone implants to the market after an absence of more than a decade.
Dr. Korber asked if it was possible that nothing really special made the epidemic grow, other than an initial transmission that, by chance, did not die out. Could a very slow curve of exponential growth, starting around 1930, end up in an epidemic that finally caught the world's attention around 20 years ago? Her mathematical models showed that it made sense. For the first 30 years, the number of cases would have climbed into the hundreds. As the web of infections grew, the numbers would jump, reaching large numbers in Africa by 1980. At that point, enough people would be infected that the epidemic would be noticed. That model is particularly troubling, Dr. Hahn said. ''If you say, 'I don't know how it got started; it could have been this, it could have been that,' and if all you need are a certain set of circumstances in the beginning so that it doesn't die out, then it could happen again,'' she said.
From New York, where the nightmare of the terrorist attacks was inescapable, to small towns, where the burning buildings and the grim search for bodies could seem so remote as to be unreal, parents have been trying to cope with the question of what, and how much, to tell their children. Should they insist on discussing the events? Should they reassure their children? Should they show their own fears? Some turned to pediatricians, others to psychologists, others to religious leaders or school systems. And others have been trying to muddle through on their own common sense. But while there is no shortage of expert advice, there also is no one formula for helping children cope with such a terrifying event in American history. Psychologists, educators and religious leaders agree that parents should minimize the amount of time their children spend watching the endless replays on television of the attacks and the searches for bodies in the wreckage. They also agree that children wanted and needed to talk to their parents about what happened, whether or not the children initiated the discussions. Children wanted to be reassured and they wanted to know that they were safe. But they were not helped by false reassurances or evasions, experts said.
''We're all fascinated as to why this should be,'' Dr. Berg said. In part, he said, it might be because the American public is convinced that cancer screening is an unmitigated good, making women and their doctors reluctant to give up a test as simple and popular as the Pap. ''We have a thing in this country about cancer screening,'' Dr. Berg said. ''It has a deep social value, and when evidence points in another direction, people are very skeptical.'' Another possibility, Dr. Sirovich said, is that evaluations of doctors and health care systems count the percentage of women who have Pap tests, giving little incentive to advise against the tests. Gynecologists are also puzzled. ''It's kind of hard to figure out,'' said Dr. Kenneth Noller, who is professor and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts-New England Medical Center. Dr. Noller is an author of the cervical cancer screening guidelines issued by the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, which does not recommend Pap tests for most women who have had hysterectomies.
Dr. Victor Fuchs is an economist who also sees himself as a humanist, a person who is interested in values and who inquires how economics can help people to think about social problems and arrive at solutions. Economics, he explains, is about choice. It asks how people respond to incentives, how they respond to constraints. And so, Dr. Fuchs observes, ''economics is the quintessential policy science.'' Dr. Fuchs, an emeritus professor of economics, holds half a dozen titles at Stanford University and is continuing his research while serving on the steering committee of Stanford's Center for Biomedical Ethics and as a research associate of the National Bureau of Economic Research. He is also a past president of the American Economic Association and a member of the American Philosophical Society and of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Sciences. Dr. Fuchs, 76, visited Princeton University last week, lecturing and meeting with graduate students. On a gray and chilly morning, sitting at a small square table in a drafty section of his hotel's breakfast room, he discussed how economic analysis could inform the nation's wrenching debates about health care.
The first study to compare two powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs head-to-head in coronary artery disease finds that one appears to be superior. In patients taking pravastatin, or Pravachol, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, atherosclerosis worsened slowly over 18 months. But the disease was halted in those who took the highest dose of atorvastatin, or Lipitor, the drug made by Pfizer. ''We saw something extraordinary,'' said Dr. Steven Nissen, the cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic who directed the study of 502 patients. ''All statins are not alike,'' Dr. Nissen said, adding that with pravastatin, heart atherosclerosis will worsen, but with the highest dose of atorvastatin, that is unlikely. At the study's start, the middle-aged, mostly male heart disease patients in the study had levels of low density lipoproteins, or L.D.L., of 150, on average. L.D.L. carries cholesterol to arteries. Atorvastatin lowered participants' L.D.L. levels to 79, while those taking pravastatin had an average level of 110.
Meanwhile, even Dr. Smith, who is circumspect about wholesale CRP testing, could not resist finding out his own level. It was fine, he says. And some doctors who have had the test cannot resist bragging if their level is low. Dr. Cannon said that not long ago he was staying at a hotel for a medical meeting and went to the exercise room at 6 in the morning to work out. There he saw two prominent cardiologists, one on the treadmill and the other on the elliptical cross-trainer. The men were talking, comparing their CRP levels. ''Mine is 0.4,'' one said. The other puffed out his chest. ''Mine,'' he declared, ''is 0.2.''
But innate immunity may also stop viruses at other steps in the infection, Dr. Landau and his colleagues reported last summer. They found a protein that prevents the monkey AIDS virus from taking hold in human cells by mutating the viral genes, making the genes so aberrant that the viral DNA is destroyed by scavenger enzymes in cells. The protein does not protect against the human AIDS virus, the researchers found, because H.I.V. has evolved a viral protein that interferes with the mutation process. Researchers say they are just beginning to understand innate immunity. ''There's an exploding number of these genes that so far as we know have these antiviral activities,'' said Dr. Stephen P. Goff, a professor of biochemistry and biophysics and a Howard Hughes investigator at Columbia University. ''Presumably they evolved for that reason.'' For now, Dr. Sodroski said, there are many more questions than answers. Could differences in TRIM5-alpha explain the differences in people's responses to H.I.V.?
Dr. Spiegel published that observation in 1989 but cautioned that the original study was not designed to look at mortality and that the question needed to be addressed in a rigorous study. But the theory took on a life of its own. Some groups, like the American Cancer Society, which wanted to test the hypothesis, had a hard time finding women who would agree to participate in a clinical trial. Most women simply wanted to be in support groups, Dr. Eyre said. The society's study ended up so small that when it found no life-prolonging effect in support groups, it was not clear whether the study had simply missed it, Dr. Eyre said. Dr. Spiegel is conducting his own study, of 125 patients, but he, too, had problems enrolling them. It took him five years to recruit the women, he said, adding that many refused to be in the study because they believed so strongly in the power of a support group to prolong their lives.
Dr. Daniel Solomon, a rheumatologist and epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said yesterday that he was convinced enough by the data that he stopped prescribing Vioxx two years ago. Dr. Solomon scoffed at Merck's assertion that the new data were unexpected. ''I was like, 'Please. Really,''' Dr. Solomon said. But others, including Dr. Michael Lockshin, an arthritis specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, were less certain. Dr. Lockshin said that, until now, ''the data were quite minor'' to indicate that Vioxx was causing a problem. The original study's findings had an alternative explanation, he said, and the other studies were complicated by the fact that they lacked enough rigor to make the case. The new data, however, convinced him. Even if Merck had not withdrawn the drug, he would no longer prescribe it, Dr. Lockshin said. ''Although the numbers are not huge in terms of risk, these are the things that I, looking at it as a practitioner, couldn't say, 'Oh, well. This drug is as safe as another.'''
''As altruistic as women and feminists want to be, the reality is that we can only stay in business if we earn enough to keep our doors open,'' Ms. Chelian said. Fighting the Price Wars After working at abortion clinics for 25 years, Kathryn Allen seized an opportunity to own one. The doctor running the Scotsdale Women's Center, a small brick building painted a dusky rose on a bleak treeless street in Detroit, was in his 60's and his practice had dwindled. So, in 1997, Ms. Allen and her daughter, Shelly Miller, took over, getting a doctor to do abortions and deciding to charge $275 for a first-trimester abortion -- significantly less than the average fee in the United States, which was $316 in 1996. But then a nearby clinic, which had been charging $250 for students and $285 for others, dropped its fee to $175. Ms. Allen could not compete.
That response included more nerve growth factor in their brains, a substance that prompts nerve cells to grow, survive and be more resistant to disease. In addition, when intermittently dieting mice ate, their blood sugar levels were better than those of animals that were not dieting, what Dr. Mattson calls ''a sort of anti-diabetic effect.'' And when he placed them under stress by immobilizing them with tiny straitjackets or making them swim in cold water, the dieting mice recovered much faster than the others. Scientists say exercise, too, may prolong life by providing low-level stress. In studies, rodents live longer on average with regular exercise, largely because they are less prone to cancer. That regular physical exercise also increases the levels of nerve growth factor in animals' brains, in much the same way as intermittent fasting does. Study after study has observed that people who engage in moderate exercise most days of the week (say, a brisk walk) live longer, but it is not clear why. They do not exercise enough to lose weight, nor enough to make much difference in their blood pressure or their cholesterol levels.
''What's in it for an ob-gyn? That's the way they think.''
''I worry about hysteria mongers who say, 'Oh my God, if you have these procedures you are doomed,' '' Dr. Mitchell said. Fertility experts were cautious in their reactions. Dr. James Grifo, the president of the Society of Assisted Reproductive Technology and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the New York University School of Medicine, noted that the studies did not show cause and effect, but just associations. Commenting on the study of birth weight, Dr. Grifo said he suspected that a subset of women who required fertility treatments had medical conditions like uterine abnormalities that resulted in their babies' having lower weights. ''What needs to be done is to find that cause and identify the patients at higher risk,'' Dr. Grifo said. ''You have to ask what is the clinical significance? Does it hurt the baby? ''Let's say you identify the population that is at risk. Do you tell them, 'We're sorry, but you can't become pregnant?' ''
Their efforts have reduced doctor visits and medical complications. Patients with diabetes have lower glucose levels; those with congestive heart failure have remained stable rather than getting worse. And money is saved. For example, in just two months, in January and February, the two nurses, seeing 70 patients, reported seven incidents in which they prevented costly options like calls to 911, emergency room visits and emergency visits to a doctor's office. Ms. Bryson said her clinical care specialist, Nancy Stothart, helped her avoid doctor visits through simple steps like taking her blood pressure. Ms. Stothart also recognized serious problems when Ms. Bryson did not. Once it was severe dehydration; another time it was a pacemaker wire that had been dislodged. ''Nancy saved my life -- twice,'' Ms. Bryson said. Mr. Littlefield was one of those needy patients who ended up with a clinical care specialist because doctors were at their wits' end. These patients, the doctors said, were simply not following instructions.
For PET scans for people with suspected Alzheimer's disease, Medicare announced on Sept. 15 that it would pay only if patients are in a clinical trial in which they will be randomly assigned to have a PET scan of the brain, or not. The agency wants to know whether early diagnoses with the PET scans make a difference in the medical care that patients receive, the course of their disease, and outcomes like the time before patients are admitted to a nursing home. The makers of PET scanners have agreed to do a clinical trial with Medicare beneficiaries, said Dr. David Rollo, the chief medical officer for Siemens Medical Systems. He said that there are many logistical problems to sort out in this first-ever industry-wide collaboration because each machine is different, ''each manufacturer brags that theirs is the best'' and yet, in the study, the brain images must be comparable no matter what machine is used.
''A separate question, that is not answered here but that certainly can be answered,'' he said, ''is how should a patient you identify as high risk be treated? Which cocktail of chemicals is most likely to yield responses?'' The advance, for cancers in general, will be substantial, Dr. Golub predicted. ''The way we do it now is to give everyone the same treatment, knowing that not everyone will respond. For those who don't respond, we say, 'O.K., let's go to plan B,' but by then they often are sicker, their tumors have progressed, and they have side effects of their initial treatment.'' With genetic signatures, he said, ''you would give a therapy to those most likely to be cured and go directly to an alternative therapy for those who aren't.'' Researchers say the next few years will be crucial. More studies are looking at genetic signatures of tumor cells. ''There is a tsunami of data'' that will appear soon in medical journals, said Dr. Marc Lippman, a breast cancer expert who heads the department of medicine at the University of Michigan School of Medicine. All the studies, researchers say, need to be followed by large prospective clinical trials.
But that does not necessarily mean that drugs should be the first choice for people with so-called prediabetes, who have elevated blood sugar levels but have not yet developed the disease. Or so says Rena Wing, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University Medical School. Dr. Wing helped develop the diet and exercise program for the federal study of prediabetes. Drugs, she said, should be a last resort for people with prediabetes. The answer to the problem of poor compliance with diet and exercise programs is to develop better ways of encouraging people to follow them, she said. ''If you have a problem that can be solved with a lifestyle change, you have to work on how to do that, how to bring it to people,'' Dr. Wing said. ''We have to change the system.'' For example, she said, there could be lists of effective programs for weight loss and exercise so doctors would stop telling patients to simply ''lose weight'' and say instead, ''Join this program.''
Their increased risk was about equal to that reported for the entire study: hormone therapy would result in an extra 8 out of 10,000 women per year being found to have breast cancer. But, Dr. Chlebowski added, to rigorously test whether the cancer risk occurs with shorter term use scientists will have to conduct another study, with some women taking the drugs for one year, some for two, some three, and so on. Dr. Richard Hodes, the director of the National Institute on Aging, said, ''People who are presuming that there is no increased risk unless you have been taking hormones for four or five years are overinterpreting what the study says.'' The federal study's findings were a shock to many of the six million American women who were taking the study drug, Prempro, which is a combination of estrogen and progestin. The drug's maker, Wyeth, says sales have fallen by 40 percent but added that it did not know how many who dropped Prempro were taking another company's hormone replacement drug and how many had stopped taking hormone replacement altogether.
When the drug Eldepryl, which can prolong the actions of L-dopa in the brain, was introduced about a decade ago, the researchers overlooked its potential as a treatment for impotence. In fact, a a comedy team was used to emphasize what at the time seemed to be its amusing side effect. On a stage in front of about 2,000 sales representatives, the people who would be promoting the drug to doctors and health organizations, actors playing a ''Senor El Dopa'' and a ''Senorita Eldepryl'' bantered suggestively before the group, said Dr. Olanow, who was in the audience. Finally, he recalled: ''Senor El Dopa said: 'I must leave you. I'm starting to fade.' Senorita Eldepryl looked up at him and replied, 'You don't have to. I can enhance your potency.' ''  Dr. Olanow had to make the next presentation: a dry scientific talk on Eldepryl. He put up his first slide, which showed the chemical structure of the drug and heard the audience groan. Then he had a flash of brilliance. ''This,'' he recalled saying, ''is what Senorita Eldepryl looks like without her clothes on.''
For those of us with dozens of moles, the spots speckling our skin can seem no more significant than freckles. But it turns out, each mole is a tumor of pigment cells that started on a path to cancer and then stopped. The cells do not divide again. A mole is an incipient cancer that halted in its tracks. It is a view that has surprised even scientists. Moles, it turns out, are a sort of strange hybrid in the cancer spectrum. They are little benign tumors, meaning they are harmless, with cells that cannot spread through the body like a cancerous tumor and kill a person. But moles start out the same way that malignant tumors start out, with a mutated gene that lets cells proliferate wildly. ''Moles are real tumors,'' said Dr. Wolter J. Mooi, a pathologist at the Vrije University Medical Center in the Netherlands. If mole cells did not stop growing, he said, ''chances are that by the time we were 10 years old, we would not only have very large moles, but some might well have progressed to fully malignant melanomas.''
At one point, Mr. Thomas was injured, and he did not run for five months. When he was ready to return to running, he called Dr. Wolfe and suggested they run together. They set off at a fast clip, with Mr. Thomas setting a five-and-a-half minute-per-mile pace. ''I was just dying, trying to keep up,'' Dr. Wolfe recalled. He accosted Mr. Thomas. How could it be that after all those months away from running, he could cruise along at such a speed, with no apparent effort? Mr. Thomas replied that he had always been able to run at that pace. ''That was a watershed for me,'' Dr. Wolfe said. ''That's when I realized that no matter how hard I train, I will never get to that level.'' Correction:  August 19, 2004, Thursday  An article in Science Times on Aug. 10 about running techniques misstated the achievements of one runner, Brook Thomas. Mr. Thomas was an all-American while running for Stanford University in cross country, and competed in the Olympic marathon trial in 1972, but dropped out before the finish. He did not come in fourth.
And the strokes in the statistics are only the beginning. For every stroke that doctors know about, there are 5 to 10 tiny, silent strokes, said Dr. Vladimir Hachinski, the editor of the journal Stroke and a neurologist at the London Health Sciences Centre in Ontario. ''They are only silent because we don't ask questions,'' Dr. Hachinski said. ''They do not involve memory, but they involve judgment, planning ahead, shifting your attention from one thing to another. And they also may involve late-life depression.'' They are also warning signs that a much larger stroke may be on the way. Most strokes would never happen if people took simple measures like controlling their blood pressure. Few do. Many say they forget to take medication; others, like Dr. Fite, decide not to. Some have no idea they need the drugs. Still, there is much more hope now, said Dr. Ralph L. Sacco, professor and chairman of neurology at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami. Like most stroke neurologists, Dr. Sacco entered the field more than a decade ago, when little could be done for such patients.
For example, a primary initiative is to save money, for drug companies and consumers, by speeding up drug approval. ''It costs $800 million or more to develop a new drug,'' Dr. McClellan said. ''That's double what it cost a decade ago.'' If that price can be reduced, the price consumers pay should also be lower, he said. One factor in the cost of new drugs is the necessary tests for safety and effectiveness. There, Dr. McClellan said, the agency can make a difference. He is looking for better ways of deciding early whether a drug is going to work, using genetic markers, for example, that might indicate whether a drug is converting a cancer cell into a normal one. And he will be doing what economists call a root cause analysis every time a drug is reviewed by the F.D.A. only to be sent back to the company, unapproved, for more testing before finally being approved. What went wrong? he will be asking. Why couldn't it be approved the first time around?
Researchers in New York report that millions of lives could be saved by detecting lung cancer early with annual CT scans and treating it immediately, when it can still be cured. The stakes are high: while death rates for other cancers have fallen, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in this country, killing more than 160,000 people a year. For years, doctors have thought there was little they could do for lung cancer, but now with more sensitive scans, many are rethinking that view. ''You could prevent 80 percent of deaths,'' said the study's lead author, Dr. Claudia Henschke, a professor of radiology and cardiothoracic surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College. But the report is controversial. Some medical experts and a patient advocacy group say that because this study is so much bigger than previous studies and so carefully done, it should change the testing landscape, while others say that it did not include comparison groups to demonstrate clearly that there is any benefit from annual CT exams.
So the agency asked the nation's hospitals to report how well they did in providing these treatments if they wanted this year's cost-of-living increase in Medicare payments. Ninety-eight percent complied. Medicare expects that now that the hospitals' performances are public, many will try to improve. ''People will begin to feel a little awkward if everyone else is doing better and they're not,'' Dr. Jencks said. The next step, Dr. Jencks said, is ''aligning payment with what you want people to do.'' To that end, Medicare has a pilot program to pay hospitals for improving on a number of quality measures, including mortality rates and readmission rates for hip or knee surgery. Hospitals in the top 10 percent for a given condition, for example, will be paid an extra 2 percent. The agency will pay less if performance deteriorates. The project involves 278 hospitals affiliated with Premier, a nationwide organization of nonprofit hospitals.
For his part, Mr. Iacocca was confident from the start that Dr. Faustman's work was correct. His foundation's scientific advisers strongly endorsed it, and Mr. Iacocca, whose wife, Mary, died of diabetes complications, has a personal interest. ''I can't wait for the pharmaceutical companies or even government tax money to fund what looks promising,'' Mr. Iacocca said. ''They are not known for high risk and they are also slow to react. We are trying to get a cure.'' I BEG TO DIFFER
But in the real world, a burglar confronted by an impenetrable lock on the front door may well go round to the back and just smash a window.  ''I'm a cryptographer by trade,'' Mr. Schneier said. ''And a provably secure cryptosystem doesn't do me any good. We're putting a stake in the ground and hoping the enemy runs into it and now we're arguing about whether it should be one mile tall or two miles tall. It doesn't matter. The enemy will walk around it,'' he added. Dr. Robert Morris, a retired cryptographer who was chief scientist for the National Security Agency, the nation's code-making and code-breaking agency, also questioned the primacy of cryptography. ''As far as I can see, he seems to be correct -- it's a provably secure method,'' Dr. Morris said. ''But does that mean no one can read it? Nah.'' He explained: ''You can still get the message, but maybe not by cryptanalysis. If you're in this business, you go after a reasonably cheap, reliable method. It may be one of the three B's: burglary, bribery or blackmail. Those are right up there along with cryptanalysis in their importance.''
That may not be so easy, said Dr. William Black, a professor of radiology at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. There are financial and legal incentives for doctors and medical centers to encourage screening tests, he said, and it can take time to sit down with patients and truly explain a test's risks and benefits. For example, Dr. Black said, health maintenance organizations are graded on the percentage of their members who get screenings like Pap tests and mammograms. And even when a test is controversial, like a prostate cancer test, doctors may hesitate to explain what is at stake. That test, the P.S.A., for prostate specific antigen, can lead to the detection of tiny tumors. The problem, however, is that most prostate cancers grow very slowly, and men tend to die with them, not of them. Autopsy studies find that as many as 70 percent of men in their 80's have early prostate cancers that were undetected during their lifetimes and caused no problems.
''Older people are not trying to win Olympic gold medals,'' Dr. Costill said. ''Their goal is to maintain their independence and stay out of nursing homes.'' He and his colleagues hope to figure out the molecular signals that tell younger people to build fast twitch muscles and older people to build slow twitch ones. Maybe, Dr. Costill said, they can figure out the best way for older people to train, to maximize the quality of the muscles they build. Maybe, he said, ''you can cheat aging a little bit.''

They suggest the gene alteration may hold a key to understanding earlier findings that yeast, flies, worms and rodents live far longer than expected if they are fed very little food. If they are right, the researchers said, people may one day obtain the life-prolonging benefits of caloric restriction by taking a drug to slow down the gene, thereby living longer without actually depriving themselves of food. Humans have the same gene, Dr. Helfand said. Researchers who study life spans were intrigued. They emphasized that it is a long road between an observation in fruit flies and a drug that works in humans, but said that the discovery could point research in a new direction. ''I think it's terrific,'' said Dr. James R. Carey, a fruit fly demographer at the University of California at Davis. ''They've known for 60 or 70 years that caloric restriction extends life spans, but no one has nailed down a mechanism. That's why this is really important.'' He said the discovery ''lays the foundation for things that can come together down the road.''
That impression, they said, was generated by a study published in 1997 and then fueled by a separate paper, published in 1999 and endorsed by two subcommittees of the Lawson-Wilkins Pediatric Endocrine Society, saying that puberty was occurring earlier and that the guidelines for determining which girls needed to see specialists should be revised accordingly. (The Endocrine Society, which represents adult and pediatric endocrinologists alike, had never taken a position on the question.) ''This is definitely a retrenchment and a fallback to a more conservative position,'' said one leading critic of the earlier stance, Dr. Robert Rosenfield, a pediatric endocrinologist at the University of Chicago. ''It shows that our concerns have been taken seriously,'' Dr. Rosenfield added. Another critic, Dr. Laura K. Bachrach, a pediatrics professor at Stanford University, said, ''I think it bodes to settle what was the equivalent of a civil war.'' But Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a principal author of the 1999 paper, declined to comment on whether the new statement was a retrenchment. Dr. Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist at the Medical College of Virginia of Virginia Commonwealth University, said instead: ''I feel that the original study showing that puberty is occurring earlier is still valid. But I agree that additional studies need to be done to confirm this finding and to find out why girls are maturing earlier.''
Ms. Barton is the chronic dieter. Food, her weight, her exercise program, she says, are ''always on my mind.'' A recent national survey of 107,804 adults by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that more than two-thirds of Americans, 64 percent of men and 78 percent of women, are either dieting to lose weight or watching what they eat to prevent themselves from gaining weight. Not all are as skillful as Ms. Barton. Dr. Mary K. Serdula, who led the survey, said many tried to control their weight by controlling their fat intake, a strategy that Dr. Serdula and other experts said was ineffective. Or they fail to exercise. But Dr. Serdula said she was not at all surprised that so many Americans wee trying so hard to keep their weight under control. ''Weight is a big concern in America,'' she said. Until recently, obesity experts would have wrung their hands in dismay over such statistics. Chronic dieters, they would have said, either have eating disorders or are on their way to developing them.
It was not to be. The only way to maintain her weight, Ms. Barton learned, was to watch what she ate and to exercise regularly, walking or riding her bike for an hour to an hour and a half each day. Even so, staying at 135 pounds was beyond her. At that weight, she found herself obsessed with food and unable to control her eating. She let her weight creep up to 140 to 145, and she now carefully keeps track of it so it goes no higher. She also gave away her size 8 clothes. ''I'm at the point where I say, 'O.K. I've got more on my hips than probably exceeds my best desire, but I feel great,' '' Ms. Barton said. When she gets depressed about her weight, she goes to a Web site that gives body mass indices, a measurement of obesity, and verifies that she is not even close to being too fat.
In a draft of a long-awaited report on the health effects of the pollutant dioxin, scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency say the chemical is 10 times more likely to cause cancer than previously estimated. Some environmental groups hailed the draft, but some scientists questioned its assertions. People with the highest exposures to dioxin -- those who are older and eat fatty foods -- may have a 1 in 100 chance of getting cancer from the dioxin in their bodies, the report says. Moreover, it says, the chemical can cause other adverse health effects, like developmental delays in children and disruptions in hormone secretions. The agency said the report was still being written, and its conclusions has not been distributed to an E.P.A. scientific advisory board. In fact, a board to evaluate the report is only now being put together. Some scientists said they doubted that the report's conclusions would stand up to a board's scrutiny, and a few were scathing in their assessment, with one expert in clinical toxicology calling the report ''an embarrassment.''
Dr. Feinberg, like Dr. O'Brien, thinks it is inevitable that H.I.V. will alter humanity. So many are infected in some parts of Africa, he said, that future generations will have a disproportionate number of people with genetic predispositions to live with the virus. And that is how evolutionary changes occur. ''It's going to happen,'' Dr. Feinberg said. ''The severity of the epidemic in some parts of the world is so profound that it will clearly impact human evolution.'' ''In the past,'' he added, ''we've been left to infer what the impact of infection was on human evolution.'' Now, he said, ''We will have the opportunity to observe it.''
Over the years, Dr. Friedman says, he has watched the scientific data accumulate to show that body weight, in animals and humans, is not under conscious control. Body weight, he says, is genetically determined, as tightly regulated as height. Genes control not only how much you eat but also the metabolic rate at which you burn food. When it comes to eating, free will is an illusion. ''People can exert a level of control over their weight within a 10-, perhaps a 15-pound range,'' Dr. Friedman said. But expecting an obese person to decide to simply eat less and exercise more to get below the obesity range, below the overweight range? It virtually never happens, he said. Any weight that is lost almost invariably comes right back. The same goes for gaining weight in general, Dr. Friedman argued. A person who has the genes to be thin is not going to get fat because portion sizes increase. It makes no scientific sense, he said.
The lead female marathon runner in the Athens Olympics, running in 97-degree heat drank just 30 seconds of the entire race. In the 2002 Boston Marathon, said Dr. Arthur Siegel, of the Boston Marathon's medical team and the chief of internal medicine at Harvard's McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., the hyponatremia problem ''hit us like a cannon shot'' in 2002. That year, a 28-year-old woman reached Heartbreak Hill, at Mile 20, after five hours of running and drinking sports drinks. She struggled to the top. Feeling terrible and assuming she was dehydrated, she chugged 16 ounces of the liquid. ''She collapsed within minutes,'' Dr. Siegel said. She was later declared brain dead. Her blood sodium level was dangerously low, at 113 micromoles per liter of blood. (Hyponatremia starts at sodium levels below 135 micromoles, when brain swelling can cause confusion and grogginess. Levels below 120 can be fatal.) No one has died since in the Boston Marathon, but there have been near misses there, with 7 cases of hyponatremia in 2003 and 11 last year, and deaths elsewhere, Dr. Siegel said. He added that those were just the cases among runners who came to medical tents seeking help.
Some lawmakers want to ban the research entirely. Senators Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, and Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, reacted with dismay to the company's claims that it had created cloned human embryos. But Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana, was cautious in an interview with ''Late Edition'' on CNN. ''We really ought to take it on the basis of much more thorough understanding than this first report,'' he said. Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota and the majority leader, said he supported cloning of this kind for research purposes. But Mr. Daschle added that he would oppose any human cloning intended to replicate a person, and said such an effort would face overwhelming opposition in Congress if it were ever proposed. President Bush has said he is opposed to the type of cloning described in the announcement today. But in its press release, the company was enthusiastic. The paper ''provides the first proof that reprogrammed human cells can supply tissue for transplantation,'' the company said. The press release quoted Dr. Robert P. Lanza, the company's president of medical and scientific development and an author of the paper.
''Obviously, our lives were shattered,'' Mr. Greenberg said. ''It was a tough haul trying to think of your child as a dying child and never being able to do the things that other children can do.'' Then the Greenbergs' second child, Amy, turned out to have the disease, too. Desolate, Mr. Greenberg eventually decided that maybe something good could come out of his tragedy if he could help scientists find the gene that, when mutated, leads to Canavan disease. In 1987, he found a researcher who was eager to do the work, Dr. Reuben Matalon at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. Mr. Greenberg said he organized tens of thousands of dollars in donations and grants for the project, including several thousand dollars of his own money, and helped Dr. Matalon obtain blood, urine and skin biopsy samples from children with Canavan disease and their parents. Dr. Matalon began making progress. Then he was recruited by Miami Children's Hospital, which wanted him to establish a center for research on genetic diseases, with a multimillion-dollar annual budget. At the University of Illinois Hospital, Dr. Matalon said, his research budget, excluding donations, had been no more than $10,000 a year.
A Scottish company, PPL Therapeutics, announced yesterday that its scientists had cloned a pig, creating five identical piglets. The goal, PPL said, is to use the technology to create genetically altered pigs whose organs can be transplanted into humans without being rejected by the human immune system. PPL provided no details of how the cloning was done or even how many efforts were needed to succeed. Instead, the company issued a news release announcing that a pig had been cloned. Dr. David Ayares, the vice president of research and development at PPL, said yesterday that he hoped the announcement would attract investors. The company had been talking with drug companies, venture capitalists and investment bankers, he said. Dr. Ayares, who works at the company's laboratories in Blacksburg, Va., said PPL hoped to publish the details of the pig cloning in a scientific journal, either Science or Nature. It was scientists at PPL, working with others at the Roslin Institute, who in 1996 first cloned an adult mammal, a sheep. They delayed announcement about the sheep, named Dolly, until the company had filed for patents, notifying the world with a paper published in Nature in 1997.
''They are trying to go back on estrogen,'' Dr. Schiff said. But, he added, ''They do not want to go on Prempro.'' While the level of marketing for alternative drugs and supplements is impossible to quantify in the short time since the findings about Prempro were reported, Dr. Schiff and others say they have been bombarded with fliers, e-mail promotions and visits from drug salespeople. A similar barrage is going out to patients, in the form of advertisements in newspapers and magazines, in the mail and on the Web. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolgists has warned its members that it is not necessarily safe to switch women from Prempro to other prescription hormones, adding, ''Caution is warranted for different preparations, and their safety should not be assumed in the absence of conclusive data.'' But prescription hormones are only part of the picture. Doctors say they are particularly concerned about the promotion of nutritional supplements.
Still, it has not been demonstrated that a fall in CRP when someone stops smoking, for example, confers any more protection from heart disease than simply stopping smoking. Some scientists suspect that it does. Others say they await evidence. But many, including Dr. Cannon, say it makes sense to use a high CRP level as a motivating factor to change bad habits. ''When you're faced with a test that shows that you're at increased cardiac risk -- and this is your blood, your body -- it can resonate,'' he said. With his patient Mr. Newton, Dr. Cannon said, ''I think it's helping him worry about stopping smoking.'' Mr. Newton says he is trying to quit. He now smokes just a few cigarettes a day -- down from a pack -- and plans to have his CRP tested again in six months. In the meantime, it is a nagging concern. And because the average CRP drop with smoking cessation is 0.5, chances are that even if he stopped smoking entirely, he still would have a level that conferred risk.
Many say its supposed genesis, a rush of endorphins into the brain, is without scientific evidence and some say the whole endorphin-runner's-high hypothesis is the scientific version of an urban legend. ''I believe this endorphin-in-runners is a total fantasy in the pop culture,'' said Dr. Huda Akil, an endorphin researcher at the University of Michigan, who is president-elect of the Society for Neuroscience. Yet only now are a few researchers rigorously examining exercise as an addictive behavior. They are finding that exercise, in rats at least, may actually be addictive but that it is not at all clear that the crucial brain chemical is an endorphin. The hypothesis that there is a runner's high and that it is caused by endorphins emerged in the 1970's, when scientists found a new class of brain chemicals that act just like morphine. ''We had meetings to decide what to call it,'' said Dr. Solomon Snyder, a neurobiologist at Johns Hopkins University, with a committee deciding on ''endorphin.'' The word is an amalgam of endogenous, meaning made by the body, and morphine.
Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, the scientific director for clinical research at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said she was withholding judgment on the question of whether hormone replacement therapy protects against heart disease. She noted that the average age of the women in the study of artery narrowing was 65, long after they had entered menopause. ''Would hormone replacement therapy possibly be more effective if it was initiated at the onset of menopause?'' Dr. Nabel asked. In addition, she said that while the women in Dr. Herrington's study  were followed for only three years, ''it may be that protective effects may be apparent only years later.'' Nonetheless, most experts said, the data are not encouraging. They added that a study now under way, involving 25,000 women, most of whom did not have heart disease, was also finding hints that estrogen might not help women's hearts. In April, directors of that study,  known as the Women's Health Initiative, informed its participants that those taking estrogen were having slightly more heart attacks than those taking a placebo, possibly because of estrogen's well-known proclivity to encourage blood clots in susceptible women.
A result, said Col. John Holcomb, who directs the Army Institute of Surgical Research in San Antonio, should be a vast improvement in trauma care. Trauma ''can be prevented and treated,'' he said. ''It really is a disease.'' Lt. Col. Jimmie Keenan, the Army nurse who helped bring on the change, said her eyes were opened one day in June 1999 when a 32-year-old Albanian man was carried into a 30-bed field hospital where she was the head nurse. ''He was more dead than alive,'' she said. The man had gunshot wounds on the right and left sides of his chest, his abdomen, back and left ear, as well as injuries to his right hand. He was bleeding rapidly, and even after surgeons repaired some of his wounds, it looked as if he was going to die for lack of blood. So the staff members with a matching blood type rolled up their sleeves and gave the man their own blood. They saved his life.
Even when the immediate rejection is prevented, though, scientists still have to block a long-term rejection process that takes place weeks later. ''That really is the limiting factor,'' Dr. Logan said.
Not everyone who takes Vioxx does so for 18 months or longer. Or even daily. Some arthritis patients take it only during flare-ups. And other people might take it only for several months, after a sports injury, for example. Medical experts say that it is safe for patients to abruptly stop taking Vioxx, adding that there are many alternatives to the drug, including cheap over-the-counter drugs. One of those, aspirin, is much cheaper than Vioxx, which has sold for $2.50 or more a pill. Vioxx provides about the same pain relief as aspirin, although studies showed that patients taking Vioxx were less likely to develop ulcers or gastrointestinal bleeding. There are also two prescription drugs, Celebrex and Bextra, both made by Pfizer, which are similar to Vioxx but have not been shown to pose cardiovascular risks. That, and Pfizer's extensive advertising, may help explain why sales of Celebrex have lately been twice those for Vioxx. The F.D.A. says, however, that studies of Celebrex and Bextra have lasted only a year, and the Vioxx study found risks only after people had taken it for 18 months.
A small study of heart disease patients testing a hypothesis so improbable its principal investigator says he gave it a one-in-10,000 chance of succeeding has found that just a few treatments with an experimental drug reversed what may be the equivalent of years' worth of plaque in coronary arteries. The results, published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, involved just 47 heart attack patients. They were randomly assigned to be infused with one of two concentrations of a substance that mimics high density lipoprotein, or H.D.L., the substance that removes cholesterol from arteries, or to be infused with saline, which served as a control. After five weekly infusions, those who got the experimental drug had a 4.2 percent decrease in the volume of plaque in their coronary arteries, while those who had saline infusions had if anything a slight increase in their plaque. In contrast, said Dr. Steven E. Nissen, a Cleveland Clinic cardiologist, who directed the study, the most powerful statins take years to show more modest effects. Statins lower levels of low density lipoproteins, or L.D.L., which deliver cholesterol to the coronary arteries.
For example, a family practice doctor in Maine, who asked not to be identified, said he was so committed to providing abortions that he secretly worked nights at an abortion clinic in another town 40 miles away. He said he would offer mifepristone at that clinic. But if one of his regular patients asks for the drug, he does not plan to provide it. And, he said, his partner in his family practice as well as the other doctors in his town are not interested in providing it either. ''The greater good that I do is the abortion work I do out of town,'' the doctor explained. ''My first obligation is to those patients. If I were to offer mifepristone in my office, and risk picketing, that would compromise what I regard as my important abortion work elsewhere.'' Dr. Steven Tamarin, a New York doctor in family practice, also applauds the approval of mifepristone.  A member of the board of directors of Physicians for Reproductive Choice and Health, an organization of about 2,000 doctors who promote abortion rights, Dr. Tamarin said he was not worried about abortion opponents. But he has another concern: the time it takes to provide a mifepristone abortion. The drug agency requires that the women be counseled about the pill before using it.
In animal studies of chemicals that cause birth defects, timing and dose are critical, and scientists believe the same is true for humans. Asking women to recall the time of their exposure and then asking if they had had a headache when they thought they were exposed is not sufficient, said Dr. Lewis Holmes,  chief of the unit that studies genetics and birth defects at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Dr. Holmes and Dr. Allen Mitchell, who directs the Slone Epidemiology Unit at the Boston University School of Public Health, noted that the women in the study were not randomly selected. Half who said they had been exposed to organic solvents had had previous miscarriages -- compared to a fifth of the women in the control group -- which could mean that it was the genetic makeup of the parents, and not the workplace, that caused the high rate of birth defects, Dr. Holmes and Dr. Mitchell said.
The Families I  Searching for Good From Sorrow Daniel M. Greenberg, a real estate lawyer in Homewood, Ill., never thought about potential profit when he helped get a gene search going. All he wanted was to help other families avoid what had happened to him and his wife. The Greenbergs' first child, Jonathan, was born on June 12, 1981, a perfect present for their fourth anniversary. But they soon began to worry. Jonathan did not roll over when he was supposed to. He never sat up. Finally, when Jonathan was a year old, a neurologist discovered that he had Canavan disease, a rare genetic disorder that is invariably fatal and almost exclusively strikes Ashkenazi Jews, those who trace their origins to Eastern and Central Europe. The Greenbergs were told that Jonathan's condition would only get worse and that he would die before he was a teenager. (He died when he was 11 years old.)
With esophageal cancer, for example, ''you literally double your odds by going to a high-volume center,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. The five-year survival rate for patients going to hospitals that did four or fewer esophageal operations a year was 17 percent. The five-year survival rate for patients going to hospitals that did more than 14 operations a year was 34 percent. Dr. Robert J. Downey, a thoracic surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he stopped doing operations for esophageal cancer because he was doing only about one a month, not enough, he decided, for optimal results. Yet Dr. Birkmeyer's study finds that fully a third of patients have the operation at hospitals doing four or fewer such surgeries in a year. It may not matter, Dr. Downey said, whether someone with esophageal cancer ''goes to a Memorial Sloan-Kettering or a Columbia-Presbyterian,'' two of New York's teaching hospitals. What matters, he said, is whether they go to a hospital that does more than just a few operations. With breast cancer, Dr. Birkmeyer said, women who go to medical centers that see large numbers of such patients tend to live longer than women who go to centers that see fewer.
But Dr. Anversa wanted to learn where those new heart cells came from. Are they already in the heart or do they come from elsewhere, like the bone marrow? Marrow is known to have immature cells that, in theory, can develop into specialized cells if they are given the right biochemical signals. He and his colleagues hit upon a way to find out. They would look at men who had received heart transplants from women. Male cells have a Y chromosome, and female cells do not. So if, on autopsy, the female hearts that were implanted in men contained mature cells with Y chromosomes, that would be proof that the cells originated outside the heart, coming from the man's own cells, possibly from stem cells already present in his body and ready, when signaled, to become heart cells. Reporting in the Jan. 3 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Anversa and his colleagues said there were abundant male cells in the female hearts.
''You can't minimize this,'' said Dr. Flemming Graae, the director of child and adolescent psychiatric services at the Westchester Division of New York Presbyterian Hospital in White Plains. ''You can't hide the reality of what is going on.'' But, he added, ''You can't open a book and decide how much you're going to tell a 10-year-old about terrorism.'' Dr. Robert Lifton, who is in the department of psychiatry at Harvard University, said that in his studies of how children coped with disasters, he has learned that the biggest mistake parents made was to try to protect their children. ''Parents talk too little about what kids see and experience,'' he said. ''Also, parents are of course coping with their own struggles and don't want to acknowledge or are reluctant to acknowledge the extent of the destruction.'' But Dr. Lifton also said that it was worse for children when parents evaded the subject than when they talked openly about the frightening events.
Dr. Breitner emphasized, however, that his study ''does not rise to the level of evidence that would warrant physicians prescribing hormone therapy for this indication or for women to start using it for this indication.'' Dr. Bill Thies, the vice president for medical and scientific affairs at the Alzheimer's Association, agreed. ''Any effect of estrogen on cognitive functioning is not well enough established to make that the determining factor,'' Dr. Thies said. The new paper, published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, comes on the heels of a major reassessment of postmenopausal hormone therapy. In the 1990's, many doctors told women to start taking hormones at menopause and to continue for the rest of their lives to protect their health. But in July, a large federal study reported that hormone therapy involving estrogen and progestin had slight risks -- of heart attacks, stroke, blood clots and breast cancer -- that were not balanced by its slight benefits, a small reduction in bone fractures and in colon cancer. In response, leading medical groups said healthy women should not use hormone therapy except to relieve disabling symptoms of menopause, like severe hot flashes.
Scientists believe humans have hundreds of thousands of these genetic variations, and drug companies are avidly searching for them, convinced that they can use collections of them to identify patients who will benefit from drugs, patients who will not, and patients who will suffer troubling side effects. Eventually, they say, this research will lead them into an era of tailor-made medicine. So far, testing for such genetic variants is being done only at a few medical centers as part of experimental trials. Experts predict a gradual increase in such testing as the roster of variations is compiled and research accelerates. They predict that the first personalized drug prescriptions will appear in a few years and many more will roll out over the next two decades. At first, the advanced genetic testing will probably be used for refining drugs for the more common diseases like asthma, arthritis, heart disease, high blood pressure and migraines. Eventually, experts say, it could be applied to virtually any drug for any disease.
That, he added, was not necessarily expected. ''My own feeling was that children are very impressionable and that this is the way they learn -- by watching others,'' Dr. Eron said. ''I did not know it would affect people later in their development.'' Dr. Dale Kunkel, a professor of communications at the University of California at Santa Barbara, said the new study ''is another rock on an already huge pile of evidence documenting the relationship between media violence and real-world violence and aggression.'' Dr. Johnson said the results had important implications for society. ''By decreasing exposure to media violence, we may be able to prevent millions of Americans from being raped and murdered,'' he said in an interview this week. Dr. Steven Goodman, a statistician at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said studies that look for associations are beset with formidable obstacles, especially if they were originally designed to answer other questions. In can be impossible to know whether there were other factors besides television watching that distinguished the less violent children from those who were more violent. These concerns are particularly worrisome, Dr. Goodman added, when a study finds such a weak effect.
Dr. Nelson is an exception, Dr. Meier said. More often, she said, doctors tell a family that the patient will starve to death without a feeding tube, and pressure them to have it put in. Her own view, she said, is that ''families should be counseled that loss of an ability to eat and drink is a sign that the patient has entered the terminal phase of the illness'' and the focus should be on palliative care. No one can say for sure whether a feeding tube prolongs life, Dr. Meier said, but ''it's counterintuitive to think it won't.'' Mrs. Mull had her feeding tube for about four years, until she started to regurgitate food with episodes of choking and coughing. Mrs. Hollar spoke to her sister and brothers. ''I said I don't want to put her through any more discomfort,'' she recalled. ''It is time to let her go.''
Or perhaps, Dr. Dominko thought, the problem was simply in the very first step in cloning, the mechanical injury of removing the DNA from an egg. She designed an experiment. She would take the DNA out of an egg as if she were to do cloning. But then she would put it back and fertilize the egg and see if it developed normally. The results, she said, were the same sorts of grossly abnormal embryos that she saw with cloning. But when she tested other steps in cloning they, too, created deformed embryos. ''The process is so complex that there is not one variable that makes or breaks it,' Dr. Dominko said. ''That is what is so frustrating about dissecting this thing in primates -- it will never be feasible. You would need a whole primate colony with thousands of animals. How many questions can you ask on a single egg? One. If you are lucky, you ask the right one.''
''You always get what you pay for,'' Dr. Rubin said. Several years after President Clinton's failed effort to remake health care in America, the health care market is remaking itself. For those with insurance or the money to pay for health care, there is evolving a two-tiered system. One tier is made up of doctors who have cut their prices at the insistence of health insurers and who make up for the reduced prices by increasing their volume, seeing more patients per hour. The other tier is made up of those like Dr. Rubin who offer time and attention -- but at a cost. While there are no national figures on how many doctors are joining the new tier, health care experts agreed that all of a sudden, doctors who never before dared to abandon health insurance plans were taking the plunge. They are a different breed from the growing ranks of doctors who are focusing their practices on cosmetic procedures, like laser eye surgery or liposuction, that patients pay for out of their own pockets. Instead, these are doctors like family practitioners and internists who provide basic medical care as well as specialists, like general surgeons, gastroenterologists, psychiatrists and psychologists, and cardiologists, who take care of serious medical problems. These renegade doctors tend to be in urban areas, where managed care has made the greatest inroads, the doctors said.
A few new journals have begun soliciting and publishing negative studies -- ostensibly to prevent repetition and waste, and to acknowledge that even negative results add value to our collective knowledge bank. It's a tough sell. The tendency for science to overlook most of the vast backwash of failed experiments isn't accidental. Money, pride, politics and good old competition all play a role. And even when major negative studies are published, it may not have the effect of moving researchers on to other topics. For Dr. Bjorn Olsen, a professor of cell biology at Harvard Medical School, the solution to the problem of small negative studies is clear. He is setting up the Journal of the Negative Results in Biomedicine, which is expected to be online this summer. ''You have a hypothesis, based on what is commonly accepted in an area,'' Dr. Olsen said. ''You do some experiments and it doesn't work out that way. Frequently, there is something wrong with what everyone assumes is true.''
Previously, doctors were advised to prescribe statins to moderately high risk patients only if the patients' L.D.L. levels were above 130, and the treatment was considered effective if L.D.L. levels fell below 130. For example, following the new advice, a 57-year-old nonsmoking man who has an L.D.L. of 115 and whose blood pressure, with medication, is 130, could now receive drug treatment. Under the old rules, he would not have been treated. The recommendations also call for more aggressive treatment of people at high risk, that is, with established heart disease, diabetes, or other conditions that give them a greater than 20 percent chance of having a heart attack in the next decade. In such cases, when L.D.L. levels are above 100, doctors should always recommend drug treatment, the report said, and no longer have the option of not prescribing the medications. The previous advice said that drug treatment was imperative in high risk people only when their L.D.L. exceeded 130.
No one is advocating that false or inaccurate claims be permitted. But agency officials are asking questions like whether they can continue to prevent food companies from making health claims for their products and whether they can continue to insist that drug advertising include a full accounting of side effects and conditions that may make the drug inadvisable. The review began with a notice in The Federal Register on May 16 inviting interested parties to comment on ''First Amendment issues.'' Hundreds replied, with wish lists, cries of alarm, hefty documents from drug company lawyers and notes from consumers who want the agency to take all shackles off the supplement industry. The comment period ended on Sept. 13, and those who wish to respond to comments have until Oct. 28. Over the next few months the agency will review the comments and decide what changes, if any, to propose in its regulations. It also expects to get a new commissioner, Dr. Mark B. McClellan, who was nominated by President Bush late last month and seems headed for a speedy confirmation. ''No decision will be made without his involvement and approval,'' said Daniel Troy, the agency's chief counsel.
Even Dr. McPherson hedged a bit. ''Maybe this guy really wants to be at that university,'' he said. ''There are ways to work with the devil. It all comes down to a value judgment.''
The same arguments were made by the American College of Radiology and the Food and Drug Administration. Radiologists at scanning centers protested. It may not be proven that scans save lives, but on the whole, they said, the benefit of finding something like cancer early outweighs the problem of finding harmless nodules and having additional tests to rule out disease. But that is not how the scans were portrayed by professional societies, the scanning center doctors say. ''We were perceived as charlatans, bilking the population,'' Dr. Brant-Zawadzki said. He was chagrined, he said. ''Did I see it coming?'' Dr. Brant-Zawadzki asked. ''No, obviously, I didn't.'' Dr. Edmund Lundy, director of the Health Test Scan Center in Boca Raton, says his center is one of the few in his area still in business. The trick, he said, is to market to doctors, persuading them to send him patients. When doctors do the referring for diagnostic purposes, health insurance often pays, he adds.
The research was financed by the government of South Korea, where cloning to create a baby is illegal. Dr. Hwang is an expert in animal cloning, and Dr. Moon is a medical doctor who trained in the late 1980's at a leading American fertility center, the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk. That is one of the very few places where researchers have extracted human stem cells from embryos that were made the usual way, by using sperm to fertilize eggs. Until now, no one had even come close to using cloning to create a human embryo or even a monkey embryo, to say nothing of extracting stem cells from one. Stem cells are the research prize. They appear after an embryo has grown for five or six days, its cells subdividing within the hard casing of the egg. Although the embryo at this stage contains about 100 cells, it is still no bigger than the original egg, nearly invisible to the naked eye.
''I started looking around,'' Dr. Toppenberg said. ''The newer systems tended to be about $15,000 per doctor, not counting the ongoing support fees. Then I found out that the Vista system was available. You just have to figure out how to get it to work.'' He did -- but it took him six months. Anyone who wants the new Vista, which is expected to require far fewer steps to install than the V.A.'s version, must wait until August. Some, like Dr. Meyer Cohen, an internist in Boca Raton, Fla., want to see how it works before committing time and money to it. But a few, like Dr. Ismet B. Kursunoglu, director of the Alaska Clinic in Wasilla, Alaska, cannot wait. ''There are a lot of fantastic vendors,'' Dr. Kursunoglu said, ''but, realistically, we're in a time period where reimbursement is going down and costs are rising. This is free.'' ''This,'' he said, ''is a fantastic opportunity.''
Now, with disputes and reviews under way, it is by no means certain what the final, official consensus on obesity deaths will turn out to be. The correction to the original article may be just the beginning as the agency has now asked for outside advice on how to do the calculations. In response, said Dr. Dixie Snider, the chief scientist at the centers, the Institute of Medicine will have a meeting next month to discuss the appropriate statistical methodology to calculate obesity deaths. ''One of the things we're trying to do is not to come up with any one person's favorite method,'' Dr. Snider said. But Dr. Snider insisted that the paper in question was actually of only minor importance in the nation's fight against fat. ''We regret that we published a number that in retrospect was incorrect,'' Dr. Snider said. ''And we regret the confusion. But the underlying message does not change. The paper makes clear and the erratum makes clear that tobacco and obesity are the two biggest killers.''
Longer life. Less disease. Less disability. The trends have continued for more than a century as humans have become bigger, stronger and healthier. But can they -- will they -- keep going? Or is there some countertrend, obesity or an overuse of medications, perhaps, that will turn the statistics around? The questions are serious, but, researchers say, for now there are no easy answers, only lessons in humility as, over and over again in recent years, scientists have seen their best predictions overthrown. Life expectancy, for example, has been a real surprise, says Eileen M. Crimmins, a professor of gerontology and demographic research at the University of Southern California. ''When I came of age as a professional, 25 years ago, basically the idea was three score years and 10 is what you get,'' Dr. Crimmins said. Life span was ''this rock, and you can't touch it.'' ''But,'' she added, ''then we started noticing that in fact mortality is plummeting.''
About 35 percent of families lose all or most of their life savings in the course of caring for the person who's dying. And I believe that the poor state of prognostic knowledge and prognostic practice is a factor that is contributing to these bad outcomes. If patients and doctors knew that the patient was dying, they might institute interventions like stopping painful treatment, like having better financial planning that would maybe mitigate some of those bad outcomes.  Q. Do doctors know a patient's prognosis and avoid telling it, or do doctors themselves not know what a patient's prognosis is?  A. There is an absence and avoidance of prognosis in the profession. Less than a quarter of textbook entries have any information about prognosis, and only 4 percent of published research is on prognosis.  Q. How well do doctors do in predicting a patient's outcome?  A. I just published a study a few months ago in The British Medical Journal in which we looked at physicians' prognoses in 500 terminally ill patients. We found that with a very liberal standard of accuracy only 20 percent of the prognoses were accurate. On average, physicians overestimate survival by a factor of 5.3 And this is not what they told the patients; it's what they told us. They'd say, ''I think this patient is going to live for four months.'' And they died within a week.  Q. Why would doctors want to overestimate the effectiveness of treatments? Wouldn't they get discouraged seeing patient after patient fail to respond?  A. In a way their miscalibrated optimism is all about doctors' giving themselves hope. They want to believe that their treatments are better than they are.  Q. What are the consequences for dying patients and their families when doctors are too optimistic?  A. They reassure loved ones that, ''Oh no. It's not time for your relatives to fly in from California. You're not dying yet.'' And then the patient dies. Or they say, ''Oh, you're going to live a year or two years.'' And then the patients don't make their wills and they die the next week.
Still, when women reach 50, the therapy should be re-evaluated. ''Then you have to open up the dialogues as if they're menopausal,'' Dr. Schiff said. Many women who wrote to Dr. Hays asked about other treatments for the symptoms of menopause, like estrogen creams, estrogen patches or vaginal rings containing estrogen. Some also asked about other drugs or supplements, including soy and herbs like black cohosh. But Dr. Hays said she was cautious about recommending any of those remedies. She said some doctors told women that an estrogen patch was safer because the hormone bypassed the liver, making blood clots less likely. While plausible, she said, that hypothesis has not been proved. As for creams and ''natural estrogen'' formulations, Dr. Hays refers women to the Food and Drug Administration's warning that in the absence of studies demonstrating that such options are safer than estrogen, their safety cannot be assumed. Alternatives like supplements and antidepressant drugs, which are said to relieve menopause symptoms, are even more problematic, Dr. Hays said. Little is known about their effectiveness. In the case of supplements, she added, nothing is known about long-term effects.
''Yes, it was a big deal,'' Dr. Mack said. ''But I wouldn't have done it if I didn't think it was going to work.'' The robots are approved for marketing in Germany (in the United States they cannot be approved until the testing is complete), and surgeons there and elsewhere in Europe are learning to use them. Like Dr. Mack, the other doctors using robots in the clinical trials in the United States go to Germany, where they do entire bypass operations with robots. The procedure is still limited. In order to use a robot to bypass more than one blockage in a coronary artery, to avoid using a heart-lung machine and to work on an artery other than the one at the front of the heart, scientists have to figure out methods of getting at the sides and the back of a beating heart. If they do not split open the chest, there is very little room to maneuver, even for a robot's tiny fingers and slender arms.
In stock trading yesterday, shares of Bristol-Myers were down 33 cents, to $27.90, and those of Pfizer were up 34 cents, to $37.51. Pfizer's vice president for cardiovascular products in the United States, Dr. Gary Palmer, said the results ''are fantastic news'' for patients like those in the study ''and a reminder of how good a drug Lipitor is.'' At Bristol-Myers Squibb, Dr. Andrew G. Bodnar, senior vice president for strategy and medical and external affairs, said, ''I think we were all surprised.'' But, Dr. Bodnar said, ''it's really, really important information.'' He emphasized that all patients involved in the study had been hospitalized because plaque in a coronary artery had ruptured. When that happens, blood clots form and block blood flow to the heart. The result is sudden crushing chest pain. Dr. Bodnar added that it was hard to imagine that just lowering L.D.L. levels could start making a difference within a month.
A new study in a British medical journal has stirred a passionate debate among doctors in Europe and the United States by asserting that mammograms do not prevent women from dying of breast cancer or help them avoid mastectomies. The question is dividing experts and women's health advocates, many of whom acknowledge that they do not know what to think about the new report. For more than two decades, annual mammograms have been part of life for millions of women, with the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute urging women to have them. Experts are still digesting the new findings, which appeared in the Oct. 20 issue of the journal The Lancet, and few if any authorities in the United States are suggesting that women abandon routine mammography on the basis of this study. Women have long been urged to have the test every year starting at age 50 or sooner, and promised that early detection will reduce their chances of dying from breast cancer by about 30 percent. And detecting cancer early, they were told, would allow women to avoid extensive surgery and harsh treatments that might be needed to control a larger tumor found later.
''There was an increasing body of knowledge to suggest that the cardiopulmonary bypass machine was not a completely benign device,'' said Dr. David C. Charlesworth, a senior cardiac surgeon who is the president of the medical staff at the Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, N.H. A small percentage of patients would have strokes, Dr. Charlesworth said. But with many more, the problems were subtle like social problems, personality changes and spotty memories. Often, the problems cleared up, but in 30 percent of patients they did not. It made sense, surgeons thought, that the bypass machine could cause problems. Doctors clamp blood vessels closed, preventing them from flooding the heart with blood, and inject an icy cold solution in the heart, almost freezing the tissue. They redirect the blood through tubes that can cause injury, creating little bubbles in the blood or tiny fragments of debris that can hurt the brain.
''If you were my doctor, would you continue the therapy I am currently taking when you consider my age?'' one woman asked. In the debates over hormone therapy, younger patients who have had hysterectomies are in a sense the forgotten women. Yet their numbers are huge: a million or more American women under 50 are taking Premarin, the most popular estrogen pill, according to Wyeth Inc., its manufacturer. And the advice doctors have to offer them is uncertain. For six decades, estrogen has been the treatment of choice for such women. Because their uteruses have been removed, they can take the hormone by itself without fear of developing cancer of the uterine lining, which has been linked to estrogen therapy. Women who have not had hysterectomies are given a combination of estrogen and progestin to protect them from uterine cancer. The estrogen study halted last week, part of the Women's Health Initiative, found that the hormone offered no protection from heart attacks and slightly raised the risk for stroke and possibly dementia. In 2002, another study, examining combination hormone therapy, was stopped when researchers found that the hormones slightly increased the risk of breast cancer.
In its experiment, the company replaced the genetic material of a human egg with that from adult cells, in this case either skin cells or cumulus cells, which are cells that cling to human eggs and that might be more amenable than skin cells for cloning. The researchers started with 19 eggs, adding skin cell genetic material to 11 and cumulus cell genetic material to the rest. The eggs with skin cell genetic material died before they could even divide a single time. Three of the eight eggs with cumulus cells divided once or twice before dying. It was impossible to retrieve stem cells. An embryo would have to grow for about five days and, more important, from a ball of cells into a vesicle with two cell types. One type makes up the outer wall and the other type clusters inside and consists of embryonic stem cells. The second method was to stimulate an egg to divide without being fertilized. Any embryos that might result from this process, known as parthenogenesis, would have only the genes of the egg cell. But they  cannot develop into babies -- genes from a male are needed to form a functioning placenta. Dr. Michael D. West, the company's chief executive and an author of its paper, said that since the embryos had no hope of developing fully anyway, he hoped there would be no ethical objections to destroying them to get stem cells.
In fact, he has concluded, the prevailing wisdom was based on a misinterpretation. Archimedes was not trying to piece together strips of paper into different shapes; he was trying to see how many ways the 14 irregular strips could be put together to make a square. The answer -- 17,152 -- required a careful and systematic counting of all possibilities. ''It was hard,'' said Dr. Persi Diaconis, a Stanford statistician who worked on it along with a colleague, Dr. Susan Holmes, who is also his wife, and a second husband-and-wife team of combinatorial mathematicians, Dr. Ronald Graham and Dr. Fan Chung from the University of California, San Diego. Independently, a computer scientist, Dr. William H. Cutler at Chicago Rawhide, a manufacturer of oil seals in Elgin, Ill., wrote a program that confirmed that the mathematicians' answer was correct. Perhaps as remarkable as the discovery that Archimedes knew combinatorics is the story of a manuscript that dates to 975, written in Greek on parchment. It is one of three sets of copies of Archimedes' works that were available in the Middle Ages. (The others are lost, and neither contained the Stomachion.)
The reasons, she and others are finding, seem to have a lot to do with conditions early in life. Poor nutrition in early years is associated with short stature and lifelong ill health, and until recently, food was expensive in the United States and Europe. Dr. Fogel and Dr. Costa looked at data on height and body mass index among Union Army veterans who were 65 and older in 1910 and veterans of World War II who were that age in the 1980's. Their data relating size to health led them to a prediction: the World War II veterans should have had 35 percent less chronic disease than the Union Army veterans. That, they said, is exactly what happened. They also found that diseases early in life left people predisposed to chronic illnesses when they grew older. ''Suppose you were a survivor of typhoid or tuberculosis,'' Dr. Fogel said. ''What would that do to aging?'' It turned out, he said, that the number of chronic illnesses at age 50 was much higher in that group. ''Something is being undermined,'' he said. ''Even the cancer rates were higher. Ye gods. We never would have suspected that.''
Those who have examined the results of open access say that the system worked as well elsewhere as it did in the California clinic. One of the first to try it was the clinic in Anchorage, which provides medical care for more than 20,000 patients. It took months to clear out the patient backlogs, but now, the clinic administrators said, the system is working just as Dr. Murray promised. The only problem came at first, when patients simply could not believe the new guarantee that they could get an appointment with their doctor on the day they called. Many were calling and making an appointment just to see if they could. ''There was this period of, 'I don't believe it, I'm going to try it again,'' said Michelle Tierney, health systems administrator for the Anchorage clinic. For Dr. Douglas Eby, who is vice president of medical services for the Southcentral Foundation, which manages the medical clinic , the real proof of success is in the data. Visits to the clinic for urgent care have dropped by nearly 50 percent, he said. Many more patients are getting preventive care -- the number of mammograms and Pap tests has tripled. And the number of patients who failed to show up for their appointments has fallen to less than 10 percent from 23 percent.
Cancer researchers say there is a great need for studies focusing on the elderly. The typical cancer patient is not a parent with school-age children, but a grandmother or grandfather living alone or in a nursing home. For example, while a woman of 35 has a 1 in 2,500 risk of developing breast cancer in the next year, a 75-year-old woman's risk is closer to 1 in 300, noted Dr. Hyman Muss, a professor of medicine at the University of Vermont. ''With the aging of our population, the average cancer patient is going to be 70 years old,'' said Dr. Bruce Chabner, the clinical director of the cancer center at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ''But the average patient in clinical trials is 45 or 50.'' Younger patients often want, and can tolerate, extremely aggressive treatments. With decades of life before them, they have every incentive to go to any length to try to wipe their cancers out. That was why many sought bone marrow transplants, a regimen that used doses of poisonous chemotherapy drugs so high that only the youngest and healthiest patients could survive them. It was not a suitable treatment for an 80-year-old woman with heart disease or kidney disease or emphysema. Nor was it in demand among the elderly.
Alzheimer's disease can seem unrelentingly grim. There is no cure, no known way to prevent the illness, and the benefits of current treatments are modest at best. But in laboratories around the country, scientists are uncovering clues that may eventually -- perhaps even in the next two decades -- allow them to prevent, slow or even reverse the ruthless progression of the illness. ''Things are more hopeful than perhaps people think,'' Dr. Karen Duff of the Nathan Kline Institute of New York University said. ''We are on the cusp of having something really useful.'' That hope comes on the heels of disappointment. Aricept and other drugs to slow the disease's progress have not lived up to the public's high expectations. But researchers are now turning in a new direction, testing whether other medications, some already on the market for other disorders, might head off Alzheimer's or keep it from becoming worse by acting on possible risk factors for the illness.
''We will see a big hunt for the original host,'' Dr. Holmes said. Researchers are set to take blood from birds and mammals in southeastern China, where the epidemic began, and look for SARS antibodies. Then they will try to isolate the virus, which may prove difficult. Most coronaviruses won't grow in the lab. One group, the human coronaviruses type 2, when first isolated, would only grow in cultures of the human fetal tracheal organ, Dr. Holmes said. The SARS virus is unusual in this respect; it is readily isolated from patients and grows in standard laboratory cells -- which should allow scientists to isolate it from animals that harbor it. Dr. Holmes, for one, is delighted. ''That is wonderful. It is a gift from God,'' she said. ''Otherwise, we would still be trying to figure out what it is.'' Fever Pitch
The issue is especially difficult for small companies, like Dr. Lange's, that as yet have no products on the market. Dr. Lange says he is torn. CV Therapeutics, he noted, is a business, not a charity. It cannot afford to set up a marketing system in countries where few can buy the drug, or a distribution system to give its drugs away. ''We're not Merck,'' he said. ''But we are concerned.'' There is no question that the patients who participated in the company's studies are needy. Chronic angina has made their lives miserable. Terrifying, crushing chest pains can come on without warning and often persist despite bypass surgery, angioplasty and medications. Ranolazine can make a difference. It changes the heart's metabolism, allowing it to operate more efficiently. The company's studies found that it can cut the frequency of angina attacks nearly in half. The Food and Drug Administration has told CV Therapeutics that the drug is ''approvable,'' if it can provide a bit more data. On Jan. 21, The Journal of the American Medical Association published the company's study along with a laudatory editorial, reporting that ranolazine helped patients whose angina was crippling despite standard therapies.
''They will have to understand that we are in a research mode for at least the next year,'' he said. ''They will have to be patient and realize that they would be expected to bear some of the research costs.'' Mr. Hawthorne said he could not estimate what cat cloning would cost. Cloning experts say that if their experience is any guide, Genetic Savings and Clone will not lack for interested pet owners. Dr. George Seidel, a cloning researcher at Colorado State University, said he had heard from many interested pet owners, though he could not help them. He said he remembered one woman who called him about her cat, named Stinky. ''Stinky had died, and she had put it in her freezer three weeks earlier,'' Dr. Seidel recalled. ''She asked me what we could do. I said, 'I don't think you've got any hope there. Take Stinky out of the freezer and bury it.' ''
But some are asking whether the neuroblastoma case is the exception or the rule. That is a conundrum that hinges on an emerging and startling view of the very nature of cancer. Over the last few years, investigators have found more and more hints that cancer is not what they always thought it was. The traditional view was that cancerous cells looked aberrant under a microscope, grew in an uncontrolled fashion and, in most cases, killed. Now, though, researchers understand that some cancers are indolent -- so indolent, in fact, that they will never grow large enough in the patient's lifetime to cause medical problems. Still others look like cancers under the microscope and have growth patterns in the lab that are typical of deadly tumors but can stop growing on their own and revert to normal tissue. At the same time, there are more screening tests, and they are increasingly sensitive, finding cancers at earlier stages. That leaves doctors with a problem. The earlier they detect cells that look cancerous, the less certain they can be of how dangerous they are.
He prescribed indomethacin, an anti-inflammatory drug that often makes such tumors shrink. Two years later, in July 1980, the woman began to complain that the drug upset her stomach, so Dr. Waddell switched her prescription to another anti-inflammatory drug, sulindac. To his amazement, the drug seemed to make the tumors disappear. Dr. Waddell decided to prescribe the drug for three of the woman's relatives who also had the disease.  One was a 21-year-old man whose colon had been removed but who had 15 polyps in his rectum. Within a year, he had none. Another, a 42-year-old man, had 50 polyps in his colon when he began taking the drug. A year later, he had four very small polyps. A 16-year-old girl had 25 polyps in her colon. A year later she had three small ones. Dr. Waddell thought he had stumbled upon something amazing, but  few of his colleagues believed him and major medical journals rejected his findings. He finally published them in The Journal of Surgical Oncology in 1983. ''No one paid any attention to that paper,'' Dr. Waddell said.
EVERY winter, the flu appears, a commonplace plague that kills tens of thousands a year in the United States alone, and deposits many thousands more in bed for a week, racked with muscle pain and headache, burning with fever. But modern science understands how flu spreads, and it has vaccines to protect against it. So, increasingly, scientists are asking: Why must we endure an epidemic every year? The answer, said Dr. M. Elizabeth Halloran, a statistician at Emory University, is, ''Maybe we don't.'' If the scientists are right, flu could be changed from an infectious disease that sweeps the country into one that afflicts relatively few people, more of a nuisance than a scourge. Conquering a disease so common and so ancient that it is not clear where its name came from would be an epochal achievement. (One theory on the name is that it derives from 18th-century Italy, where sufferers began calling their illness ''influenza di freddo,'' or influence of the cold, since the bug always seemed to arrive in winter.)
''These are exciting preliminary results,'' Dr. Lanza said. The company's scientists also wrote a paper for Scientific American, which appears on its Web site today, called ''The First Human Cloned Embryo.'' ''After months of trying, on Oct. 13, 2001, we came into our laboratory at Advanced Cell Technology to see under the microscope what we'd been striving for -- little balls of cells not even visible to the naked eye,'' the scientists wrote. ''Insignificant as they appeared, the specks were precious because they were, to our knowledge, the first human embryos produced by the technique of nuclear transplantation, otherwise known as cloning.'' The paper goes on to say these embryos died. But then the article returns to the promise of the method.
Has the fat fever broken? Don't count on it. After an article in a leading medical journal reported last week that people who are overweight, but not obese, have a lower risk of death than normal-size and skinny people, it might seem that pleasingly plump could finally become the socially accepted norm. But even the Centers for Disease Control, whose researchers helped conduct the journal study, continue to say that fighting fat remains a top public health priority. And some social critics and medical researchers say that because there are so many groups with an entrenched interest in crusading against fat it is unlikely that the obesity epidemic will be declared over anytime soon. ''The operative term is moral panic,'' said Dr. Sander Gilman, a professor of liberal arts and science at Emory University. ''There are moments when certain things become the focus of the society because they are believed to be a danger to the society. And it is believed that if you focus on it you will be able to avoid it or cure it.''
Yet cancer prevention trials take years and involve healthy people, magnifying the risk that some drug dangers will emerge, scientists say. ''If you are talking about treating otherwise healthy people for years and years and years with drugs, it is almost impossible to be sure that in some relatively small fraction of patients, there won't be side effects, even severe side effects,'' said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a colon cancer researcher and Howard Hughes investigator at Johns Hopkins University. Now, Pfizer and Merck have seen what the consequences can be. ''I hope it doesn't prevent companies from trying to develop anti-cancer drugs,'' Dr. Vogelstein said. ''But I fear it will.'' Celebrex is known to prevent polyps in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, a genetic condition that makes it inevitable that one day they will get colon cancer. But even these patients are asking their doctors it they should still take Celebrex. Or should they give it to their children, who inherited the condition?
But for people who are worried about ending their days bent over with the disease, or with a broken hip in a nursing home, Dr. Carmona has a message. ''You don't have to be a hunched over old lady or old man,'' he said. ''If you pay attention to bone health.''
''Our I.R.B. felt that it was unethical to offer an inferior method if a superior method is available,'' Dr. Gleicher said, referring to the institutional review board, an ethics committee. But Dr. Schoolcraft said he saw a real difference between the two methods. ''With sperm sorting, you are not throwing away potential babies,'' he said. Like Dr. Grifo, he worried about the future of his field. ''We have a responsibility to be conservative and cautious,'' Dr. Schoolcraft said. ''It's our responsibility not to misuse these technologies.''
In an editorial accompanying Dr. Partridge's paper, Dr. Vaupel, Dr. James R. Carey, a biodemographer at the University of California at Davis, and Dr. Kaare Christensen, a professor of genetic epidemiology at the University of Southern Denmark, wrote that the message was that ''for most species, aging is so remarkably pliable that interventions do not have to be lifelong.'' ''It's an encouraging message, even edifying,'' Dr. Vaupel said in a telephone interview. Of course, he added, not every bit of damage to the body can be erased. ''If you have a heart attack, permanent damage is done.,'' he said. ''If you've had a detached retina, your vision is never going to be the same. But this doesn't mean there is nothing that can be done about old age. Even though there are some things you can't do anything about, current conditions are surprisingly important and more important than the legacy of all the bad things that have happened to you.''
''We are very happy and the families are very happy,'' Dr. Fischer said. ''It is a success today. Then the next question is, 'How long will it be a success?' It may be that after some time there will be a decline in these cells and that sooner or later we will have to treat them again. We hope that if this happens it will not be for a very long time.'' Gene therapy experts were exuberant. ''It's a very exciting study,'' said Dr. R. Michael Blaese, who was a member of a medical team at the National Institutes of Health that tried the first gene therapy on a human patient nearly 10 years ago. Dr. Blaese, now the head of the human therapeutics division at ValiGen in Newtown, Pa., added: ''This would probably be the first example in any disease where gene therapy could be a fully successful treatment. You can't distinguish these patients from normal.''
''All I have to tell them is that I'm on the shared care plan,'' Mr. Littlefield said, referring to the name of the electronic record. ''There's no more questions asked.'' But there is a catch. When, as with the Whatcom County program, medical care is improved, and money saved, there are winners: in this case, insurers, including Medicare, which could save millions, and pharmaceutical companies. And there are losers: general practitioners and hospitals, with each doctor standing to lose at least $2,000 a year, according to projections, and some doctors reporting that their costs are already much higher. The program, which is considered a model for how health care can be improved, so far involves patients with just two diseases: diabetes and congestive heart failure. And though the organizers hoped to get doctors excited enough to make financial sacrifices to join, they were not entirely successful. Many did enlist, but one group of 60 doctors, the Madrona Medical Group of Bellingham, took part in the planning but chose not to participate in the program.
The success comes on the heels of a tumultuous decade in which, according to the National Institutes of Health, more than 390 gene therapy studies were initiated, involving more than 4,000 patients and more than a dozen medical conditions. While those doing the research always expressed confidence in its promise, critics said many of the companies formed to capitalize on the technology exaggerated preliminary data in the hope of raising capital. And, at times, some scientists promised more than the technology was ready to deliver, leaving the field a target for accusations that patients were being endangered by reckless experiments that were doomed to failure. ''We've all been so burned by saying, 'Ah, this looks like it worked, that looks like it worked,' '' said Dr. W. French Anderson of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California and a member of the team that attempted the first gene therapy in 1990. ''Now when it finally looks like something is working, I don't want to be in the position of saying the same words. We've all been criticized for hyping too much.''
Even if a cancer is found, patients may not be helped, said Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, an expert on early diagnosis at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt. Cancers do not always spread and cause harm; most simply stay small and inconsequential, but no one knows which early cancer is dangerous and which is not. And no one knows whether operating on early cancers saves lives or whether the deadly cancers have already spread by the time they are found. By incidentally scanning the lungs of symptomless people, Dr. Welch said, doctors will find these small spots, frighten many patients and lead many to have biopsies and other procedures for tiny, harmless lumps. ''We can cause more problems than we can solve,'' Dr. Welch said. Yet researchers say the new heart scans also hold immense promise. ''This is a technology that has the potential to revolutionize the way we practice cardiology in this country,'' said Dr. Joao Lima, a cardiovascular imaging specialist at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
The committee urged that women who have implants be tracked so investigators can get reliable data on the incidence of medical complications like rupture, scarring and infection. Such information ''is an essential part of the informed consent process,'' the group said. But the committee was insistent about what it described as its ''very firm conclusions'' on the diseases that some women and doctors have said were caused by implants -- a list that includes cancer, connective tissue diseases like arthritis and lupus, neurological problems, a new disease characterized by symptoms like fatigue and muscle aches and pains and diseases in the children of women with implants. These were the diseases at the heart of the multibillion-dollar product liability litigation over breast implants. Dr. Bondurant said that the group concluded that ''women with implants are no more likely than other women to develop these systemic illnesses.'' More than 60 women with implants testified before the committee in a public hearing and hundreds more wrote letters telling of the severe medical problems they had suffered since having their implants.
In their analysis, the investigators used a statistical model to take into account other factors, like poverty, childhood neglect and the presence of a psychiatric disorder, that have been linked to violence. Still, they said, there was a link between television watching and aggressive or violent behavior in boys, but nothing significant in girls. Studies, arguments and concern about the effects of television and televised violence date from 1946, when television sets began to come into use in American homes. In 1972, the United States surgeon general wrote that ''televised violence, indeed, does have an adverse effect on certain members of our society.'' Over the years, a variety of professional groups, including the American Psychological Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, have issued similar statements. But now, said Dr. Leonard Eron, a psychology professor at the University of Michigan and a pioneer in the study of television's effects on behavior, ''this shows that adolescents and young adults are also affected.''
One story begins with a drug that was wholly abandoned: bucindolol, a once-promising treatment for heart failure. Bucindolol, one in a class of drugs known as beta blockers, was tested in a large study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the Department of Veterans Affairs. But the clinical trial was halted early after research on other beta blockers found that those drugs improved survival for most heart failure patients. The researchers studying bucindolol felt that, given these findings, it would have been unethical to continue the study because it meant giving some patients a placebo. Soon, bucindolol was all but forgotten. But even if beta blockers help most heart failure patients, they do not help all, and Dr. Stephen Liggett, who researches heart failure at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, wanted to understand why. Heart failure affects more than five million Americans, and it is a dire illness. It takes six months to a year of beta blocker treatment before it is clear whether the drugs are helping. With heart failure, Dr. Liggett says, a year is too long to wait.
''People talk as if the stopping of dying from heart disease is always a good thing,'' said Dr. Joanne Lynn, who directs the Washington Home Center for Palliative Care Studies. ''It is as if just extending life is always terrific,'' Dr. Lynn said. ''That may be true if you are talking about a heart attack in a 45-year-old man, but if you are talking about an 85-year-old man, what is often left is frailty and dementia. Is it worth it? At the very least we ought to know what we are doing.'' Dr. Thomas Pearson, a professor of community and preventive medicine at the University of Rochester, agreed. ''People think, 'Death rates are going down; everything's fine,' '' Dr. Pearson said. ''Everything is not fine. We call it the endgame of the cardiovascular disease epidemic.'' The plunging death rates have come about for an array of reasons -- new drugs, new treatments, changes in behavior. No single change has made a huge difference, but the incremental advances have added up.
''Even if you clone vats of these cells, if you don't change the environment of the host, they won't do their job,'' Dr. Faustman said. But the work also provides new hope for medicine, researchers said. In an editorial accompanying Dr. Anversa's recent paper, two editors from The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Robert S. Schwartz and Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, noted that the findings had enormous implications. They ''raise the hope that counter to traditional beliefs, the heart can repair itself,'' they wrote. That means, they said, that scientists may be able to prompt that repair. They believe that is not such an impossible aim. ''Such approaches to therapy,'' they wrote, ''which previously were only pipe dreams, are now realistic goals that may soon be within reach.''
Such drugs are already available. One group, alpha-2 agonists, suppress the activity of the first variant gene and another, beta-blockers, block the locking mechanism on the heart cells. Now, when doctors prescribe those drugs for heart-failure patients, only about half respond. The new study raises the possibility that the responders may be patients with the altered genes. While that hypothesis must be tested, Dr. Bristow said, the data ''strongly suggests'' it. Dr. Roger J. Hajjar, a cardiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who wrote an editorial accompanying Dr. Liggett's paper, said he knew of several research papers, as yet unpublished, confirming its conclusions. ''There's some very strong evidence that what they have unraveled is true,'' he said in an interview. ''There's definitely a lot of excitement.'' Dr. Liggett suggests it might make sense to offer genetic testing to relatives of heart-failure patients who have the altered genes. ''The absolute first take-home message is that we can identify early on people who are genetically programmed to have a higher risk of heart failure,'' he said. ''The question is, What could you do about that? The most sensible thing would be to lower to zero all the other risk factors. High blood pressure -- you have to have perfect blood pressure control. Diabetes -- you can't have diabetes. Smoking -- absolutely not. High cholesterol -- absolutely not. Obesity and low physical activity -- you can't have that.''
Rabbi Joy Levitt, the associate executive director for program at the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan, said she offered parents a few concrete suggestions. ''I think that children can be encouraged to write letters to the firefighters, thanking them for their bravery,'' she said. ''My kids saw me go to give blood. We can try very hard in our own behavior to be kind to other people.'' Rabbi Levitt added: ''We all want to know that there is still Godliness in the world. We want to feel like there is some stable moral foundation.'' AFTER THE ATTACKS: THE CHILDREN
One of the first to study apoA-1Milano was Dr. Prediman K. Shah, who directs the atherosclerosis research center at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. He reported it prevented plaque growth in arteries of rabbits and in mice. At higher doses, it even reversed the accumulation of plaque in mice. It took just six weeks. ''There was still skepticism at this point,'' Dr. Shah said. ''But we were convinced.'' Then he asked how quickly he could see an effect in the mice. ''Holy moly, to our big surprise, within 48 hours what these mice showed,'' he exclaimed. ''The cholesterol content of the plaques had dropped by almost 50 percent. Almost 50 percent of the lipid was gone. And the inflammation had dropped. The plaques had regressed.'' After conducting early tests of the H.D.L. in humans, looking for safety, Esperion approached Dr. Nissen. He had developed a technique, intravascular ultrasound, that involves threading a tiny ultrasound camera into arteries and directly observing plaques and precisely measuring their size. Would he direct a small study using that method to look for the drug's effects on plaque?
The group has treated 30 women, Dr. Cohen said, and they have given birth to 15 babies. About 30 babies have been born worldwide as a result of this technique, he added. But the cytoplasm of an egg contains more than just proteins to help an embryo grow. It also contains mitochondria, which are self-contained tiny structures that use oxygen and nutrients to create energy for the cells. And mitochondria have their own genetic material. That gave rise to a question. If the investigators injected cytoplasm containing mitochondria into an infertile woman's egg and then fertilized the egg and created a successful pregnancy, would the baby have genes from three people: the infertile woman, the man whose sperm fertilized the egg, and the woman whose egg was the source of the additional cytoplasm? The answer, Dr. Cohen and his colleagues reported, was yes. In the March issue of a British journal, Human Reproduction, they described a genetic fingerprinting method they used to detect mitochondrial genes from the donor cytoplasm in blood cells of two 1-year-old babies born with this technique.
In his studies, Dr. Leibel said, he purposely recruits people who are obese but have no other health problems. That way, he explained, when he studies the effects of weight loss he reduces the likelihood that his data will be confounded by other disorders. ''You can find people like that; they're out there,'' Dr. Leibel said. ''People would say, they must be dyslipidemic, they must be diabetic,'' he said, referring to abnormal blood lipid and blood sugar levels that are supposed to be endemic in the obese. But, he said, ''They are not.'' And it is not just humans who can be inured to the effects of excess body fat. ''There are mouse strains that are infamous for this effect,'' Dr. Leibel said. When scientists give one strain, the C57BL/6J mice, an obesity gene, the animals grow hugely fat but never develop diabetes. But if they give the same gene to another mouse strain, called C57BLKS/J , the mice not only grow fat but are dead of diabetes in five months.
Prostate-cancer experts caution that the finding, while surprising and intriguing, does not mean that current methods of dealing with prostate cancer are misguided. Many questions remain as to whether  P.S.A. actually fights cancer, and  any possible use of it as a treatment  is still very much in the future, depending on much more research. For now, the finding is more an intellectual challenge to researchers than a practical discovery. ''It's very interesting from a basic-science point of view,'' said Dr. John McConnell, chairman of the department of urology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. ''But it is sort of hard to say whether this is going to translate into anything of benefit to individual patients right now.'' Dr. Kramer, who is not only the journal's editor but also deputy director of the division of cancer prevention at the National Cancer Institute, said: ''It is an unanticipated effect, and its medical application is unknowable. In general, it means it has the potential for changing a paradigm, for changing the way we look at a particular cancer-related mechanism.''
They are also working with human embryonic stem cells, venturing into the most controversial area of stem cell work. Human embryonic stem cells are derived from human embryos, about a week old, and the only way to get the stem cells is to destroy the embryos. Some human stem cells came from embryos that were donated by couples at fertility labs who had embryos left over after they decided their families were complete. Others came from embryos that were created to obtain stem cells; researchers paid women to donate eggs, fertilized them and let them grow to the stage where stem cells could be extracted. The federal government has agreed to pay for research with human stem cells, but only for work with 22 lines; each line is the progeny of a single embryo. That restriction dates from Aug. 9, 2001, when President Bush issued a directive saying the government would pay for research, but only with cell lines created before that date.
But soon the picture became clouded. A few years ago, scientists found a third chimpanzee with an AIDS-like virus, but when they analyzed that virus, they discovered that it was only distantly related to H.I.V.-1. So, some asked, were chimpanzees really the source of the human AIDS epidemic? Or were chimpanzees, and humans, becoming infected by some other animals? One way to find out would be to study wild chimpanzees and see whether they had a virus like the human form, H.I.V.-1, whether they had a different virus like the third chimpanzee's virus or whether they were infected with a variety of AIDS-like viruses. But the only way to find viruses was to look for them in blood. And researchers could not draw blood from the elusive animals without stunning them first with a tranquilizer gun, and the stunning effort was impractical. To make matters worse, no one could show that the animal with a virus like H.I.V.-1 came from the region where the human epidemic first exploded.
Dr. Zipes said he planned to implant defibrillators in patients who should be helped and argue with their insurers later. ''Very honestly, if it were I or my father or a loved one, I'd want them to get it,'' he said.
But the study also found that the patients taking naproxen had just one quarter the number of heart attacks of those taking Vioxx. Twenty Vioxx patients, 0.5 percent, had heart attacks, compared with four, or 0.1 percent who took naproxen. ''There are two possible interpretations,'' Dr. Scolnick said. ''Naproxen lowers the heart attack rate, or Vioxx raises it.'' Either cox-2 inhibitors shift the clotting balance, or naproxen, which can impede blood clotting, has a protective effect. And so, while the company announced the heart attack findings to doctors and the public, it looked back at its data from studies using different drugs or dummy pills in comparison to Vioxx. It found no evidence that Vioxx increased the risk of heart attacks, Dr. Scolnick said. He said the company decided that ''the likeliest interpretation of the data is that naproxen lowered lowered the thrombotic event rate,'' meaning that it protected patients from heart attacks. He added that without the theoretical question raised by Dr. Fitzgerald, ''no one would have a question remaining in their mind that their might be an additional interpretation.''
Despite this limited success, Professor Andrews said she saw the experiment as essentially cracking open a door into a future world where genetic enhancement was sold by fertility clinics. She said she anticipated that many people would seize the chance to enhance their baby genetically, citing a recent poll in which 43 percent of couples who were asked said they would use genetic interventions to improve the physical capabilities of their child and 42 percent said they would want to upgrade their child's mental abilities. Others were not so sure that the monkey experiment foretold human genetic engineering. ''There is nothing we have done that accelerates genetic modification in people,'' Dr. Schatten said. ''In many ways, the results should be sobering to renegades who think of extending this to humans. Let's say you want your kid on the basketball team. You can't take him to the coach and say, 'He has this growth gene in there but it's not expressed and he's not growing.' ''
He has spent most of his career in academia and has published 625 research papers. His list of honors and awards includes this year's the Master Award, given to one person a year by the American Academy of Dermatology. In 1999 he started his own academy, supported by AmeriPath, a company that owns pathology laboratories. ''I had nothing to sell -- I was always in university life,'' Dr. Ackerman said. ''If you'll excuse the expression and not think I'm a tart, they bought me.'' His academy, he says, is now the world's largest training center for dermatopathology. Dr. Ackerman, who is paid a flat salary, and his six associates examine more than 100,000 specimens and have done more than 4,000 consultations each year. Dr. Ackerman continues to teach and write, and also to ask for data and question his field's conventional wisdom. Challenging the link between sun and melanoma is part of this pattern.
The results led them to a particular gene, PB2, that is used in viral replication. They continued the substitution process on a finer scale, working this time at the level of the bases, the chemical units that make up a gene. That led them to a tiny  mutation that made all the difference. The lethal virus, they discovered, had an alteration in one base in that gene. That, Dr. Kawaoka said, let the bird virus grow in mice. Dr. Lambert, of the infectious diseases institute, said the change in the PB2 gene also appeared to allow the chicken virus to infect people. And, she said, the lethal chicken strains in Hong Kong in 1997 already had the hemagglutinin change and were rapidly evolving to have the PB2 genetic change as well. Another paper, published in the same issue of Science, suggests a new hypothesis to explain why the flu virus that swept the world in 1918 was so deadly.
''If you talk to experienced heroin addicts, they tell you all the subjective effects of morphine,'' Dr. Wise said. ''It's like a symphony.'' But the effect that makes them crave the drug, Dr. Wise said, is an intense, stimulating euphoria, an effect just like the effect of cocaine or amphetamines. ''The high they are going for is all the same,'' he added. The same thing happens with animals. ''If you give an animal a general injection of an opiate like heroin, it is likely to slump to the floor and not get up. But if you inject heroin directly into the part of the brain where it is rewarding, it makes the animal run around like it was given amphetamine,'' Dr. Wise explained. That, he said, ''is the common denominator of addiction.'' The dopamine that rushes to the brain's reward center attaches itself to a group of cells, the medium spiny neurons. These in turn can make other nerve hormones, the small proteins, or peptides, known as enkephalin, dynorphin and substance P.
In Detroit, as in many other large cities, abortion protesters have not been a problem. The main problem is competition from other clinics. In New York, two of the largest clinics, Parkmed and Eastern Women's Center, coexisted for more than a decade, about two blocks from each other near Park Avenue South and 30th Street. But last year they had 30 percent fewer abortion patients than they did in peak years in the late 1980's and early 1990's, said Ted Weiselberg, who owned Parkmed. So the two New York clinics decided that the only way they could survive was to merge, forming Parkmed Eastern Women's Center. The new clinic not only does abortions -- about 15,000 a year, said Mr. Weiselberg, one of its owners -- but it offers gynecological services as well. ''It's like any other service,'' Mr. Weiselberg said. ''You have to lower your fee to attract enough patients to allow the office to pay its rent and you have to diversify to be successful.''
Dr. Grant and her colleague Dr. Bow Tong Lett recently asked another question: how long does runner's high last in rats? They took advantage of a striking effect, elicited both by addictive drugs like morphine and by running: the animals learn to prefer a place they associate with feeling high. So when Dr. Grant and Dr. Lett allow rats to run and then put them in a special room, like one with horizonal stripes, the animals learn to like that room. Given a choice, they will enter the room with the stripes and wait there. It is as though they associate the room with a good feeling and so the room itself starts to please them. But what if the rats have to wait before going into the special room? If they still feel high when they enter it, they will learn to like the room, Dr. Grant said. If not, the conditioning will fail. That led Dr. Grant and Dr. Lett to ask how long the running high lasts.
Dr. Walston agreed. ''There are people who exercise like crazy and still get frail,'' he said. Dr. Lipsitz said that while he strongly encouraged people to keep active and to exercise regularly, no one could guarantee that those who followed such advice would be protected from becoming frail. ''We don't want to portray an elitist attitude about aging, that if only you were better behaved you would avoid these things that accumulate with age,'' he said. Dr. Hadley said the continuing research offered hope for new interventions in addition to exercise. ''This is now looking ahead and speculating a little bit,'' he said. ''We don't know yet if these inflammatory and blood clotting factors are consequences of frailty or if they contribute to it. But if it's the latter, that would suggest drug therapies.''
''You haven't got a smoking gun, but you're never going to have one,'' Dr. Holmes said. ''The gun's long gone. You're never going to find it.'' Yet, he said, there is the virus in chimpanzees, there is the geographical overlap between where chimpanzees live and where H.I.V. started, and there is a mechanism. ''That was it for us,'' Dr. Holmes said. But knowing the virus came from chimpanzees left two pressing questions. When did the virus take hold in the human population? And how? Dr. Bette T. Korber, a molecular geneticist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and her colleagues had a way to get an answer to the question of when. They had the genetic sequences of viruses isolated from people and knew when those viruses were found, starting with the oldest human H.I.V. sample available. It was from a man in what is now Kinshasa, Congo, in west-central Africa, in 1959.
The data, published in May, were not quite the ringing endorsement that many had hoped for. The study found a subgroup that seemed to benefit -- patients with emphysema located mostly in the upper lobes of their lungs and little ability to exercise. They survived longer and could exercise more after they had the operation. But that is not rigorous evidence, since any set of data will include small subgroups that benefit and others that are harmed. In evaluating trials of new drugs and procedures, the Food and Drug Administration does not accept such subgroup analyses, requiring a second trial for the subgroup that may benefit. But a second trial of the lung operation is unlikely, many medical experts said. The first one was so controversial that some doctors would not participate, saying it would be unfair to their patients to deny them the surgery if they fell into the control group.
Some answers should emerge from a study, now under way, sponsored by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Cancer Institute, and the Agency of Health Research and Quality. It includes 731 men, mostly veterans, with localized prostate cancer, usually found by a P.S.A. test. Half were randomly assigned to have a their prostates removed and the rest to watchful waiting. The study is to continue until 2008 unless a clear survival advantage emerges for either the surgery or watchful waiting. So far, five years into the study, no such advantage has appeared, said Dr. Timothy J. Wilt of the Minneapolis V.A. Medical Center. ''I would like to conclude that while the Swedish study is a very important piece of information, when put into context, the preferred treatment for prostate cancer still is not known,'' Dr. Wilt said.
Drug prices could increase, some drug company executives say, but they add that drugs will be so much more effective that they will be worth more to patients. Of course, optimistic predictions of scientists and drug companies can go awry, and until the revolution in pharmacology takes place, it is hard to know if the glowing predictions are accurate. So far, only a relatively few genetic variants have been found and only a small number of these have been shown to have medical consequences. In Mr. Wegele's case, there was no good drug to slow his disease. But that did not mean he had not been helped. Based on their data from a continuing study that now includes about 500 patients with congestive heart failure, doctors at the University of Cincinnati hospital said that the only long-term hope for people with Mr. Wegele's  genetic variant was a heart transplant. ''We test everyone who has congestive heart failure,'' said Dr. Stephen Liggett, a lung specialist and molecular geneticist at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, who discovered the genetic variant and its effects on congestive heart failure. Dr. Liggett said it was his opinion that those who had the genetic variation, like Mr. Wegele, ''should be put on the transplant list early and they should have more aggressive drug therapy.''
And once it was withdrawn from the market, surrounded by accusations that it caused birth defects, he said, doctors became afraid to give pregnant women any medications to relieve nausea and vomiting. That, Dr. Scialli said, led to an unfortunate situation. ''There is a therapeutic nihilism,'' he said. ''Patients just have to suffer. Not only is that inhumane, it also is not safe. You can lose weight, you can become dehydrated. Women end up getting hospitalized for intravenous fluids or parenteral nutrition and are given nourishment through a vein.'' When Bendectin's maker, Merrell Dow, removed the drug from the market, it said it was doing so because the cost of defending itself against an avalanche of lawsuits was simply too great. It was not jury verdicts or punitive damages that took their toll but simply the expense of dealing with thousands of lawsuits, said one of the company's lawyers, Frank Woodside of Cincinnati. In fact, Mr. Woodside said, the company prevailed in court. ''We have never ultimately lost a case,'' he said.
And, she adds, there are now so many chemicals in the environment that the task of figuring out what effects they might have is dizzying. ''Nobody can keep up,'' Ms. Brenner said. ''And we don't know the health effects. I think it is not an irrational response to say our environment is making us sick.'' That is not Dr. Gallo's view. Even though he had cancer, he is not blaming environmental exposures. ''If I were to take that tumor that came out of me and grind it up and run it through a mass spectrometer, I could find every persistent organic chemical I've ever been exposed to,'' he said. ''Is that cause and effect? No, it's an association.'' Still, he understands the concerns. ''We, the scientific community, should take the blame for this,'' Dr. Gallo said. ''Toxicologists, and I'm one of them, have perpetuated the idea that if 100 molecules are going to kill you, then one molecule is going to kill 1 percent of somebody. And that's the problem. We have a tremendous ability to analyze anything and everything, and the scientific community has said: 'Oh, by the way, we ran this chemical in rodents and found cancer. And therefore  .' ''
Education matters. California Cryobank only takes men who are in college or who graduated from a four-year college. At the Fairfax bank, ''there is a preference for guys with medical and law degrees,'' Mr. Jaeger says. Some sperm banks reveal more about their depositors than others. The Fairfax bank, for example, provides adult photos if the donor agrees. The California bank does not, fearing that they could identify the donor years later and cause real problems. The Fairfax bank asks donors if their offspring can contact them when they are 18. The California bank will not do that but will try to discreetly contact a donor and ask if he wants to be identified to an adult child. ''We have felt we have some obligation to anticipate issues that a young man of 21 or 22 or 23 may not anticipate,'' Dr. Sims says. ''To take an extreme example, let's say we had Bill Clinton as a donor when he was in college. Later he becomes president.''
Each strain develops insulin resistance, a prediabetes state that afflicts virtually all obese people, Dr. Leibel said. But the the C57BL/6J mice compensate -- their pancreases produce more insulin. The C57BLKS/J mice try to make enough insulin to protect themselves, but they fail. Many obese people do not even have insulin resistance, said Dr. Ethan Sims, an obesity expert who is a professor emeritus at the University of Vermont. In a recent paper published in the journal Metabolism, he described a study at the university's medical school of 43 sedentary, postmenopausal, obese women. The women had were not recruited because of their insulin sensitivity or resistance. But, he said, 17 of them turned out to have completely normal insulin responses. Dr. Reubin Andres, the chief of the metabolism section of the intramural section at the National Institute on Aging, said there was a crucial question about such people that he wanted to address: What happens to them over a long period of time? Do they eventually develop diseases, like diabetes or heart disease, that are more common among the obese? What is their mortality rate?
Some, like Dr. H. Ballentine Carter, a professor of urology and oncology at Johns Hopkins University, urge caution about biopsying men with P.S.A. levels below 4. ''We will find a lot of cancer, and we will not know what to do about it,'' Dr. Carter said. ''That is very worrisome.'' ''The reason for caution,'' Dr. Carter said, ''is because right now we don't have the ability to know who in this low P.S.A. range has a cancer that is likely to be harmful. There is nothing wrong with doing a P.S.A., but we don't need to act on it immediately. We have an out here: We can follow men over time, and biopsy those whose P.S.A. goes up.'' Dr. Thompson, the study's chief investigator, said men needed to be counseled about their options. ''People say, 'What's the problem with treating it?''' he said. ''But every treatment has side effects.'' ''Even watchful waiting comes with a cost,'' he added, explaining that the option of being monitored to see if a cancer grows or a P.S.A. level rises can exert a psychological toll.
Fetal cells are more amenable to cloning than adult cows. But, Dr. Lanza said, the question of whether cloning is safe applies to all cloning, whether it involves fetal, embryonic or adult cells. He said his data showed that the alarms were misguided. ''We ran every medical and scientific test that was available,'' Dr. Lanza said. ''Everything is perfectly normal.'' He added, however, that the procedure was still not safe enough to use in humans. Dr. Steen Willadsen, a cloning pioneer in Windermere, Fla., who cloned more than 100 cows from embryo and fetal cells in the 1980's, said that while he did not do detailed biochemical and genetic tests of his clones, those that survived were generally healthy. ''At this point, it does not seem reasonable to maintain, as some have said, that all cloned animals are abnormal,'' Dr. Willadsen said. He added that some of the problems that critics cite with cloning -- the tendency for calves to be huge and to die shortly after birth -- occur when calf embryos are grown in the laboratory and appear not to be caused by cloning itself. But most clones that survive are fine, he said.
That is the same argument made by two statisticians at the disease control agency, Dr. David Williamson and Dr. Katherine Flegal, who published papers this year reporting that the statistics used to calculate the obesity deaths were wrong. They noted that the way to estimate deaths from obesity was to look at each age group and ask how many deaths might be due to obesity and then add the numbers to get the total deaths. That is the way the agency calculated tobacco deaths, coming up with a figure of 435,000. But for obesity, the agency looked at the death risk in younger people and extrapolated it to the entire population. In response to the obesity analysis, the Office on Smoking and Tobacco at the centers circulated its own analysis of tobacco deaths. Using the same methodology as had been used for obesity, it came up with about 640,000 deaths from tobacco.
The Journal of the American Medical Association published two papers on the study, one reporting on the randomized trial and the other on the patients who chose not to be randomized. It also published editorials by Dr. Carragee and Dr. Flum. The reason for all the attention, Dr. Flum explained, was that the study was large and well designed, that its authors had no conflicts of interest, and, ''We can learn a lot.'' The message, in the end, Dr. Weinstein said, was that no matter which treatment a patient received, ''nobody got worse.'' He added, ''We never knew that until we did the study.''
Over the years, researchers have found hundreds of drugs to slow the growth of cancer. But they have found virtually nothing that can prevent cancers from forming. The goal is not just a drug to stop cancerous cells from growing. It must also be safe enough to be taken for years by healthy people, most of whom will never get cancer. Now, however, scientists at the National Cancer Institute say they have a promising candidate, an aspirinlike drug, known as a selective cox-2 inhibitor, that is commonly used to treat arthritis pain. By accident, scientists found that such drugs might also prevent cancer. It remains to be seen whether cox-2 inhibitors will actually help prevent cancer. The path of medical history is littered with the remains of promising compounds that turned out to be useless. But the story of how these drugs made their way to the forefront of cancer research shows that serendipity and the chance observations of an individual doctor can still change the course of research, even in these days of high-tech drug design and sophisticated genetics and molecular biology.
The uncertainties mushroom as earlier and earlier cancers are found. To gauge risk, pathologists grade cancerous cells, assessing how disordered and abnormal they look. In the new study, among the men with P.S.A. levels less than 4 whose biopsies showed cancer, 14.9 percent had high-grade cancers, in which the cells look aggressive and threatening under the microscope. But even that result is difficult to interpret, Dr. Parnes said, because the association between grade and outcome is based on studies of much larger cancers, in men with much higher P.S.A. levels. ''Most people would assume that the high-grade cancer cells are going to be significant if you live long enough,'' Dr. Parnes said. ''But because we are diagnosing the cancers so early, we don't know how long they would take to manifest. And not everyone is going to live long enough to develop clinically relevant cancer. The lower the P.S.A. threshold, the deeper into the unknown you're going.''
It is a world that obsesses Dr. Barker. Animal studies and data that he and others have been gathering have convinced him that health in middle age can be determined in fetal life and in the first two years after birth. His work has been controversial. Some say that other factors, like poverty, may really be responsible. But Dr. Barker has also won over many scientists. In one study, he examined health records of 8,760 people born in Helsinki from 1933 to 1944. Those whose birth weight was below about six and a half pounds and who were thin for the first two years of life, with a body mass index of 17 or less, had more heart disease as adults. Another study, of 15,000 Swedish men and women born from 1915 to 1929, found the same thing. So did a study of babies born to women who were pregnant during the Dutch famine, known as the Hunger Winter, in World War II.
Scientists caution that human cloning is far too dangerous to contemplate at this time, but several groups have announced that they are trying anyway. Cloning has turned out to be much riskier than anyone had predicted. Most attempts at cloning fail, and even animals that survive until birth have had serious, often fatal, problems with their lungs, their hearts or their immune systems. While scientists have cloned a variety of species, including mice, pigs, cattle and a cat, and have even cloned clones, the procedure remains difficult and unpredictable. Even when it has worked, there have been thousands of failures along the way. But for Dolly, life was good. For her first 10 months, she shared a stall with two other sheep, but she would grab their food and she soon began growing fat. She would assert her authority by turning over her trough as soon as she finished eating and placing her forefeet on it, puffing out her chest and preening. Deciding that Dolly was not good at sharing, the Roslin staff finally put her in a stall by herself.
Dr. Rush, believing that blacks were immune to yellow fever, asked two prominent black men, Absolom Jones and Richard Allen, to help. The two persuaded the mayor to release black prisoners to help in the relief effort, which consisted of bleeding and purging patients and carrying away the bodies of the dead. Blacks turned out to be just as susceptible as whites, however, and many died of the fever. The epidemic ended abruptly in November, with the first frost that killed the mosquitoes. On Nov. 14, the city's mayor announced that those who had fled could safely return. And the newly discovered letters were stored away at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia. The mystery, however, is, How did they end up in that wooden box, which apparently dates from around 1900? Ms. Worden, the museum director, said the papers probably were put there in 1901 by someone who was packing up the college's papers during its move to its present building.  And, she added, it is possible that the box with its valuable papers had simply been kept in the locked closet ever since. It was found now, she added, because the college was renovating.
''People are afraid to eat in restaurants, afraid to go to peoples' houses,'' Dr. Sampson said. The new study, immunologists explained, is the culmination of decades of work on allergic reactions and the surprising discovery that many severe allergies are essentially the same immune system event. The list includes allergic asthma, allergies to peanuts and other foods, allergies to drugs like penicillin, allergies to pollen and even allergic eczema. All are set off by an antibody, IgE, or immunoglobulin E. No one knows why one person reacts to one substance and someone else to another. Many people have more than one allergy. Dr. Sampson said most people who died from peanut allergies also had asthma. The more IgE in blood, the more allergic the person is. A drug that blocks IgE should in theory protect against all the allergies. The challenge was to find a way to block it. TNX-901 and Xolair, the asthma drug, are antibodies to the IgE antibody.
Dr. Manson suggests that people measure a course and time themselves, making sure they walk a mile in 15 to 20 minutes. ''People may tend to overestimate their walking pace,'' she said. The goal, she added, should be to walk 10,000 steps a day. Many people, she said, are sure that they are doing at least that, until they put on a pedometer and discover that they actually are walking just 4,000 or 5,000 steps. ''I also make the point to my patients that casually strolling around the mall and window shopping will not produce these health benefits,'' Dr. Manson said. Many medical experts still worry that their exercise message is being heard, but ignored, and that the pattern dates back at least to the call to alarm in the 1950's. The report on American youth, described in the U.S. News article, led President Dwight D. Eisenhower to say he was shocked by the finding. In response, he established the President's Council on Youth Fitness. In 1968, it became the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, with a mandate to promote exercise and fitness for Americans of all ages.
''It's like the Antabuse of weight control,'' Dr. Heymsfield said, referring to the drug prescribed for alcoholics that makes them ill if they drink alcohol. ''The goal is not to make people reach an ideal weight,'' said Dr. Hauptman of Hoffmann-La Roche. Instead, he said, it is to help people ''reach a more biologically acceptable weight,'' one where they are healthier. Medical experts called in by the Food and Drug Administration were divided over orlistat's value. The F.D.A. usually follows its experts' advice but is not required to do so. In March, an advisory committee to the agency split, 5 to 5, on the question of whether the drug should be marketed. Dr. Hirsch, a member of that committee who voted against approving the drug, said he considered the weight loss minimal and the improvements in heart disease risk factors so small that it was impossible to say that the drug would lead to improved health. And even if people took the drug religiously, they would start to gain back their lost weight after a year, he noted. Given what he saw as minuscule benefits, Dr. Hirsch worried about possibly ephemeral hints of risks.
Yet scientists say the treatment he hopes for is a long way off. Their immediate goal is basic research into questions like the genetic basis of diseases. Even the term so often used, ''therapeutic cloning,'' implies more than they are prepared to deliver. ''At this stage,'' said Dr. Hans R. Sch√∂ler, a professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, ''to say we are developing therapies, I would be very, very careful.'' In discussing the promise of stem cell research, some scientists say they weigh their words carefully. ''We are mindful that this field has been overhyped,'' said Dr. Irving Weissman, who directs the stem cell institute at Stanford University. But when he tries to lower patients' expectations, ''I feel like I'm shouting into the wind.'' Yet, says Dr. Lawrence S. B. Goldstein, a professor of cellular and molecular medicine at the University of California, San Diego, ''People want you to try.'' He said, ''You have to try. We owe no less to these folks.''
When she arrived, Dr. Grotta asked if she was sure she wanted the drug. Did she want to risk bleeding in the brain? Dr. Fite did not hesitate. The stroke, she said, ''was just so devastating that I would rather die of a hemorrhage in the brain than be left completely paralyzed in my right side.'' ''In my horrible voice, I said, 'Yes, I want the tPA,' '' Dr. Fite said. Within 10 to 15 minutes, the drug started to dissolve the clot. ''I had weird spasms as nerves started to work again,'' Dr. Fite said. ''An arm would draw up real quick, a leg would tighten up. It hurt so bad I was crying because of the pain. But it was movement, and I knew something was going on.'' Now, she looks back with dismay on her cavalier attitude toward high blood pressure. She knew very well how to prevent a stroke but, like many patients and despite her medical training, she found it all too easy to deny her own risk.
Medical researchers are increasingly questioning one of the most widely held beliefs in preventive medicine: that screening healthy people for cancer and catching it early saves lives. The evidence shows that some screening tests are much more useful than others, said Dr. Barnett Kramer, the director of the Office of Medical Applications of Research at the National Institutes of Health. Some, like Pap tests for cervical cancer and tests for colon cancer, show clear benefits. But evidence for  others, like mammography and a blood test for early signs of prostate cancer, is less clear, researchers say, and some experts dispute whether their widespread use actually reduces death rates from cancer.  And some new tests, like spiral CT scans of the lungs, are being marketed to patients before they have been shown in large, rigorous studies to benefit anyone. Tests that detect cancer cannot always discern whether the cancer is one that will ultimately kill or is an indolent tumor that might never produce noticeable symptoms.
In other genetic diseases, gene alterations disable cells. In cancer, genetic changes give cells a sort of superpower. At first, as scientists grew to appreciate the complexity of cancer genetics, they despaired. ''If there are 100 genetic abnormalities, that's 100 things you need to fix to cure cancer,'' said Dr. Todd Golub, the director of the Cancer Program at the Broad Institute of Harvard and M.I.T. in Cambridge, Mass., and an oncologist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ''That's a horrifying thought.'' Making matters more complicated, scientists discovered that the genetic changes in one patient's tumor were different from those in another patient with the same type of cancer. That led to new questioning. Was every patient going to be a unique case? Would researchers need to discover new drugs for every single patient? ''People said, 'It's hopelessly intractable and too complicated a problem to ever figure out,' '' Dr. Golub recalled.
Researchers said that if estrogen reduced the risk of Alzheimer's disease, that might swing the balance, making it advisable for some women to take it. Alzheimer's studies, however, have had conflicting results. Animal and laboratory studies indicated that estrogen might protect the brain. But clinical studies have failed so far to make the case. Dr. Breitner said his findings might explain the previous studies by positing that there is a critical period, years before Alzheimer's symptoms emerge, when a woman must take estrogen if she is to reduce her risk. ''What's new here is that the benefits, if there are any, are delayed a long time after treatment,'' Dr. Breitner said in a telephone interview this week. He explained, however, that his study observed whether women who chose to take estrogen were less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease. One problem is that women who take hormones after menopause are different from those who do not take the drugs. Hormone users tend to be more educated, for example, and healthier. Some of the very features that make them likely to take hormone therapy are also features that, independently, are associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer's disease. Scientists use statistical adjustments to try to correct for the differences between hormone users and nonusers, but they can never be sure they have succeeded.
Scientists know that very strict low-calorie diets can prolong life. But now they report that it does not matter when you start that diet -- at least if you are a fruit fly. The life-prolonging effect kicks in immediately, continues as long as the diet, and is lost as soon as the dieting stops. ''We were very surprised, completely taken aback,'' said Dr. Linda Partridge, a professor at University College London, whose laboratory made the discovery. For now, no one has a clue about what the crucial changes are in a fly's body when it goes on or off a diet. ''It's been assumed that the reason things live longer when they diet is that there is a slowing down of age-related damage,'' Dr. Partridge said. But, she added, it now appears that cannot be true. ''The system has no memory.'' In a detailed demographic analysis of life and death among 7,492 fruit flies, published today in Science magazine, Dr. Partridge and her colleagues discovered that the protective effect of dieting snaps into place within 48 hours, whether the diet starts early in life or late. Flies that dieted for the first time in middle age were the same as flies that had been dieting their whole lives. But the effect can be lost just as quickly. Flies that dieted their entire lives and then switched, as adults, to eating their fill were the same two days later as flies that had never dieted.
Mr. Dasey, the spokesman at Fort Detrick, says his phone rings all day with calls from scientists wanting his help. He also gets e-mail messages, and letters. And many scientists call everyone they can find at Fort Detrick, all at once, Mr. Dasey said. He tells the scientists that they can send in a proposal and wait to hear if the scientists at Fort Detrick are interested. Before the anthrax bioterrorism, it took a couple of months to get a reply, Mr. Dasey said. ''There's no way to say how long it will take now,'' he added. Mr. Sudovar says he is looking at other options, noting that there are a couple of other places that may be able to test his anthrax drug. But they, too, are overwhelmed with calls from scientists and companies seeking help. Katy Delaney, a spokeswoman for the Battelle Memorial Institute, with headquarters in Columbus, Ohio,  said her company did most of its research under contract for the Defense Department and preferred not to discuss its work. But she conceded that she had gotten quite a few calls from scientists and fledgling companies wanting to test drugs. Battelle, however, also is limited in what it can take on. ''We were already busy before this started,'' Ms. Delaney said.
For most people, however, the issue is not deficits. Instead, nutrition researchers ask: Do people eating relatively healthy diets with fresh fruits and vegetables and not too many calories or fats benefit from multivitamins or other supplements? Do those whose diets are abysmal, heavy on fast foods and lacking in fruits and vegetables, make up for some deficits if they take multivitamin pills? Dr. Annette Dickinson, president of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a group that represents the supplement industry, says 70 percent of Americans sometimes take supplements -- usually multivitamins or individual vitamins and minerals -- and 40 percent take them regularly. ''Our position,'' she said, ''is that most people, literally most people, would benefit from taking a multivitamin every day. It's insuring adequate and even generous intake of all the nutrients.'' The most popular individual supplements are vitamins C and E, said Dr. Robert M. Russell, the director the Human Nutrition Research Center of Agriculture Department at Tufts University, who is head of the Food and Nutrition Board. Scientists once thought those vitamins could help prevent ailments like cancer and heart disease, but rigorous studies found no such effects.
In the meantime, Dr. Mucke studied mice that he and his colleagues genetically modified so that they produced human amyloid proteins. Long before those proteins were deposited in plaques in the animals' brains, he found, nerve synapses were damaged. As a consequence, nerve signals were not being transmitted. Dr. Masliah, his colleagues and Dr. John Morris, a neurologist at Washington University in St. Louis, looked in the brains of people who had what might have been the earliest stage of Alzheimer's, known as mild cognitive impairment; those who had end stage dementia; and those of older people who were not demented. When Dr. Masliah examined the brains of people free of dementia, he found healthy synapses. Brains of people with mild impairment had damaged synapses, and the damage was even more pronounced in people with Alzheimer's. That, he said, ''suggests to me that Alzheimer's disease is a disease of synaptic connections.''
The National Institute on Aging are analyzing their data to get some answers, Dr. Andres said. Since 1958, it has been following thousands of people, gathering data on their health, including body weights and blood sugar levels. ''It is important to know what this population is like and what happens to them,'' Dr. Andres said. At the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, this is the question being asked: Do fat people who already have diabetes and who lose weight become healthier? In particular, do they have lower risks of heart attacks and strokes, does their diabetes improve, and do they live longer? Although there is a widespread belief that weight loss will improve health, a number of large studies have raised questions about whether that is true. Dr. Andres explains that weight loss can improve blood sugar levels, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. ''On a population basis, you can expect all of those bad things to improve,'' he said. ''It all makes sense. If you lose weight and all these things improve, it has to be good for you.'' But, he added, ''The only problem is that when you look at mortality rates, they don't look good.''
He was not surprised. ''It was pretty much equivalent to what other recent studies had showed,'' he said. But were children more active a decade or two ago? No one knows for sure. ''The ways to monitor physical activity are much newer than that,'' Dr. Strauss said. The other side of the obesity picture is eating. Many blame what children consume and the way meal times seem to have fallen by the wayside. ''We don't sit together at the dinner table in a peaceful environment, but instead grab a 1,200-calorie fast-food meal,'' said Dr. David Ludwig, a pediatrician who does diet research and runs a pediatric weight-loss clinic at Children's Hospital in Boston. National survey data, however, have created a puzzle. Children today do not report eating more than they did in decades past and, in fact, according to their answers to the same questions asked in previous surveys, may be eating slightly less.
Correction:  April 20, 2005, Wednesday  A front-page article on Thursday about a danger to athletes from drinking too much water misstated the standard unit of measurement for sodium in blood. It is millimoles per liter, not micromoles.
Some people call it disease-mongering, says Dr. Lisa Schwartz of Dartmouth Medical School. She once calculated that if everyone had the recommended tests for blood cholesterol, blood sugar, body mass index and diabetes, 75 percent of adults in the United States would be labeled as diseased. And new diseases arise by the minute, she says, her favorite example being ''restless legs.'' Even cancer rates can be hard to compare from one country to another, noted Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, also of Dartmouth, and, with Dr. Schwartz, a researcher with the V.A. Outcomes Group in White River Junction, Vt. Here, men over 50 routinely get a blood test for prostate cancer, the P.S.A. test, when they have medical exams. It is so accepted that some doctors do not even tell the men they are doing the test. Here, free skin-screening clinics pop up every year and doctors advise people to have their skin examined regularly for cancer. Here, women get mammograms starting at age 40, and they get them every year thereafter. Here, even thyroid cancer screening is on the rise.
''They know the basic workups and options,'' said Dr. Mark V. Sauer of the College of Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia. ''They even talk about specific ovulation-induction products, endometrial thickness measurements, whether the Doppler flow studies were adequate. ''They want to know the specific scores of their embryos in cultures,'' Dr. Sauer said. ''I've had patients break down and cry over their embryo scores.'' Dr. Alan DeCherney of the University of California, Los Angeles, says he has had patients who say they want everything and ignore him when he advises that not everything is useful. ''I have had people who fly to New York to get tests that have been shown to be of no help,'' he said. It is easy to see where the money goes, doctors say, especially with clinics offering a smorgasbord of items that can add thousands of dollars to a pregnancy attempt. Some are generally accepted, including intracytoplasmic sperm injection to fertilize eggs, assisted hatching to help an embryo break loose and grow, defragmentation of embryos to clean up stray pieces of cytoplasm, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, embryo freezing and storage, and donor sperm and eggs.
''I never commercialize anything,'' Dr. Rabin said. ''I am not in that business.'' Instead, he said, he did the work because it was a challenge. Dr. Rabin's idea is simplicity itself, at least in the world of encryption. Previous coding methods rely for their security on the limitations of computing power. They assume that if breaking a code requires enough calculations, even the best computers will not be able to do it. But, Dr. Rabin said, there is no proof that such codes are secure. Their security hinges on the belief that no one will find a shortcut to doing the calculations. It is always possible that such a shortcut exists, waiting to be discovered by a clever mathematician. Dr. Rabin relies instead on the limits of memory banks in computers. No matter how powerful a computer is, no computer can store an unlimited amount of data. And yet that is what is required for an eavesdropper to break his code.
Covance, a large American company that conducts trials for drug companies under contract, opened offices in Russia and Poland a few years ago and in Hungary last year. ''The standards of medicine are high'' in those countries, said Dr. Alan Wood, Covance's general manager for global clinical development services, and it is easy to recruit patients. Richard Leach, the American business manager of Russian Clinical Trials, a six-person company in St. Petersburg, Russia, explained the appeal of doing studies there. The doctors are well trained but earn as little as a few hundred dollars a month, Mr. Leach said, and they are eager for the money they can get as clinical trial investigators. Doctors even want to be study monitors, traveling to medical offices to be sure protocols are followed. That job, done mostly by nurses in the United States, pays much more than Russian doctors earn for treating patients.
In their efforts to protect Americans from the hazards of radiation, federal agencies have found themselves in a quandary. People are constantly exposed to radiation from natural sources -- from cosmic rays, radon seeping out of the earth and radioactive substances in soil, water, food and even from potassium in the human body itself. Compared with this radiation, the amounts coming from human efforts like  nuclear plants are, relatively, minuscule. So, the question is, How closely must this radiation be regulated? Up to now, regulators have typically acted as if every bit of excess exposure is potentially hazardous. But some scientists question this assumption. The issue is becoming increasingly pressing as more than 100 nuclear power plants are being relicensed so they can continue to operate. At the same time, the country faces a growing predicament of what to do with nuclear waste from power plants and weapons sites. ''The issue rages because we are regulating doses that are lower than the natural background of radiation,'' said Dr. Arthur Upton. A radiation expert and former director of the National Cancer Institute, Dr. Upton is a professor of environmental and community medicine at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.
And while screening picks up cancers that would become deadly if left unnoticed, in many cases it also picks up tiny cancers that might have gone nowhere -- people would have died with them, not of them. Autopsies have repeatedly found that people often have such cancers, but had they been found through screening and treated, people would have thought they'd been ''cured.'' That phenomenon, overdiagnosis, is a recognized consequence of increased screening, medical researchers say. A telltale sign is a cancer whose incidence rises but whose death rate does not budge. The most recent example was with thyroid cancer. This month, in a paper in JAMA, Dr. Welch reported that the incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States had increased by 250 percent over the last two decades. But the death rate from it remained the same. Screening is much less common in Britain, Dr. Heath says. For example, she said, ''we don't do P.S.A. screening for nonsymptomatic men, and we don't do skin screening.''
''This study is unprecedented,'' Dr. Michalek said. ''We have so many end points.'' But, as statisticians point out, that makes it very likely that something will turn up by chance alone, making it especially difficult to sort out whether an effect is real. Dr. David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California, says he grows wary when a study looks at large numbers of possible outcomes and then makes complicated statistical adjustments to come up with a positive finding for one of them. ''The more types of funny analyses you see, the more your antennae can be quivering,'' he said. At this point, Dr. Michalek said, he is unwilling to say whether he thinks that dioxin really does cause diabetes. ''I am a scientist,'' he said, explaining that he is awaiting results from the biochemical studies. Some veterans, however, say it is time that the Department of Veterans Affairs compensates them if they develop diabetes.
For the casual rider, such details are almost arcane; for the serious rider, they become crucial. ''If you get on an ill-fitting bike and ride five miles -- I've done that and still had fun,'' Mr. Schwinn said. ''If you told me to ride 20 miles, it would be a death roll. If your typical ride is 30 miles or more, relatively subtle differences can have a big impact.'' Entering the world of custom-made bikes means trusting a frame builder in an arena where builders learn their craft by apprenticeship, and by trial and error, and where there is no way of knowing if their performance claims are correct until your first ride. Over the years, Mr. Vandermark said, frame builders develop their own systems for fitting and building a bicycle and consider them to be trade secrets. The fine details can make the difference between one that is O.K. and one that is almost magical.
The oldest of four boys, Dr. McClellan was a National Merit Scholar and valedictorian of his Austin, Tex., high school. By his senior year in high school, he was taking classes at the University of Texas. He graduated three years later from the university, with three undergraduate degrees, in honors biology, honors English and something called Plan 2, which is an accelerated liberal arts program. Then he began graduate study. He got a medical degree from Harvard Medical School, a Ph.D. in economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a master's degree from Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government all at once. Along the way he took classes at Harvard Law School, where he met a law student who became his wife. He also met Dr. Garber, a professor of medicine and economics at Stanford. ''I identified him as someone I wanted to recruit,'' Dr. Garber said. ''But I'm not the only person who recruited him. It was clear he was going to be a star.''
Patrick Keogan wanted to be big, like the men with the ripped muscles he saw at the gym. ''I was training like an animal,'' he said, working out seven days a week. But he seemed to have reached his biological limit: 5 feet 8 inches tall, 150 pounds. ''Finally, it dawned on me,'' he said. Those huge men at his gym who insisted they were simply lifting weights were dissembling. ''There was something they were not telling me,'' Mr. Keogan said. Thus Mr. Keogan, a 30-year-old salesman who lives near Boston, entered the world of anabolic steroids -- testosterone and other drugs that act like it, which can build muscle, fast. He soon was taking 4,000 milligrams of testosterone a week, which he bought from dealers at his gym. (A man his age normally produces about 35 milligrams a week.) Within 20 weeks, he weighed 200 pounds. ''People would look at me,'' he said, and ask, ''What did you do?''
So for now, doctors and dentists are perplexed. Firm data are scarce to nonexistent, studies that may provide answers are only about to begin, and medical organizations and drug companies are scrambling to provide guidance, often based only on hunches. Some dentists are refusing to treat patients taking the drugs, fearful that the dental work will induce a case of osteonecrosis, and lawyers are lining up to sue the drugs' makers, saying they failed to give patients adequate warning. Doctors say worried patients hearing about the ailment are starting to besiege them. The patients want to know whether they should stop taking the drugs. They want to know whether they should shun invasive dental procedures, like tooth extractions and implants, which appear to set off the condition. They want to know whether osteonecrosis of the jaw can be treated and, if so, how likely it is that a person will recover.
For patients, they represent a chance at future fertility, which is why so few want to give them up. In a sense, said Dr. Jacques Cohen, the director of research at St. Barnabas, an infertile couple's decision to keep their frozen embryos is not so different from a fertile couple's decision not to be sterilized after their family is completed. The embryos take on additional value, doctors and embryologists say, because obtaining them is so expensive and emotionally draining. A patient has typically spent years trying to have a baby, and invested huge sums -- usually more than $10,000 a month for the fertility center and $3,200 a month for drugs. A medical team has worked intensively to induce her ovaries to produce eggs. A team of embryologists, laboring in a tension-filled atmosphere, has manipulated the microscopic eggs to produce an embryo. ''It is a clump of cells, but it is a very important clump of cells,'' Dr. Garrisi said. ''It may not be a human being, but it certainly has potential and I think it deserves respect that is greater than that accorded to an egg or sperm. An embryo is more important if for no other reason than all the work it takes to get it.''
David Giere and his wife, Linda, got the dreadful news that she had Alzheimer's disease during Christmas week of 2001. They had gone to the Mayo Clinic to find out what was wrong with Mrs. Giere. At age 46, she seemed much too young to have Alzheimer's but had been losing her memory, was getting lost driving on familiar routes, and was finding herself unable to prepare her favorite recipes. ''Meals got simpler and simpler,'' Mr. Giere said. ''The Thanksgiving meal was a turkey; there were no side dishes.'' The Gieres wept as they drove home from the Mayo Clinic to their home in Morrison, Colo., and their 7-year-old twin daughters. Mrs. Giere's disease, her husband said, has progressed since then. He asked Dr. Petersen about memantine. The doctor said that he would not write him a prescription but that in Mrs. Giere's situation, given that she was young and healthy, and that the drug seemed safe, it might be reasonable to try it. But he cautioned that its long-term safety was still unknown.
''For Archimedes, as for all others from antiquity, we don't have the original works,'' Dr. Netz said. ''What we have are copies of copies of copies.'' Investigators evaluate copies by asking whether they agree on the text they have in common, and by looking for unique passages, which lend them particular interest. By those measures, the manuscript was invaluable. But it was nearly lost. In the 13th century, Dr. Netz explained, Christian monks, needing vellum for a prayer book, ripped the manuscript apart, washed it, folded its pages in half and covered it with religious text. After centuries of use, the prayer book -- known as a palimpsest, because it contains text that is written over -- ended up in a monastery in Constantinople. Johan Ludvig Heiberg, a Danish scholar, found it in 1906, in the library of the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Istanbul. He noticed faint tracings of mathematics under the prayers. Using a magnifying glass, he transcribed what he could and photographed about two-thirds of the pages. Then the document disappeared, lost along with other precious manuscripts in the strife between the Greeks and the Turks.
The extra surgical treatment prompted by screening can be harmful, the researchers noted. The death rate from lung cancer surgery is 5 percent. In addition, 20 percent to 40 percent of people who have such surgery have serious complications, like heart attacks, large blood clots in their lungs, pneumonia that requires time on a ventilator, and infections leading to repeat operations. The new study's conclusions are very different from those reached in the previous study of CT scans. There, researchers, led by Dr. Claudia Henschke, a professor of radiology and cardiothoracic surgery at Weill Cornell Medical College, reported that more than 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could be prevented with CT scans. But Dr. Henschke's did not try to compare mortality rates in people who were screened to the rates in those who were not. Instead, in her analysis, she assumed everyone with lung cancer would die of it without treatment. Then she followed some patients for a median of three years after their cancer was detected and from that estimated the 10-year survival of screened patients. That -- survival rates -- is a very different question from death rates, many noted.
''There's almost certainly going to be a backlash,'' said Dr. James A. Thomson, the University of Wisconsin scientist who first isolated human embryonic stem cells. ''These are novel, unproven therapies. I believe there is tremendous promise, but it's going to take years to develop therapies.'' He said, however, that the media, not scientists, were at fault for the exaggerated promises. ''I blame the press,'' Dr. Thomson said. ''It is very compelling to be able to make new body parts. It captures the imagination.'' But Dr. Inder Verma, a gene therapy researcher at the Salk Institute in San Diego, said scientists set off the frenzy with their own hyperbole. And, he said, he has seen this sort of process unfold once before, with disastrous consequences. Gene therapy, Dr. Verma said, had the same sort of promise attached to it two decades ago. In that field, too, scientists predicted too much too soon. When gene therapy failed, many turned against it. Stem cell therapy is heading in the same directions, Dr. Verma said, and some scientists are beginning to worry.
Some breast cancer experts, like Dr. Marc Lippman of the University of Michigan, say they were not at all surprised by the Canadian researchers' result because it makes so much sense. Advanced cancer is such an assault on the body that it would be incredible if the groups had such a life-prolonging effect, Dr. Lippman said. ''I was more astonished by the original Spiegel observation,'' he said. Now, Dr. Holland said, she hopes patients will relax their grip on the support group hypothesis. She regularly sees its damaging effects, she said, giving a recent example of a woman whose husband died of lung cancer and who was in agony over what might have been. ''She said, 'I feel so guilty. I never got him to go to one of those groups.' ''
She cites, for example, the life spans of three small mammals: the mouse, the canary and the bat. Mice live about 2 years, canaries 13, and bats 50. ''I don't know why evolution selected for different life spans, but it did,'' Dr. Kenyon said. Because evolution acts on genes, that means that scientists can ask whether they can deliberately stretch an organism's life. To test her hypothesis, Dr. Kenyon began looking for simple genetic alterations that could extend the life of C. elegans. It did not take her long to find one: mutations in a gene, called daf-2, that allow the worms to live for a month instead of two weeks. And unlike other mutations that seemed to increase the worms' longevity, the worms with mutated daf-2 genes were fine -- healthy and vigorous. When they near the end of their two-week lives, ''normal worms look horrible,'' Dr. Kenyon said. A young worm has a certain body posture, Dr. Kenyon explained, moving vigorously and making a nicely shaped wave as it wriggles along. An old worm, by contrast, has a pockmarked body and cells that are filled with gunk. It lies around listlessly. But old worms with the daf-2 gene mutation ''look great,'' she said. It is as though they have a perpetual youth. ''Even a dead daf-2 looks better than a dead normal worm,'' Dr. Kenyon said.
Professor Eisenberg, the patent expert from the University of Michigan, said the courts say that patents for molecules like genes should go to the person who envisions what they look like and identifies a practical use for them. ''You can't envision a molecule by saying, 'Here's a disease, here's some tissue, go for it,' '' she said. ''The fact is that we rely on the private sector to develop diagnostic and therapeutic products, and the private sector is profit driven,'' Professor Eisenberg said. ''People may contribute their tissue in the expectation that nobody is going to make a profit on it, but that's a little naive. There's no free lunch here.'' The reason for patents is to provide incentives for inventors, she said. ''When people see these innovations creating millionaires and billionaires overnight,'' she said, ''they may think, 'Why not me?' '' But, she said, the truth is somewhat different. ''Most patents have no value,'' Professor Eisenberg said. Developing gene products, she said, ''is a very risky invention.''
In the absence of a full clinical trial, patients and doctors ''are left in the lurch,'' said Dr. William Bremner, the chairman of the department of medicine at the University of Washington. Dr. Bremner says he continues to prescribe the drug but with a caveat: ''I can't sit here and tell you that it will decrease your risk of fractures. And I can't tell you it won't increase your risk of prostate cancer.''
Dolly, the sheep who made history as the first clone from a mammal, died yesterday in Edinburgh. She was 6. She was put to death after developing a lung infection, her veterinarians said. On Friday afternoon, veterinarians who had been treating her at a veterinary school about two miles from the pen that was her home agreed that the infection was progressing and that she was suffering. They concluded that it would be more merciful to end her life than to continue treatment, Dr. Ian Wilmut, a scientist at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh who led the team that created Dolly, said in a telephone interview. Her illness and death, Dr. Wilmut said, probably had nothing to do with the fact that she was a clone. ''It could equally well have happened if she was not a clone,'' he said. After a post-mortem examination, Dolly's remains will be given to the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh and put on display.
''All you have to do is look at the experience of countries like England that have had health insurance for more than 40 years,'' he says. ''There is no diminution in the class differentials. It's been the same in Sweden. It's true everywhere.'' In fact, Dr. Smith says, the wealth-health connection, at least among adults, goes in the wrong direction. It is not that lower incomes lead to poor health so much as that poor health leads to lower incomes, he found. A Skewing of the Numbers Sick people tend to have modest out-of-pocket medical expenses, but often are unable to work or unable to work full time. The result can be a drastic and precipitous and long-lasting drop in income. As the ranks of middle- and upper-income populations become depleted of people who are ill, there is a skewing of the data so healthy people are disproportionately richer. That effect emerged when Dr. Smith analyzed data from the National Institute on Aging's National Health and Retirement Survey, a national sample of 7,600 American households with at least one person aged 51 to 61.
Also because of an editing error, the article misstated the title of Richard Doerflinger, who maintains that stem cell proponents are misleading the public about their accomplishments. He is deputy director for pro-life activities -- not ''anti-abortion activities'' -- at the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops.
Dr. Noller said he suspected that a reason the test was being done in these women anyway was that doctors were used to it. ''It's a relatively cheap and easy procedure,'' he explained. ''It's sort of become a habit.'' Dr. Alan Waxman, another author of the obstetricians and gynecologists' guidelines and an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico, said women expected the test. ''Many women equate the Pap test with the pelvic exam,'' Dr. Waxman said. ''So they come in every year for their Pap test even if they don't need it any more.'' He spelled out a scenario. ''The woman didn't need to be tested,'' Dr. Waxman said. But she had a Pap test anyway. ''The test shows a mild abnormality. Then she gets treated, just to be on the safe side.'' Now the woman is labeled as a cancer patient. ''It all adds anxiety, discomfort, and expense,'' he said.
A growing number of medical experts are concerned that Americans are overdoing their vitamin consumption. As many as 70 percent of the population is taking supplements, mostly vitamins, convinced that the pills will make them healthier. But researchers say that vitamin supplements cannot correct for a poor diet, that multivitamins have not been shown to prevent any disease and that it is easy to reach high enough doses of certain vitamins and minerals to actually increase the risk of disease. No longer, the experts say, are they concerned about vitamin deficits. Those are almost unheard of today, even with the population eating less than ideal diets and skimping on fruits and vegetables. Instead, the concern is with the dangers of vitamin excess. ''There has been a transition from focusing on minimum needs to the reality that today our problem is excess -- excess calories and, yes, excesses of vitamins and minerals as well,'' said Dr. Benjamin Caballero, a member of the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academy of Sciences and the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at Johns Hopkins University.
Ms. Sabo's history shows that a thin child can become massively obese in adulthood.  That raises the question of whether it is possible through some combination of diet and exercise in childhood to prevent people like Ms. Sabo from becoming obese. The case of Ms. Haworth, of Savannah, Ga.,  poses another question: Should parents try  to make fat children thin? The 17-year-old Ms. Haworth has been fat since she was 6 years old, and now, at 5 feet 9 inches, she weighs 300 pounds. She is also an Olympic weight lifter and so fast and so flexible that she can run a 40-yard dash in 5.5 seconds, jump 30 inches into the air, and can do a full split. Ms. Haworth has emphasized in interviews that she is healthy, fit and confident. ''I know a lot of 17-year-olds don't weigh 300 pounds, but I was never really discouraged because I was so big,'' she said recently.  ''It's who I was, who I am. I knew I wasn't the right size or shape for certain things, but I didn't let it bother me. I decided to look for something else.''
Despite huge advances in medicine and technology, trauma care has, in many ways, been stuck in the past century, medical experts say. A soldier wounded in Iraq will get the same salt solution that was used in Korea. Army doctors in Iraq have the same problems storing blood that plagued doctors decades ago. No one yet knows the best way to treat a head injury. And it is unclear whether drugs can stem hemorrhages from internal bleeding. One reason trauma research has languished, scientists say, is that the Defense Department, the institution with perhaps the biggest interest in improving care for sudden, serious injuries, was long prohibited by law from participating in most clinical research in trauma or financing it. The law was changed last year, spurred by the efforts of an Army nurse who was appalled by what she saw in Kosovo. Now a multitude of opportunities are opening for trauma research.
A new study by the National Institutes of Health indicates that only 20 percent of men with moderate symptoms progress to more severe ones over a five-year period. MOST men who are seriously bothered by their symptoms opt for medication, urologists said. These are men who get up repeatedly at night to urinate, or who can't get through a meeting without rushing to the men's room. There are two types of drugs that can help. The alpha blockers relax muscles that contract the prostate and the neck of the bladder, allowing urine to flow more freely. Two alpha blockers, doxazosin and terazosin, are available as generics. Originally developed as drugs to treat high blood pressure, they were later discovered to be effective against B.P.H. Their disadvantage is that doctors have to start with a low dose, gradually increasing it so the men do not get dizzy from excessively low blood pressure. A third drug, tamsulosin, also known as Flomax, was developed more recently for B.P.H., and avoids that low blood pressure problem, Dr. McConnell said.
''We think it helps control the long-term energy balance,'' Dr. Barsh said. ''In one 24-hour period, you or I may eat half of what we eat in another 24-hour period. But over the long term our body fat remains stable. So there needs to be a mechanism to account for that stability. Or supposing you went on a drastic diet for three or four days. There will be a drive to eat; you feel hungry. Where does that drive come from?'' The regulator, Dr. Barsh suggests, could be the protein he found. By manipulating its action, he hopes, it may some day be possible to stanch those irresistible drives to eat. Another protein, known as melanin concentrating hormone, or M.C.H., makes mice and rats eat and grow fat. Dr. Maratos-Flier, who discovered the protein's role, also found that it is in the hypothalamus and that it, too, is made when leptin flows to the brain. ''People have the exact same hormone,'' Dr. Maratos-Flier said.
Dr. Hugh C. Hendrie, a psychiatry professor at Indiana University School of Medicine and the lead author of the new study, published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, said he wanted to see if the disease incidence varied in different environments. One of the most profound differences in environment would be between a developed and a developing country, he reasoned. His colleagues at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria were sophisticated and experienced in studying neurological disorders, he said, making it possible to compare the incidence of Alzheimer's disease in the two populations. The two groups are not genetically identical, but the ancestors of most American blacks came from West Africa. The Ibadan residents in the study were traders at small markets. They are extremely poor, unable to afford much more than vegetables to eat, Dr. Hendrie said, with a diet consisting of things like yams, cassava and palm oil with sometimes a sprinkling of fish. The study participants in Indianapolis were typical Americans, with the typical American diet.
Dr. Nadelman said many doctors, in hopes of heading off Lyme disease infection, had been giving 10-to-21-day courses of the antibiotic to people who had found deer ticks on their bodies. ''They would be treating people as if they actually had the disease,'' he said. He and his colleagues wondered whether one dose would be enough. They recruited 482 people in Westchester County, N.Y., where the incidence of Lyme disease is among the highest in the world. All had found deer ticks on their bodies. (The insects were identified by entomologists.) Half got a single dose of doxycycline, taken in the form of two capsules, and the others got two dummy capsules. The investigators found that the drug did prevent Lyme disease: just one person, 0.4 percent of those who took it, came down with the illness. But even among those who took the placebo, the chances of getting the disease was just 3 percent.
In most states today, parents are not asked if they want their babies tested, though they have the right to decline it; it is simply done, with the cost, about $70 to $120, built into their hospital bills. Dr. Howell said the idea of the new recommendations was ''to try to organize the programs and to try to be consistent from state to state.'' ''Some states screen for four conditions; others screen for 35,'' said Dr. Michael S. Watson, the federal project's director and the executive director of the American College of Medical Genetics. ''A family can have their first child in one state where 25 conditions are screened and then move to another where only four are screened.'' Yet, critics say, the fact that testing is happening does not mean that it should be expanded. The history of newborn screening, they say, is filled with cautionary tales. ''The majority of newborn screening tests have failed,'' said Dr. Norman Fost, a professor of pediatrics and director of the program in medical ethics at the University of Wisconsin. Over the years, Dr. Fost said, ''thousands of normal kids have been killed or gotten brain damage by screening tests and treatments that turned out to be ineffective and very dangerous.''
A popular prescription drug to prevent unwanted pregnancies is safe enough that it should be made available over the counter to the women who urgently need it, an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration recommended last week. The F.D.A.'s commissioner, Mark McClellan, must now decide to accept or reject the finding, and faces an intense debate over the ethics of selling the morning-after pill, called Plan B, as if it were no different from aspirin, for example. But what about the scientific question? If the pill is so safe, and so important, why was it sold by prescription in the first place, as it has been since 1999? The decision to sell a drug by prescription, experts say, may involve factors that have nothing to do with science or patient safety. Marketing and financial considerations, politics, doctors' concerns and consumer psychology all may play a role. ''Unequivocally, there is no bright line,'' said Peter Barton Hutt, a former chief counsel at the F.D.A. who now teaches at Harvard and represents drug companies. ''It's a judgment issue.''
The doomsayers look about them and see a national disaster, an obesity epidemic that shows no signs of abating. Every time it seems Americans can get no fatter, they gain a bit more weight. These experts foresee an ever-ballooning population gobbling ever greater quantities of food while getting ever less exercise. The Journal of the American Medical Association exhorted doctors to counsel fat patients about diet and exercise. It also called for a campaign to combat Americans' growing girths. If the nation can mount a national effort against cigarettes, why not do the same for obesity, the journal asked in an editorial. ''The time has come to develop a national comprehensive obesity prevention strategy that incorporates educational, behavioral and environmental components analogous to those already in place for tobacco use,'' the journal said. Those who expect a pharmacological fix see the beginning of a new age of drug development that will find molecules that make fat people lose interest in eating to excess. Perhaps the drugs should be reserved for those cursed with the most stubborn obesity, some researchers say, but at the very least they should help very fat people who cannot control their weight.
In just two years, CT Screening International had grown to a national chain. ''It was a very big operation, and it was an enormously rewarding operation,'' said its chief executive, Dr. Richard Penfil. The business also appealed to radiologists who normally send reports to doctors but have little contact with patients. At the scanning center, though, Dr. Brant-Zawadzki sat down with patients and discussed their scans. ''It was very pleasurable,'' he said, adding that ''it also promoted the value of radiologists to those patients.'' Dr. Carl Rosenkrantz, a radiologist in Boca Raton, Fla., said the business had another appeal -- it promised radiologists a good living without being on call at a hospital and even without necessarily being present at the scanning center. ''The goal in life seems to be to try to figure out some way where you don't have to go to the hospital, where you don't have to take calls,'' Dr. Rosenkrantz said. ''Radiologists saw this as a cash business and a way out.''
Dr. Hahn envisions one day understanding the genetic changes that breast cancer cells share with colon cancer cells for example and the ones that make the cancer cells different. Others hope to use the findings to devise tests to determine whether benign tumor cells are on the verge of turning cancerous. The current discovery has its origins in another seminal paper, also published by Dr. Weinberg. In 1983, he reported that the addition of just two mutated genes that had been isolated from cancer cells can turn normal rat cells into cancer cells in the laboratory. ''It said that cancer was a molecular event,'' Dr. Hahn recalled, adding that everyone assumed human cells would be next. But to scientists' surprise, when they did the same experiment with human cells it never worked. Dr. Ronald DePinho, a professor at Harvard Medical School and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, said that many molecular biologists took up the challenge.
In theory, Dr. Wogan said, there is hope for untangling the mess. ''If we knew how to identify exactly which factors or agents or dietary factors were responsible and if we were able to identify their effects in people, then, in principle, cancer is preventable,'' he said. But, he added: ''It's so tough. It's so very tough to do.'' In the meantime, he and others say they take comfort in cancer statistics that do not indicate a cancer epidemic. Rates of cancer have been steadily dropping for 50 years, if tobacco-related cancers are taken out of the equation, said Prof. Richard Peto, an epidemiologist and a biostatistician at Oxford University. What appear as increases in cancers of the breast and prostate, Dr. Peto added, are in fact artifacts of increased screening. When healthy people are screened, the tests find not only cancers that would be deadly if untreated, but also a certain percentage of tumors that would never cause problems if let alone.
A longtime study of more than 46,000 people has found that a simple but little-used screening test may help prevent people from getting colon cancer. The test, known as fecal occult blood screening, seeks traces of blood in a person's stool, a possible sign of a cancer or benign polyps that can be precursors to cancer. When the polyps are removed, cancer is prevented. In the study, the colon cancer rate was reduced by as much as 20 percent among people who used the test. The federally financed study, described in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, was conducted by Dr. Jack S. Mandel, a vice president of Exponent, a Menlo Park, Calif., research company, and his colleagues, most of whom are at the University of Minnesota. Dr. Ernest Hawk, chief of the gastrointestinal cancer group at the National Cancer Institute's division of cancer prevention, said it was already known that the test reduced the colon cancer death rate, by detecting cancers in early stages.
Insurers continue to pay for annual physicals because that is what their customers demand, said Larry Akey, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association. ''The coverage of the physical is something companies do as a result of requests from our customers,'' he said. In addition, he said, while he is not sure all the member companies would agree, there is a widely voiced belief that the people who would be attracted by an insurance policy that includes an annual physical exam are exactly the health-conscious people an insurer wants. For Medicare patients and others whose insurance does not cover even a basic physical exam, the only choice is to pay for it themselves. Many do. Dr. Mark Miller, a colleague of Dr. Min at the Kernodle Clinic in Burlington, explains to patients that Medicare will not pay for what they want. ''I say, 'Medicare will not pay; do you want to?' I've had the rare patient say no.''
Dr. Freedman said the study had some serious problems, and he has less confidence in its conclusions. Dr. Berry says the flaws are minor and the conclusions are credible. Still, neither Dr. Berry nor Dr. Freedman convinced the woman in his life. The two women are over 50 and so of an age when mammography guidelines call for annual screening. Dr. Berry's wife has annual mammograms, although she is well aware of her husband's doubts about their worth. Dr. Freedman's woman friend has them only every three years, despite Dr. Freedman's urging that she have them annually. CONFRONTING CANCER
Some early studies indicated what was really happening, but were widely dismissed. As long ago as 1986, Dr. Greg Brown of the University of Washington at Seattle published a paper showing that heart attacks occurred in areas of coronary arteries where there was too little plaque to be stented or bypassed. Many cardiologists derided him. Around the same time, Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic started looking directly at patients' coronary arteries with a miniature ultrasound camera that he threaded into blood vessels. He found that the arteries were riddled with plaque, but almost none of it was obstructing blood vessels. Soon he began proposing that the problem was not the plaque that produced narrowings but the hundreds of other areas that were ready to burst. Cardiologists were skeptical. In 1999, Dr. Waters of the University of California got a similar reaction to his study of patients who had been referred for angioplasty, although they did not have severe symptoms like chest pain. The patients were randomly assigned to angioplasty followed by a doctor's usual care, or to aggressive cholesterol-lowering drugs but no angioplasty. The patients whose cholesterol was aggressively lowered had fewer heart attacks and fewer hospitalizations for sudden onset of chest pain.
But Dr. Catherine H. Van Poznak, a breast cancer specialist at the University of Michigan, said it was very hard to get good estimates of risk from the sort of data, mostly case reports, that have been published so far. ''The case definition in one report can be different from the case definition in another,'' Dr. Van Poznak said. And not every case has been published or reported. ''We've seen about 20 patients at Columbia,'' Dr. Landesberg said. ''But it's so impossible to get a handle on what the incidence is. You just don't know.'' Lawyers are advertising for plaintiffs, though, and beginning to file suits. Novartis says it does not comment on litigation. Merck, which makes Fosamax, a bisphosphonate for osteoporosis, says 15 suits have been filed against it, while Roche, which makes Boniva, used for osteoporosis, reports none. Two suits have been filed against Procter &amp; Gamble, which makes Actonel, for osteoporosis, and Didronel, for Paget's disease. All the companies say osteonecrosis never emerged in their clinical trials, involving tens of thousands of patients.
The researchers also found a slight suggestion that low fat might make a difference in breast cancer but the results were not statistically significant, meaning they may have occurred by chance. Still the study's results frustrate our primal urge to control our destinies by controlling what we put in our mouths. And when it comes to this urge, it is remarkable how history repeats itself. Over and over again, medical experts and self-styled medical experts have insisted that one diet or another can prevent disease, cure chronic illness and ensure health and longevity. And woe unto those who ignore such dietary precepts. For example, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the French 19th-century food writer, insisted that the secret to good health was to avoid carbohydrates. Brillat-Savarin, a lawyer, also knew the response his advice would provoke. '' 'Oh Heavens!' all you readers of both sexes will cry out, 'oh Heavens above!'' he wrote in his 1825 book, ''The Physiology of Taste.'' ''But what a wretch the Professor is! Here in a single word he forbids us everything we must love, those little white rolls from Limet, and Achard's cakes and those cookies, and a hundred things made with flour and butter, with flour and sugar, with flour and sugar and eggs!''
Dr. Norman Relkin, director of the Memory Disorders Program at Weill Medical College of Cornell, said studies testing ways to prevent or delay the disease would be completed in this decade. ''There is a high likelihood that one or more of them will be positive,'' Dr. Relkin said. ''Do I believe we will have a disease modifying intervention before 2025? Absolutely.'' If researchers had a dream about preventing Alzheimer's, it might go like this: A very safe drug is developed to treat a very common disease. Soon, millions are taking it, starting in middle age or even younger, when the terrible brain-cell death of Alzheimer's begins. Amazingly, it turns out that this safe and popular drug has an unexpected benefit. It provides protection from Alzheimer's disease, preventing it altogether in some people, staving it off for years in others. The predictions that Alzheimer's cases will skyrocket as baby boomers reach old age never come true.
In an early 19th-century best seller, a famous food writer offered a cure for obesity and chronic disease: a low-carbohydrate diet. The notion that what you eat shapes your medical fate has exerted a strong pull throughout history. And its appeal continues to this day, medical historians and researchers say. ''It's one of the great principles -- no, more than principles, canons -- of American culture to suggest that what you eat affects your health,'' says James Morone, a professor of political science at Brown University. ''It's this idea that you control your own destiny and that it's never too late to reinvent yourself,'' he said. ''Vice gets punished and virtue gets rewarded. If you eat or drink or inhale the wrong things you get sick. If not, you get healthy.'' That very American canon, he and others say, may in part explain the criticism and disbelief that last week greeted a report that a low-fat diet might not prevent breast cancer, colon cancer or heart disease, after all.
The problem, though, is determining a normal testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio. The World Anti-Doping Agency used to say that a ratio of more than six to one was evidence of testosterone abuse. Now it is using a ratio of four to one. Dr. Timothy Foster, an endocrinologist and sports-medicine specialist at Boston University Medical Center, said even the six-to-one ratio is within a range that could be found naturally in many men. ''If the ratio was five to one or six to one, I would be very concerned that this represents a normal variant,'' Foster said. Bhasin agreed. ''People can have high ratios without abuse,'' he said. He added that one way to know if the ratio found in the test was normal was to continue testing the athlete. If the ratio is normal for that man, it will not change. Endocrinologists also said it was important to know how the test was conducted and how carefully the samples were protected from tampering.
Mr. Hosmer said he became interested in steganography three years ago when he conducted a study for the Air Force looking at potential areas for cybercrime and cyberterrorism. ''We wanted to see what kinds of tools and weapons were being used by terrorist organizations,'' he said. To his surprise, he said, steganog raphy, an area he had paid little attention to, stood out because it could be so effective in hiding the very fact that people were communicating -- thwarting attempts to detect terrorist activities by looking for flurries of communications between members. Mr. Hosmer found more than 100 free steganography programs on the Internet and said he was shocked when the providers of the programs said there had been over a million downloads of the technology. ''It really struck us: why were there so many downloads?'' Mr. Hosmer said. Some, he said, may be hackers or people who are using it for fun. But, he said, he doubts that those are the only users.
A final concern, Dr. Black said, is that Dr. Henschke might have missed the deadliest cancers. People who seemed fine after their last CT scan were followed for only a year. If they developed a fast-growing lung cancer and died of it soon after, they would not be counted in the lung cancer survival rate. Dr. Kramer and Dr. Black are members of the executive committee overseeing the National Cancer Institute's National Lung Screening Trial, the randomized study of lung cancer screening. Screening tests are worthwhile, these researchers say, if the death rate in the screened group is lower than the rate in people who are not screened. ''Survival is a meaningless statistic,'' said Dr. Ned Patz, a professor of radiology at Duke University Medical Center who is an investigator in the National Cancer Institute study. ''What we want to do is reduce the number of people who die from lung cancer. And that is mortality. What we all want to know is mortality.''
''I think it's a good form of insurance,'' Dr. Manson said. ''I don't think there's a significant downside. We don't have the evidence yet that it is beneficial.'' Dr. Robert H. Fletcher, a professor of ambulatory medicine at Harvard Medical School, also takes multivitamins. For him, the deciding factor was whether he ingested enough folic acid. Studies have suggested that high levels of folic acid can protect against heart disease by lowering levels of another substance, homocysteine. High levels of homocysteine are associated with increased risks of heart disease, but there is no study showing definitively that reducing homocysteine levels protects against heart disease. So far, the folic acid studies are suggestive, not definitive. But Dr. Fletcher said, ''If I were a betting man, I'd bet on it.'' But a European study, reported recently at a meeting of the American College of Cardiology, found that folic acid supplements actually made matters worse for heart disease patients. The study, the Folate After Coronary Intervention Trial, involved 626 patients who were having stents inserted into blocked arteries to keep them open. Half were randomly assigned to take folic acid, and the rest took a placebo. Six months later, the arteries of those taking folic acid were significantly narrower than the arteries of those taking a placebo, exactly the opposite of what the investigators had expected.
''Doctors often forget that they set up their own private hell,'' Dr. Wasson of Dartmouth said. As word spread of Dr. Murray's innovation, other medical centers began asking him for help. About a year and a half ago, Dr. Murray stopped practicing medicine and, with Catherine Tantau, a nurse who had worked with him to develop the idea, began a consulting business on how medical offices can accomplish what he had had Roseville, or what they call ''open access scheduling.'' Many doctors in private practice say they are afraid to try open access, Dr. Murray said, because they think a warehouse of waiting patients assures them of income. ''They think the warehouse is filled with money,'' he said. In fact, Dr. Murray said, the warehouse is filled with ill will as irritated patients start looking elsewhere for medical care. And open access ends up producing at least the same revenue as the old system.
Dr. Costill joins the swimmers each day at lunchtime. Tall and lean, with an athlete's easy grace, he swims as fast now as he did in college, more than 40 years ago. He is, colleagues say, a legend in his field. One of the first, and still one of the few, to apply scientific methods to the study of exercise and training, he has published more than 400 papers and won awards from groups that include the American College of Sports Medicine, where he was president, and Runner's World. ''He's just a superb person as well as one of the top exercise physiologists,'' said Dr. Paul Ribisl, the chairman of health and exercise science at Wake Forest University. ''He's certainly done some of the most interesting work and he had a powerful influence on the field.'' Dr. Costill's specialty, Dr. Ribisl added, was to apply the methods of science to a field that had often neglected them. ''He's basically allowed the science to dispel the misconceptions,'' Dr. Ribisl said.
Examining more than 1,200 references, the group addressed the major questions about implants: Do they cause established connective tissue diseases, like arthritis or lupus? Do they cause breast cancer, nerve diseases, like multiple sclerosis, or new diseases with symptoms like aches and pains and overwhelming fatigue? Are children of women with breast implants at risk for disease because of silicone transmitted across the placenta or in breast milk? Do breast implants produce immunological reactions that could cause disease? In every case, the committee concluded, there was no convincing evidence that implants were at fault. When lawsuits were filed in the late 1980's and early 1990's there was a lack of research on the topic. Since then, according to the report, ''a number of strong, well-designed epidemiological studies involving large numbers of women and clear results have been published.'' For example, the group wrote, the evidence is ''insufficient or flawed.'' that implants cause ''atypical disease,'' a term covering signs and symptoms like weakness, fatigue, and diffuse muscle pain. But the group said that evidence on the other side is strong. ''Controlled epidemiologic studies cited'' led the committee to conclude that there was ''no novel syndrome.''
In desperation, a few doctors say they tell women essentially to make their own Bendectin. The ingredients, an antihistamine and vitamin B6, are available over the counter. But Dr. Julian T. Parer, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California in San Francisco, said, ''It's inconvenient.'' Dr. Parer says he tells women to take one vitamin B6 pill in the morning and two at night and to take a half pill of the antihistamine Unisom twice a day. He explains to the women that he is mimicking Bendectin. ''I do tell them that Bendectin was a drug that was on the market and that was withdrawn and that we believe it is safe,'' he said. Dr. Lockwood also suggests that women make their own Bendectin. ''I tell my patients, 'I'm going to give you something that is the equivalent of a drug called Bendectin, which is a great drug that was forced off the market by litigation,' '' he said. ''Our patients will take anything because they are so miserable.''
Dr. Papadakis said her results were ignored by growth hormone enthusiasts. ''They can't let go of the hypothesis because they like it,'' she said. Others, like Dr. Warner, worry about animal studies. ''I agree that mice and rats are not people, but mice that don't make growth hormone live longer,'' Dr. Warner said. ''Mice that overproduce growth hormone live shorter lives. The same principle applies in fruit flies and little worms called nematodes. It may be irrelevant, but it makes us wonder.'' The next major paper was published on Nov. 13 in The Journal of the American Medical Association. In it, Dr. S. Mitchell Harman of the Kronos Longevity Research Institute in Phoenix and Dr. Marc Blackman of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, part of the National Institutes of Health, reported that older men and women taking growth hormone lost fat and gained lean body mass without dieting or exercising. They did not formally assess the subjects' appearance. But Dr. Harman said, ''you could see that some of these guys lost a significant amount of pot belly.''
That famine lasted from November 1944 until May 1945. Women were eating as little as 400 to 800 calories a day, and a sixth of their babies died before birth or shortly afterward. But those who survived seemed fine, says Tessa J. Roseboom, an epidemiologist at the University of Amsterdam, who studied 2,254 people born at one Dutch hospital before, during and after the famine. Even their birth weights were normal. But now those babies are reaching late middle age, and they are starting to get chronic diseases at a much higher rate than normal, Dr. Roseboom is finding. Their heart disease rate is almost triple that of people born before or after the famine. They have more diabetes. They have more kidney disease. That is no surprise, Dr. Barker says. Much of the body is complete before birth, he explains, so a baby born to a pregnant woman who is starved or ill may start life with a predisposition to diseases that do not emerge until middle age.
Ask anyone: Americans are getting fatter and fatter. Advertising campaigns say they are. So do federal officials and the scientists they rely on. But Dr. Jeffrey Friedman, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University, argues that contrary to popular opinion, national data do not show Americans growing uniformly fatter. Instead, he says, the statistics demonstrate clearly that while the very fat are getting fatter, thinner people have remained pretty much the same. Let it be said that Dr. Friedman, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and the discoverer of the gene for leptin, a hormone released by fat cells, is not fat. He is tall and gangly, with the rumpled look of an academic scientist. As an obesity researcher, he might be expected to endorse the prevailing view that obesity in this country is out of control. But Dr. Friedman said he was outraged by the acceptance of what he sees as a hurtful myth, one that encourages people to believe that if you are fat, it is your fault.
The issue, he says, is not how much is being spent but whether spending more is the answer. Are those extra dollars buying marked improvements in health or are they making any difference? That, Dr. Deaton said, was the point of his exercise in trying to find out the cost of his hip replacement: ''Is it worth spending all this money on a hip replacement?'' In London, he said, a hip replacement costs ¬£5,000, or about $9,500. ''Don't you think people would prefer to have it for ¬£5,000?'' Dr. Deaton said. ''It is probably true that if we spent twice as much money on health care we'd be better off. But half the money we spend is wasted.'' That, Dr. Hall pointed out, is an important issue. ''We all know that especially in Medicare, where more and more of the spending is going to occur, there isn't anybody who has responsibility for making sure the money gets spent well,'' he said. ''Some huge improvements will have to be made as the consequences of that waste get greater.''
The initial enthusiasm for leptin resulted from some striking experiments in mice. A strain of monumentally obese mice turned out to lack the hormone. When they were given it, the animals lost their appetites and wasted away to normal weights virtually overnight. When researchers discovered that humans made leptin too, Amgen, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., quickly began studying it, moving rapidly from research with animals to research with people -- despite some early indications that leptin might not promote weight loss in many subjects. ''There was a lot of excitement and everyone thought, 'Wow, this could be the new panacea,' '' said Dr. Andrew S. Greenberg, an author of the study and the director of the program in obesity metabolism at the United States Department of Agriculture's Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University in Boston. Even if doses of leptin do not lead to steep drops in weight, obesity researchers say it does seem to play a significant role in regulating body fat.
The runners who developed the problem tended to be slower, taking more than four hours to finish the course. That gave them plenty of time to drink copious amounts of liquid. And drink they did, an average of three liters, or about 13 cups of water or of a sports drink, so much that they actually gained weight during the race. The risks to athletes from drinking too much liquid have worried doctors and race directors for several years. As more slow runners entered long races, doctors began seeing athletes stumbling into medical tents, nauseated, groggy, barely coherent and with their blood severely diluted. Some died on the spot. In 2003, U.S.A. Track &amp; Field, the national governing body for track and field, long-distance running and race walking, changed its guidelines to warn against the practice. Marathon doctors say the new study offers the first documentation of the problem. ''Before this study, we suspected there was a problem,'' said Dr. Marvin Adner, the medical director of the Boston Marathon, which is next Monday. ''But this proves it.''
If you think that the patient is going to live a year whereas, in fact, they are only going to live a month, you might make all sorts of clinical choices that are different from what would be ideal.  Q. In the meantime, though, what should doctors do? If their own textbooks and their own medical journals neglect prognosis, how can they predict what a patient's outcome will be?  A. There are two distinct issues here. There is the formulation of prognosis and there is the communication of prognosis. Most people will think that what we are talking about is breaking bad news -- how you communicate prognoses. That is a very small part of what I'm after. The basic and more fundamental problem is that physicians, for a variety of conscious and unconscious reason, don't even want to formulate prognoses, quite apart from whether they tell them to their patients.
''I measure CRP in everyone now,'' he said. He knows his own CRP level and while it is fine, he said, he has decided that if it started to creep up he would make sure he got it down. If he gained weight, he would ''exercise like crazy.'' If that did not work, he would take a higher dose of a statin. (Dr. Nissen has consulted for, received honorariums from, and done studies supported by drug companies, including the makers of statins. He is paid a salary and donates the honorariums to a charity he established at the American College of Cardiology.) Nearly half of heart patients have normal cholesterol levels. Dr. Nissen said that when he saw such patients and their CRP levels were above 2 milligrams per liter of blood, he prescribed a statin to lower their CRP. ''That's not such a leap of faith,'' he said. And if a patient has done everything possible, dieted, exercised, taken statins, and still has a high CRP?
They are also an increasing focus of research. Last fall, Dr. Oliver, the University of Chicago political scientist, went to Las Vegas to attend the annual meeting of the North American Association for the Study of Obesity, whose members include obesity researchers and doctors who run weight loss clinics. At lectures and other events, many sponsored by drug or medical supply companies, Dr. Oliver heard about the dangers of obesity. ''Wherever possible,'' he said, ''data were interpreted to portray obesity as a major problem, no matter how weak the actual findings were.'' One talk, he said, involved data correlating obesity with the risk of deaths from auto accidents, with the preliminary finding that obese men are more likely than thinner people to die when they are in a car crash. Such a conclusion would contradict the so-called obesity paradox -- the frequent observation cited by experts like Dr. Katherine Flegal, a statistician at the C.D.C., that the obese tend to fare better than thinner people if they are sick or injured.
Scientists report today that they have completed the first major step in deciphering the secrets of one of the deadliest viruses ever known, the  influenza virus of 1918. Though their work answers some questions about the origin of the virus, the scientists say it leaves the most fundamental question dangling: What made the virus, which killed 20 million to 40 million people worldwide, so lethal? Dr. Jeffrey K. Taubenberger of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology in Washington and his colleagues have determined the sequence of an essential gene, the hemagglutinin, finding that it is perfectly ordinary and dashing the hopes of those who had hoped it might hold the virus's deadly secrets. But an analysis of that gene did show that a popular hypothesis -- that the virus jumped  directly from birds to people -- was wrong. Dr. Taubenberger's paper is published today in the Proceedings of the  National Academy of Sciences.
Installing Vista would cost $10,000 to $12,000 for an entire medical practice. That means that a practice of five doctors might pay $100,000 to computerize, but if the doctors used the Medicare system they might pay only $10,000 for the whole office. The problem is that Vista has a reputation for being extremely difficult to install. Medicare says it modified and simplified it for doctors' offices, but it remains to be seen whether doctors will want it. Doctors are well aware that even with free software, no system is really free. ''Vista is a good system and it all sounds great,'' said Dr. Thomas Jevon, a family physician in Wakefield, Mass. But, he added, ''anyone who uses a computer can get frustrated and waste time trying to make it work.'' And for doctors, whose time is typically valued at $250 an hour, that time adds up. ''If a program takes 10 minutes away from your hour each day, that is costing you tens of thousands of dollars a year,'' Dr. Jevon said. ''That's what's bugging doctors.''
Hospitals and medical centers save money, in some cases tens of thousands of dollars a year, when they reuse the devices. Doctors say that manufacturers charge so much that they often cannot afford to use devices just once; nor can they pass the cost along to patients, because in many cases the rates have been set in advance by insurance companies or Medicare. And, they say, many expensive devices that are labeled ''single use only'' can safely be used repeatedly. Device makers reply that the hospitals are putting patients at grave risk to save money. ''The real issue is patient safety,'' said Josephine Torrente, president of the Association of Disposable Device Manufacturers. ''Until you prove otherwise, these devices are safe and effective for one use. After that, they're garbage.'' The F.D.A., caught in the middle, is considering regulating those who reprocess devices in the same way it regulates the original device makers. They would have to get approval -- showing the reprocessed devices were safe and effective -- before they could sell them. The only exception would be devices, like surgical saw blades, that are considered to pose a very low risk after being cleaned and sterilized. At the same time, the agency is suggesting that the device makers explain on their labels what the risks would be if the devices were processed.
That was when Dr. Hahn examined the frozen chimpanzee organs, and the mystery began to crack. That animal, she discovered, also had a virus in its tissues that looked like H.I.V.-1. Suddenly, said Dr. Edward Holmes, an evolutionary biologist at Oxford University, he and others who had questioned whether chimpanzees really were the source of H.I.V.-1 in humans, became convinced. While scientists had found only two, or possibly three chimpanzees that had the virus, Dr. Hahn's information, added to three other lines of evidence, was enough. One line of evidence pointed to west-central Africa -- a region where chimpanzees live -- as the place where the human AIDS epidemic began. Scientists, analyzing the genetic sequences of AIDS viruses found in patients from around the world, were discovering that the viruses in west-central Africa were the most diverse. And it is a general rule that the more diverse an organism's genes are, the longer it has been around. That is because as the years go by more and more variations accumulate in an organism's genes.
Scientists at Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Mass., say they have created 24 cloned cows that are normal in every way, an assertion that challenges the widely held view that cloned animals are prey to a host of defects. Last spring, leading scientists testified before Congress that cloned animals had so many defects that most died before birth or at it and that the survivors had a variety of problems. Given the high risk of serious defects, they said, it would be immoral to think about cloning humans. But the scientists at Advanced Cell Technology said 24 cows they cloned had been subjected to every test they could devise and had been shown to be normal. Scientists who have argued that cloning is unsafe say they remain to be convinced, saying the tests cannot detect subtle abnormalities like mental problems that might afflict human clones. Others say that since most of the cloning efforts resulted in miscarriages or stillbirths and medical problems after birth, the study actually confirms that cloning is dangerous. Most of the clones died.
''Pfizer could have lost big time,'' Dr. Nissen said. When the results were in, and the company was waiting to hear what they were, ''I never saw such nervousness,'' he said. Dr. Gary Palmer, the vice president of Pfizer's cardiovascular medicine group in the United States, said the company was very excited. ''For the first time, we've actually shown that you can impact the progress of this disease, which is the leading cause of death in the United States,'' Dr. Palmer said. But Julie Keenan, a spokeswoman for Bristol-Myers Squibb, noted that the study just looked at plaque, not at heart attacks or deaths. ''While these results are informative,'' Ms. Keenan said, ''additional studies will be needed to assess whether different statins would cause disparate reductions in clinical outcomes.'' Pravastatin has been shown to prevent heart attacks in people with high cholesterol levels, she added. Shares of Pfizer rose 60 cents to $32.40 yesterday, and Bristol-Myers Squibb rose 52 cents to $25.50.
Then the hospital signed up for TeleStroke, a program offered by two Harvard teaching hospitals, Massachusetts General Hospital and the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. For $10,000 a year, Martha's Vineyard Hospital links to the Harvard hospitals with videoconferencing and image-sharing technology. That allows stroke neurologists at the Harvard hospitals to examine patients remotely and assist the emergency room doctor in deciding whether to give tPA. The neurologists must rely on symptoms and CT scans, which are not ideal for diagnosing strokes, but they are experienced enough to often feel confident in their diagnosis. TeleStroke is what saved Florence Arnston when she had a stroke on Martha's Vineyard last October, on the first day of her vacation. Mrs. Arnston, who is 76 and lives in Lansing, Ill., was having an ice cream cone after lunch when her left hand suddenly felt numb and her foot dragged when she walked. She told her husband she did not feel well, and they returned to their tour group.
But parents of children with genetic diseases often tell a different sort of story. Micki Gartzke of Shorewood, Wis., gave birth to a girl, LeA, on Oct. 14, 1996. When LeA was just a few months old, her body became rigid, she would not eat and she cried inconsolably. She was found to have a rare genetic disorder that made her deficient in an enzyme, galactocerebrosidase, needed in the early stages of brain development. After two years of suffering and a quarter of a million dollars in medical bills, LeA was dead. Early diagnosis, Ms. Gartzke said, could have led to a lifesaving transplant of umbilical cord blood. The question posed by the new screening recommendations is whether they will lead to the kind of dangers that followed early PKU testing, or whether they will correctly identify babies like LeA who might have been saved. Medical specialists say it is difficult to know.
''Our belief is that if emergency contraception pills really were widely used, to their maximum potential, then the number of unintended pregnancies could be cut in half,'' said Dr. James Trussell, associate dean at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. ''It has a huge potential. But I can guarantee you that the emphasis in that sentence is on potential,'' he added. Plan B was born out of the passion of people like Dr. Trussell. It was the deliberate conception of a consortium of public health advocates who decided that there was a crying need for the drug, located a Hungarian company to make it and formed a company to market it in the United States. On July 28, 1999, the pill was approved for sale by the Food and Drug Administration, and on Aug. 23, 1999, the marketing company, called the Women's Capital Corporation,  filled its first order -- for Planned Parenthood of Pasadena, Calif.
At Covance Laboratories in Madison, Wis., a company that does drug research under contracts for universities and industry, the opinion was that basic research not involving drug development did not require the drug agency's approval. ''To do an experiment without the F.D.A.'s review is O.K. as long as it is based on strong scientific evidence and it has peer review,'' said Anthony Clemento, the company's vice president for regulatory affairs. Drug companies had the impression that academics played by different rules. ''The F.D.A. has a double standard,'' said Dr. Bert Spilker, who is vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. ''The standards for industry are much higher than those followed by academic investigators.'' Applying to the F.D.A. could cost millions of dollars, Mr. Clemento said. The paperwork typically takes months and costs $50,000 to $60,000, he said. The application requires an extensive review of published papers that could uncover drug toxicities, and the agency could require exhaustive testing in animals before the drug is given to humans.
Dr. Goodman said that despite the figures disseminated, like the task force's finding that there was a 16 percent mortality benefit with mammography, uncertainty reigned, and most scientists who studied the data were well aware of it. ''That's the shadow element. There is a level of scientific uncertainty that is not reflected in the numbers but exists in the minds of all the analysts,'' he said. In the end, he said, the mammogram debate reflected a conundrum of modern medicine. The answers that are needed -- what are the benefits and what are the risks -- are right at the fuzzy boundary of what science can deliver. He said it was like looking through a microscope at something just at the limits of resolution. ''Reasonable people can differ on what the evidence is,'' he said.
It also helps patients psychologically, he added. ''If you take athletes or active people out, they get depressed, they get wacky,'' Dr. Kocher explained. Noah Hano knows all about that. Mr. Hano, 34, a commercial real estate broker in Boston, was competing in marathons and triathlons. Then he developed severe sciatica, whose pain is a direct result of inflammation. He tried physical therapy, he tried acupuncture, he tried massage therapy, but nothing quelled the ''nagging, terrible pain'' down his leg, he said. He stopped exercising, but the pain persisted. ''I started getting desperate,'' Mr. Hano said. His father, who lives in the same town as Dr. Weinstein, suggested that Mr. Hano call the Dartmouth orthopedist. Dr. Weinstein told him to continue to exercise. Mr. Hano could not wait to get started. ''I drove to the gym and ran on the treadmill,'' he said. ''When I woke up the next morning, I went for a swim and rode my bike. It hurt, but when the doctor told me I wasn't going to be paralyzed, it made it a lot easier.''
''There's a package of rational behavior, and that's what I'm in favor of,'' Dr. Norton said. ''I think early diagnosis is part of a package that is making advances against cancer.'' CONFRONTING CANCER
The numbers have been inching down for decades, but only lately have doctors begun to appreciate how profoundly things have changed for heart attacks and strokes. They remain the leading cause of death in the United States, but their toll is nothing like what it used to be. They kill proportionately fewer people and -- in another major change -- they strike far later in life. Despite the obesity epidemic, the trends are continuing with no end in sight. The stereotypical heart attack patient is no longer a man in his 50's who suddenly falls dead. ''That death rate is so low now that we're no longer able to track it,'' said Dr. Teri Manolio, director of the epidemiology and biometry programs at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. ''It's almost gone.'' Instead, the typical patient is a man or woman of 70 or older, who survives. Statisticians at the institute calculate that if death rates were the same as those of 30 years ago, 815,000 more Americans a year would be dying of heart disease and 250,000 more of strokes.
Since then, scientists have cloned cattle and mice, and even clones of clones of mice. But pigs, Dr. Ayares said, ''certainly have been more of a challenge.'' He said the scientists had to modify every step of the process to get it to work for pigs. Like cloning in sheep and cows, Dr. Ayares said, the process is inefficient -- it can take several hundred efforts before a clone is born. To clone, scientists take a cell from an adult animal and slip it into an egg whose own genetic material has been removed. The genes of the adult cell take over the egg, directing it to divide and form an embryo. The embryo is placed in the uterus of a surrogate mother, where it grows into  a genetically identical copy, a clone, of the adult whose cell was used. The commercial value of cloning, scientists say, is as an effective way to genetically modify animals. Before the adult cell is used to start cloning, scientists could alter it. Whatever changes they make would be carried into the cloned animal.
For Charles P. Pierce, a writer-at-large for Esquire magazine, the new genetic research forced him to confront a troubling question: Did he want to know whether he, like his father and his father's four brothers, would develop Alzheimer's disease? He wanted to think that the disease was not in the genes; that way, he could avoid the weight of the past generation's experiences. Clinging to the now-discredited idea that  Alzheimer's disease is caused by aluminum,  he reminded himself that his father had been exposed to aluminum during World War II on Navy ships. ''The most prolonged exposure I had to aluminum was wrapping the leftovers in foil after dinner,'' Mr. Pierce wrote in his forthcoming book, ''Hard to Forget: An Alzheimer's Story.'' ''If it was aluminum, I was safe.'' Then he spoke to a scientist who told him bluntly: ''The idea is that you don't get Alzheimer's disease from aluminum. You get it from bad genes.''
''I don't want to be fat,'' Dr. Wurtman said. ''I don't want my clothes to be tight on me. I like the sense of looking in a mirror and not being displeased.'' Control, a Relative Term In a sense, Ms. Barton, Ms. Litman and Dr. Wurtman are lucky. With chronic dieting, they have learned to stay thin. Not everyone is able to do so, obesity researchers say. Some are simply misinformed about how to do it. Others are biologically unable to become thin -- the most they can realistically hope for is to be less fat. In recent years, an ever-accumulating body of evidence has led most obesity researchers to a troubling conclusion: except within certain narrow limits, people may  not be able to control their weight completely. Each individual, they say, inherits genes that predetermine a range of body weights -- varying about 10 percent from a midpoint, that they can maintain. The chronic dieters, through their constant vigilance, are keeping their weights as low as their genes will allow. The notion of natural weight ranges can be hard for many people to accept, obesity experts say. The idea that anyone who wants to could be thin, is ''the biggest misunderstanding in medicine,'' said Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University.
In North Carolina, Dr. Nelson reached a crisis of conscience. ''The more I started looking at these poor people with feeding tubes, the more guilty I started becoming,'' Dr. Nelson said. ''Am I sinning?'' he recalled asking himself, wondering whether it was right to stand by while patients suffered with pain and discomfort from tubes and other treatments. ''I went to medical school to alleviate suffering and I am causing suffering,'' Dr. Nelson said. ''When I die and hopefully go to heaven, God will ask me, 'Did you try everything possible?' I want to say I did.'' Last November, he introduced a position paper to his state medical society, which it passed unanimously, saying that tube feeding was not good medicine for end-stage dementia patients. He also counsels families. When Alzheimer's patients can no longer eat, Dr. Nelson said, ''My advice is to let the patient die peacefully.'' But, he added, few families are receptive, and some become angry. More often than not, the feeding tube goes in.
Maria Sanchez's own children told her they needed help with their weight. But until the family began attending an experimental weight-loss program for Mexican-American families, run by a Stanford University pediatrician, they had no idea where or how to cut back. Breakfast, for example. They ate pan dulce, a version of doughnuts, every single day. Then they discovered that the Stanford program, which labels foods red, yellow, or green, with meanings like a traffic signal's, deems pan dulce to be red. The family members quickly decided to eat cereal with skim milk in the morning. Then, to their great surprise, they discovered that all sorts of other foods that they had eaten with abandon, thinking they were not at all fattening, were actually red. Flavored low-fat yogurt, for example. ''I said, 'Come on, don't tell me it's red,' '' Mrs. Sanchez said, surprised to learn that the yogurt is loaded with calories.
In the future, years or maybe decades from now, the nascent genetic revolution will play out in ways that will transform the world. But perhaps because it is in the genes of scientists to disagree, there is no consensus on how soon or how great the changes will be. Some experts say that change, for good and ill, will most likely be swift and significant. Others say that maybe it is time for a reality check. The genome is not a simple system, and there may be a limit to what humans can figure out about how it operates. One of the people who see change coming fast is Dr. Gregory Stock, director of the Program on Medicine, Technology and Society at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''I believe that within a decade,'' Dr. Stock said, ''we will have done broad population studies associating certain genetic patterns with attributes related to health, to longevity. People will look at I.Q. They will look at everything.'' And, he said, they will act.
Dr. Rossouw responded, ''They're telling us that we chose the wrong kind of fat and that we just didn't know.'' But, he said: ''We're not stupid. We knew all that stuff.'' The investigators, he said, had long debates about whether to ask the women to reduce total fat or just saturated fat. In the end, they decided to go with total fat because the study was primarily a cancer study and the cancer data were for total fat. If the women had reduced just their saturated fat, their dietary fat content would probably have been even higher, fueling the critics. And, he said, some animal data indicate that polyunsaturated fat may even increase cancer risk. ''We looked at all possible scenarios,'' Dr. Rossouw said. But, he said, given the study's disappointing findings, he was not surprised by the critics' responses. Not everyone is attacking the study. Many scientists applaud its findings and say it is about time that some cherished dietary notions are put to a rigorous test. And some nonscientists are shocked by the reactions of the study's critics.
''It is a totally incendiary word within the community,'' Ms. Stovall said. Some who object to being called survivor want to say they are cured; others that they are living with cancer. Some want to put cancer behind them, and feel that being called a survivor is like getting an invisible brand. Frances M. Visco, president of the National Breast Cancer Coalition, an advocacy group, said her organization used the term survivor ''but only because most people accept it.'' She and others in the coalition hate it. The word survivor, she said, implies that the cancer is over. But she said that for her, the reality is that no matter how many years pass, ''you are never assured that the disease will not come back.'' Dr. Michael Gallo, an associate director at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey who recently learned he had B-cell lymphoma, says the word overly sentimentalizes a brutal experience.
FIRST, New York City schools replaced soft drinks with Snapple. Now they're banning whole milk. In 2000, Los Angeles also banished whole milk from its schools; some states are considering similar proposals. And across the country, there are anguished pleas for more nutrition education, more physical education, more anything to get children to eat less and exercise more. And why not? Children are fatter than ever. Rates of childhood obesity started rising in the 1980's, when adults' weights also began to soar. From 1976 to 1980, 5 percent of children were overweight, says Katherine Flegal, a statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics. Today, she says, 15.8 percent are overweight. Just about everyone can list ways to fight childhood obesity: schools should alter lunch menus, teach nutrition and hold more physical education classes. At home, parents should be more diligent and the Xbox less available. Here's the problem: as logical as these suggestions might sound, when many of them have been subjected to the cold light of rigorous scientific study, they have fallen short. If nothing else, when it comes to fighting obesity, science teaches humility.
But, Dr. Levy wondered, were there long-term effects of believing the stereotypes of aging? She found a study that could provide answers, the Ohio Longitudinal Study of Aging and Retirement. The two-decade-long study included 1,157 people, nearly every resident of Oxford, Ohio, who was 50 or older and was not suffering from dementia. And it had questions about beliefs about aging. It turned out that people who had more positive views about aging were healthier over time. They lived an average of 7.6 years longer than those of a similar age who did not hold such views, and even had less hearing loss when their hearing was tested three years after the study began. The result persisted when the investigators took in account the participants' health at the start of the study, as well as their age, gender, and socioeconomic status. Some like Dr. Suzman were swayed, but Dr. Hodes urges caution. As provocative as the data may be, he notes, the studies cannot tell for sure what is cause and what is effect. It may be that people who had negative attitudes about aging somehow knew that they were not really well.
Charles Baron watched for eight years as his wife, Betty, once lively and vibrant, a leader in her St. Louis community, slipped away, lost to the ravages of Alzheimer's disease. He tried everything to slow her decline -- prescription drugs, nutritional supplements, diet, exercise. ''We tried everything that the doctors have been kind enough to say is not going to harm us,'' Mr. Baron said. But his efforts were of little avail. At 79, Mrs. Baron was on a steady downhill course. She still lived at home, but Mr. Baron relied on full-time help to care for her. Then, in early April, Mr. Baron was listening to the radio and heard a news report about an Alzheimer's drug, memantine. The drug blocks a brain chemical, glutamate, which has been implicated in nerve cell death. A new study found that it seemed to have a modest effect in alleviating the symptoms of advanced Alzheimer's disease.
Patients usually do not confront doctors. Instead, most rant to friends or family members about their experiences or simply change doctors. But in most areas of the country, there is an abundance of patients. If a few patients leave a medical practice, plenty more can take their place, so doctors may never even know what their patients think. ''The reality is that a lot of these doctors don't have a source of objective comments,'' said Dr. John Freedman, the medical director for quality management at the Tufts Health Plan in Massachusetts, which includes 18,000 doctors. But now some medical groups are taking steps to address the problem, questioning patients and going so far as to dock the pay of doctors whose patients give them poor ratings. At the Rochester Independent Practice Association in New York, with 3,000 doctors, patients are surveyed, and their satisfaction scores can account for 20 percent of a doctor's pay. At Tufts Health Plan, 3,000 to 4,000 doctors had all or part of their bonuses withheld last year because their patients did not rate them highly, said Richard Lynch, the plan's vice president of network contracting.
They, along with investigators at the University of California at San Francisco, used computer modeling to screen large databases of chemicals for ones that might fit into a groove in the Apo E4 protein and modify its shape so it looks like Apo E3. They found several that looked promising. ''We are still at the cell culture level with these studies,'' Dr. Mucke said. ''But it would be one way of taking advantage of what nature already has in place. We know that this protein has a big impact on Alzheimer's disease. The idea is to take advantage of what nature is revealing to us.'' But would it work? Is there any hope that people can regain their memories after the disease process has started? The task ahead is not likely to be easy, Dr. Mucke and others caution. ''We need to look at Alzheimer's disease as a disease that is as powerful and ferocious as cancer,'' Dr. Mucke said. ''We need to fight it with equally heroic measures.'' But now, he said, ''It is beginning to look like a tractable problem.''
While all invasive breast cancer is believed to start as D.C.I.S., D.C.I.S. is often harmless. At times, it either never develops into cancer or it grows so slowly that it is not a danger during the woman's lifetime. But, unable to tell which lesions will become deadly, doctors generally treat them all. When computer-aided detection was introduced at the seven centers, the number of cancers detected did not change. But the percentage of cancers that were D.C.I.S. increased significantly, to 37.4 percent from 28.1 percent. One way of looking at the data is to say that if the point of screening is to find cancers early, before they are dangerous, then finding more D.C.I.S. is good. That is the view of Mr. Cascella of Hologic, for example. But, Dr. Fenton says, doctors had hoped computer-aided detection would find more invasive cancers that were on a road to metastasis. ''We didn't find that,'' he said.
The Amsterdam study, involving 295 women who had been treated at the Netherlands Cancer Institute, concluded that those whose tumors had good signatures -- a favorable pattern of expression of the 70 genes -- had a 94.5 percent chance of surviving for the next 10 years. Those whose tumors had bad signatures had a 54.6 percent chance of surviving that time period. If the signature is a good predictor of a cancer's lethality, that argues against a popular vision of how cancers become deadly, said the study's lead investigator, Dr. Ren√© Bernards of the Netherlands Cancer Institute. The common notion is that deadly tumors start out benign, meaning that they are unable to spread outside the breast and so are unable to kill. But as they grow, they acquire mutations that allow them to metastasize, taking up residence in places like the bones, the liver and the brain, where they can be deadly.
''No one has been able to show clearly that testosterone improves endurance,'' Bhasin said. Some athletes have said that the hormone helped in events like the Tour de France because it increased aggressiveness or allowed them to train harder. But that, too, has not been demonstrated, Bhasin said. ''It's folklore,'' he added. Despite the result of the A sample of Landis's urine test -- which showed high levels of testosterone -- it is entirely possible that he did not take the hormone. (Landis said he planned to request an analysis of the B sample today.) The test looks for a ratio of testosterone to epitestosterone, a hormone that is produced in parallel to testosterone but does not have testosterone's effects. Dr. John Amory, an endocrinologist at the University of Washington, said that men ordinarily produced one molecule of epitestosterone for every molecule of testosterone. If a man takes testosterone, he will skew his testosterone-to-epitestosterone ratio.
After months of fevered research, the scientists at Aaron Diamond discovered why Mr. Fuchs and another man with a similar experience were immune. The men had inherited a gene that results in a blocked porthole into white blood cells, preventing the virus from slipping in. The investigators isolated the gene and discovered how it worked and how many other people had it. On May 2, the research center was awarded a patent for a test to identify people who have the H.I.V.-resistance gene, allowing it to share in profits from the test. But what about Mr. Fuchs and the other man, Steve Crohn? They say they approached Aaron Diamond scientists and suggested that they be studied. They offered their blood, they participated in the research project, they helped the research center garner publicity for its discovery. ''I just wanted to do something good,'' Mr. Fuchs said. ''But once money came into the picture, why not have it be shared with me?''
''There is a real biological difference between an embryonic stem cell and a fertilized egg,'' said Dr. Brigid Hogan, a mouse embryonic stem-cell researcher at Vanderbilt University. The problem, said Dr. Green, is that people are still trying to use biology to draw moral lines in the sand, and biology just does not suffice anymore. Questions arise with cloning because any cell of the body could, in theory, be used to make a new human being, Dr. Green said. And, he added, they arise with stem cells, because the cells could become human beings with a lot less laboratory manipulation. The result, he said, is that ''the lines get very difficult to draw.'' ''People like to think that the biology is going to tell us something definitive,'' Dr. Green said. But, he added, ''The biology only poses decisions.''
The Fairfax bank also includes ''staff impressions'' of donors in its dossiers. The staff seems to have favorable impressions of everyone, but, some are more favorable than others. Among the most favorable of all is a man who appears to also be the most-requested donor. ''Women sort of fall in love with him,'' says Joy Bader, director of client services. The most-requested donor is of Colombian-Italian and Spanish ancestry, is ''very attractive, with hazel eyes and dark hair,'' and, Ms. Bader adds, is ''pursuing a Ph.D.'' The bank's files have one man, Donor 1913, who fits that description. Donor 1913, the staff notes in his file, is ''extremely attractive,'' adding in a kind of clinical swoon, ''He has a strong modelesque jaw line and sparkling hazel eyes. When he smiles, it makes you want to smile as well.'' Donor 1913 is an all-around nice guy, they say. ''He has a shy, boyish charm,'' the staff reports, ''genuine, outgoing and adventurous.''
Another way to keep an issue alive is to look for subgroups of people in large negative studies whose experience seems to support a given hypothesis. You can always find such subgroups if you slice the data, said Dr. Barnett Kramer, editor of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute. They will appear simply by chance, he said, adding that since the total effect is null, for every subgroup with a positive effect, there is another with a negative effect. That does not mean that the effect in any subgroup is real -- to find out you need to do another study just with them. Should you? Or should a study that enrolled mostly men be repeated with women? Should one involving whites be done again to see if the results are the same with blacks? ''There's no shortage of issues that can be raised,'' Dr. Gordis said. Often, he added, there is money to be found to re-do the studies with a different emphasis.
A popular operation for arthritis of the knee worked no better than a sham procedure in which patients were sedated while surgeons pretended to operate, researchers are reporting today. The operation -- arthroscopic surgery for the pain and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis -- is done on at least 225,000 middle-age and older Americans each year at a cost of more than a billion dollars to Medicare, the Department of Veterans Affairs and private insurers. It involves making three small incisions in the knee; inserting an arthroscope, a thin instrument that allows surgeons to see the joint; and then flushing debris from the knee or shaving rough areas of cartilage from the joint and then flushing it. In the study, to be published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, investigators at the Houston Veterans Affairs Medical Center and Baylor College of Medicine report that while patients often said they felt better after the surgery, their improvement was just wishful thinking. Tests of knee functions revealed that the operation had not helped, and those who got the placebo surgery reported feeling just as good as those who had had the real operation.
''Imagine how scary that was for that child,'' Dr. Weinblatt said. ''But if you had not listened to her and just talked to her about how terrible it was, and that there was such a loss of life, you would have missed it.'' Dr. Graae said that a 3-year-old girl was in his office playing while he saw her older brother. She began pushing little human figures off his desk. It turned out that the child had caught a glimpse on television of people leaping to their deaths from the World Trade Center after the planes has crashed into the towers. She was deeply upset, and this was her way of expressing it. For Muslim children, the terrorist events can be doubly frightening, said Imam Hassan Qazwini, the religious leader of the Islamic Center of America in Detroit. ''All eyes are being directed toward us, Muslims in America,'' Imam Qazwini said.
Those who needed to see gastroenterologists for other reasons often had long waits for appointments, said Dr. Douglas Rex, a gastroenterologist and professor of medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine. Gastroenterologists enjoy doing colonoscopies and believe they are important, because colon cancer is the most preventable cancer, Dr. Rex said. And, he added, there is a financial disincentive for treating patients with diseases like hepatitis or conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, which often require extensive, and poorly compensated, discussions with patients to help them cope. Now, though, the colonoscopy era may be coming to an end, the gastroenterology association's Future Trends Committee said. The panel predicted that before long, most colon cancer screening could be done by radiologists with CT scans or even by general practitioners who send stool samples off for tests looking for cancer cells. Or patients may swallow a pill containing a camera that will show images of the colon, a method that is being tested now in the upper gastrointestinal tract.
''I'm not trying to say that statistics are not important,'' Dr. Markman said. ''We can argue about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin. But these are real live patients, and it doesn't help anyone to go through this.'' It defies belief, he said, that women should forgo the only test they now have that can find breast cancer early. ''We surely find things that are small and those cancers are cured,'' he said.  BUT it is not just statistical arguments that cloud the picture, said Dr. Barron Lerner, an internist and historian of medicine at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. There is also the image of cancer as a relentless enemy that will advance unless it is conquered. It is, he said, an image of war. ''What do you do in a war?'' he said. ''You search out the enemy, then you do what you can to surround and destroy the enemy. Cancer is the enemy and mammography is the tool we use to search it out.''
The lack of this knowledge, Dr. McGowan said, often leads to bad practice. For example, she said, doctors should routinely evaluate people over 50 who break a bone, for any reason, to see if they have osteoporosis. But such evaluations are seldom ordered. Doctors should also make sure that older people get enough vitamin D, because deficiencies greatly increase fracture risk, Dr. McGowan said. But this, too, is rarely done. Osteoporosis, the most common bone disease, is grimly serious, afflicting 10 million Americans over age 50 annually. Each year, the report found, about 1.5 million Americans break bones because of osteoporosis, costing the health care system $18 billion. Often, the bone that is broken is the hip. And a hip fracture can set off a spiral leading to a nursing home and death: 20 percent of people who break a hip die within a year, the report said. Osteoporosis can be prevented and treated with drugs that keep bones from breaking down -- if people realize that they have it.
From 1995 to 1998, the most recent year for which national data are available, in vitro fertilization procedures increased by 37 percent, from about 59,000 to about 81,000, and the number of clinics rose by 28 percent, from 281 to 360. But most of the business goes to a few highly successful clinics, leaving the others to fight over the remainders. Since fertility became a specialty nearly 20 years ago, the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology trained so many fertility specialists that ''they flooded the market,'' said Dr. Richard Rawlins, laboratory director for the Rush Centers for Advanced Reproductive Care in Chicago. Improved methods and competition caused prices for in vitro fertilization to drop precipitously, from highs of about $18,000 in the late 1980's to lows of about $4,500 today, he said. Insurance companies in a few states started paying. The result was more patients, more doctors and more and more competition.
For example, doctors at Hackensack were keeping pneumonia patients in the hospital, receiving intravenous antibiotics, for one to two weeks when many could go home within days with antibiotic pills, avoiding the discomfort from the intravenous lines and the ensuing risk of infection. By putting a nurse on the case, patients were sent home sooner. The hospital saved $500,000 a year by refilling its beds with other patients. Medicare, which pays most of the bill for pneumonia patients, reimburses for a diagnosis -- pneumonia -- and not for the number of days a patient spends in the hospital, so keeping patients in the hospital longer costs money. Of course, the economics of medical care are rarely simple and the new programs have so far steered clear of the most difficult category: medical care that is useless or unnecessary, a category that costs the nation hundreds of billions of dollars a year.
''If we want to understand the genetic basis'' for dangerous flu strains, ''this is the way we should be going,'' Dr. Jeffery Taubenberger of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology said of the researchers' approach. Dr. Linda Lambert, the influenza program officer at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, ''What is really surprising and kind of made people sit up straight is that what allows the virus to go from nonlethal to lethal may be only a few genes.'' The message, said Dr. John Oxford, a flu expert who is a professor of virology at St. Bartholomew's and the Royal London Hospital, is that ''rather small changes in vital places can make the difference between life and death, as it were.'' The question of what makes a flu virus turn deadly is of enormous concern to public health officials, who still shudder at what they consider a near miss of a vast epidemic  in Hong Kong in 1997.
Cortland's cross-country team had not won a race in seven years. So Dr. Costill began searching for interested students who might turn out to be good runners, and he turned up three who were so good they ended up as all-Americans. One, Bob Fitts, a muscular former football player who had been in the Army, went on to become an exercise physiologist and is now a professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee. Dr. Costill was puzzled. All the runners trained in the same way. But, he said, ''One guy was the national champion and another guy would be lucky to finish the race.'' He wanted to find out why, but since Cortland was not a research institution, he soon realized that he had to go elsewhere. With his newly earned Ph.D., he began looking for jobs. One day, he got an envelope in the mail with no return address. Inside was a newspaper advertisement for a job directing a new center, the Human Performance Laboratory at Ball State. He applied and was hired.
And the Union Army was not very picky. ''Incontinence of urine alone is not grounds for dismissal,'' said Dora Costa, an M.I.T. economist who works with Dr. Fogel, quoting from the regulations. A man who was blind in his right eye was disqualified from serving because that was his musket eye. But, Dr. Costa said, ''blindness in the left eye was O.K.'' After the war ended, as the veterans entered middle age, they were rarely spared chronic ailments. ''In the pension records there were descriptions of hernias as big as grapefruits,'' Dr. Costa said. ''They were held in by a truss. These guys were continuing to work although they clearly were in a lot of pain. They just had to cope.'' Eighty percent had heart disease by the time they were 60, compared with less than 50 percent today. By ages 65 to 74, 55 percent of the Union Army veterans had back problems. The comparable figure today is 35 percent.
A large study of vitamin E and heart disease found that it did not prevent heart attacks and that people taking it had more strokes. Another study, of women with heart disease, found that antioxidant vitamins might actually increase the rate of atherosclerosis. Dr. Caballero said people were deluding themselves if they thought multivitamins could make up for poor diets. ''If you eat junk food every day, vitamins are the least of your problems,'' he said. ''You cannot replace a healthy diet. We don't know what ingredient in a healthy diet is responsible for which condition. We do know that people who consume five servings or more of fruits and vegetables have less disease. But we don't know which ingredient. We tried beta carotene, vitamin E and antioxidants, and they didn't work. ''People are looking for the magic bullet. It does not exist.'' Correction:  May 1, 2003, Thursday  An article in Science Times on Tuesday about overconsumption of vitamin supplements misstated the view of Dr. Eric Topol, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic. He said he would recommend folic acid only for people with very high levels of homocysteine, not low levels.
When Sally Morrison and Paul Corser of Manhattan decided that they wanted to have a baby, they went to local fertility doctors for help. But everywhere they went they were turned down, for Mr. Corser was infected with H.I.V. ''Literally, someone said to me, 'We don't help people like you,' '' Ms. Morrison recalled. It took the couple three years, until 1998, to find a clinic in the United States that would. Many clinics still will not help couples like them, who arrive there in a quandary: if the men, with H.I.V., have unprotected sex, they risk infecting their partners and their babies. Yet if the men use condoms, they are infertile. But with sophisticated fertility methods, they hope, it should be possible to minimize the risk by separating sperm from the virus, which is in the seminal fluid. Only in February did the ethics committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the specialists' professional group, say it was acceptable to offer such services. Several states -- including California, Florida and Illinois -- prevent doctors from using H.I.V.-infected semen in attempts at insemination.
Kathy Boston, a 53-year-old dental assistant who lives in Oakland, Calif., said she was relieved that she refused to take hormones because of concerns about the side effects. Even though her doctor offered her free samples of hormones about a year ago, they have been sitting in a drawer ever since, she said. ''When I get hot flashes, I open the window,'' Ms. Boston said. Betty Young, who is 60 and lives in Oakland, said she did not take the drugs, but added that she had no confidence in studies like these. ''I get so disgusted,'' Ms. Young said. ''This month they say it's bad for you; next month they say it's good for you. If you're going to get breast cancer, you get it.'' Some women are undaunted by the new findings, said Dr. Mary Jacobson, an obstetrician-gynecologist at Stanford. ''The patients with whom I spoke on hormonal therapy were pretty defiant about staying on it,'' she said, adding that as for the breast cancer link, those patients ''think it does not apply to them.''
The research on the 1918 virus is directly applicable to current concerns, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in a joint statement. ''The new studies could have an immediate impact by helping scientists focus on detecting changes in the evolving H5N1 virus that might make widespread transmission among humans more likely,'' they said. The bird flu viruses now prevalent share some of the crucial genetic changes that occurred in the 1918 flu, scientists said, but not all. The scientists suspect that with the 1918 flu, changes in just 25 to 30 out of about 4,400 amino acids in the viral proteins turned the virus into a killer. The new work also reveals that 1918 virus acts much differently from ordinary human flu viruses. It infects cells deep in the lungs of mice and infects lung cells, like the cells lining air sacs, that would normally be impervious to flu. And while other human flu viruses do not kill mice, this one, like today's bird flus, does.
Dr. Jacques Cohen, the scientific director of assisted reproduction at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., said that if he did not know about the difficulty researchers had trying to clone monkeys, he would have thought that humans would be easy to clone because fertility experts have spent years perfecting techniques to handle human eggs in the laboratory and to grow human embryos for a few days in a lab. But the monkey work, he said, gave him pause. Dr. Dominko, one of the principal researchers trying to clone monkeys, spent three years, and made more than 300 attempts, to no avail. Working at the Oregon Primate Research Center, at a well-financed laboratory, she and her colleagues never got a single pregnancy. Instead, the cloning efforts produced grotesquely abnormal embryos, some with cells with no chromosomes, some with multiple nuclei, including one cell had nine nuclei. She called the embryos her ''gallery of horrors.''
Dr. Gerald D. Fischbach, who was director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, which sponsored the study, said that while the operation had been promoted by some neurosurgeons as miraculous, this was the first time it was rigorously evaluated. It used sham surgery as a comparison, a controversial and rarely used strategy but one that researchers felt was necessary to understand the true effects of the operation. Dr. Fischbach, who is now dean of the faculty of medicine at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, was the director of the institute only at the end of the study. ''Ad hoc reports of spectacular results can always occur,'' Dr. Fischbach said. ''But if you do these studies systematically, this is the result you get.'' The surgery, he added, ''is not the final solution that people would have hoped going into it.'' In the study, researchers, led by Dr. Curt R. Freed of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver and Dr. Stanley Fahn of the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, recruited 40 patients, ages 34 to 75, who had had Parkinson's disease for an average of 14 years. The patients were randomly assigned to have substantia nigra cells from four fetuses implanted in their brains or to have sham surgery, for comparison.
It remains a puzzle why estrogen, which can fuel the growth of many breast cancers, did not increase the breast cancer risk in this study. Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at Stanford and chairwoman of the study's steering committee, proposed two hypotheses. First, Dr. Stefanick said, most of the women in the study were fat. After menopause, fat is a main source of estrogen, and it may be that the women were already making so much that the estrogen in the pills did not add to their risk. Another possibility, she said, involves the form of estrogen -- the women took a pill, Premarin, containing hormones from pregnant horses. It consists of a complex mixture of hormones, some of which mimic human estrogen. And so, Dr. Stefanick said, it is possible that Premarin contains hormones that protected against cancer as well as ones that spurred its growth, effectively leading to a neutral effect.
Was it genetic destiny or health habits that caused her mother's heart disease? Mrs. Keller asks herself. Her mother smoked for more than a decade, finally quitting with great difficulty before Mrs. Keller was born. ''She said the Lord helped her,'' Mrs. Keller said. Mrs. Keller has never smoked. Concerned about heart disease, she had her cholesterol level tested a few years ago and now takes medication to lower it. She walks at lunch with the women in her office and after dinner with her husband. Her daughter Rachel, petite and quiet with a quick smile, is already thinking about her family's medical history. She worries about heart disease, worries about lung disease. She has already had her cholesterol level measured -- it was normal. And she is shocked when people her age start smoking. ''In high school, none of my friends smoked,'' she said. ''They came back from their first year in college, and all of them did.''
Nevertheless, some doctors say testosterone deficiency is a real medical condition that needs treatment. ''To say it doesn't exist is to put your head in the sand,'' said Dr. Larry Lipshultz, a professor of urology at Baylor College of Medicine. ''The question on the table is, Can we prescribe this medication enthusiastically without having good controlled studies? ''My response is that I am still going to use this drug,'' he went on. ''There is no reason to withhold treatment from patients with symptoms and lab reports of low testosterone levels because someone has not done a placebo-controlled study.'' The quest to use so-called testicular extracts as a fountain of youth began with a memorable experiment. On June 1, 1889, a 72-year-old French physiologist, Charles √âdouard Brown-S√©quard, reported to spellbound doctors at a medical meeting that he had injected himself with a substance extracted from the testicles of dogs and guinea pigs. The injections, he said, ''had increased his physical strength and intellectual energy, relieved his constipation and even lengthened the arc of his urine,'' said Dr. John Hoberman, a historian of science at the University of Texas.
In theory, scientists could stop A beta production by blocking either the beta- or the gamma-secretase. But both enzymes were elusive. ''The problem,'' Dr. Citron said, ''is that there are multiple proteases, and in making cell extracts, you release all of the proteases. It is very hard to sort out which are relevant.'' Several large drug companies decided to go ahead anyway, even without the beta-secretase or the gamma-secretase in hand. Instead, they studied cells in the laboratory that released A beta protein and looked for drugs that would prevent the substance from being released. Dr. Citron and his colleagues decided to take a different tack: to look for the gene that directs cells to make beta-secretase. In a long and tedious set of experiments that began in 1997, they began a process of progressive elimination, searching first for a string of about 100 genes that contained the one they wanted, then narrowing the gene strings to batches of 20 and, finally, homing in on the gene. With the gene in hand, they could use it to make the enzyme and show that the enzyme cut the large precursor protein at exactly the right spot and at no other spot.
At the medical center, Dr. Bianchi says, her foray into the world of stem cell research involved a decade of discoveries so unexpected that despite her stellar reputation, colleagues at first looked askance. Dr. Bianchi, who works in a lab stretched out along a narrow corridor of an old building that was once a garment factory, stumbled into the field when she was trying to find a new method of prenatal diagnosis. She knew that a few fetal cells enter a woman's blood during pregnancy and hoped to extract those cells for prenatal diagnosis. That proved too difficult because there are so few fetal cells in maternal blood. But then she discovered that the fetal cells do not disappear when a pregnancy ends. Instead, they remain in a woman's body for decades, perhaps indefinitely. And if a woman's tissues or organs are injured, fetal cells from her baby migrate there, divide and turn into the needed cell type, be it thyroid or liver, intestine or gallbladder, cervix or spleen.
But the emergency contraception pills are not universally accepted. While most public health experts and doctors say the pills are contraceptives, not abortion-inducing drugs, because they work before a fertilized egg has implanted itself in the uterus, some abortion opponents disagree. The National Right to Life Committee, for example, asked to comment on the pills, sent a fax saying that as far as it is concerned, once an egg is fertilized, a human life has begun. And most pharmacies in Washington, including Mrs. Schaefer's, have no signs advertising emergency contraception. ''There could be some controversy,'' Mrs. Schaefer explained. But, said Elise Wells, a public health advocate who helped start the Washington project and is now starting the one in Alaska, there has been little outcry in Washington from opponents. ''There had been concern that there would be protests and pickets, but that has not happened,'' Ms. Wells said. Public health advocates say the pill could provide enormous benefits.
The obesity researchers say they are not trying to be contrarians. They simply are asking a fundamental question that has gotten lost in the growing cries of alarm over the fattening of America. Is obesity, they ask, a symptom or a disease? Some strongly suspect it is a symptom. And losing weight, they say, may be suppressing the symptom but doing little or nothing for the underlying illness, just as taking aspirin for a fever may do nothing for the sickness that had fever as a symptom. Moreover, obesity experts add, not every person with the symptom of obesity necessarily has a disease that can increase that person's chances of an early death. ''People should be very, very careful in thinking about obesity and health,'' said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, the director of the division of molecular genetics at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. Dr. Leibel said his own years of experience studying fat people had convinced him that many had none of the common risk factors that went along with the condition -- high blood sugar levels, high blood pressure and high cholesterol levels.
But, he said, he uses a cell phone and continues to do so. And, he said, he tells his brain cancer patients not to worry about using the phones. Scientists said a study from Denmark, to be published soon in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, provided equally reassuring news. Danish researchers identified thousands of cell-phone users from telephone company records, then reviewed medical records to examine if any association existed between use of the device and development of brain cancers. They found none. Some scientists were not surprised. Dr. Eleanor R. Adair, a senior scientist at the Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio who has studied the effects of microwave radiation on animals and people, said the sort of microwave radiation used to transmit cell-phone signals had not caused damage in long-term studies and had  not injured cells in repeatable laboratory studies. There is no biological reason to expect it to cause cancer, Dr. Adair said.
For example, Dr. Cleeman said: ''If you have someone who starts at an L.D.L. level of 115, don't just give a small dose of a statin to get it to 99. Give a dose for a 30 to 40 percent reduction.'' Perhaps the report's most surprising recommendation concerns the goal that doctors might set for L.D.L. levels in their patients at highest risk, those with established heart disease plus another condition like diabetes, smoking, high blood pressure or a recent heart attack. For those patients, the report said, there is a therapeutic option to drive the L.D.L. level to a breathtakingly low level -- below 70. The term, ''therapeutic option,'' was used, Dr. Cleeman said, because while the advice was suggested by recent clinical trials, the evidence was not quite ironclad. ''The evidence is quite strong,' he said, ''but it is just short of being definitive where you would say, 'Thou shalt.'''
On the other hand, many had the same side effects that afflicted Dr. Papadakis's subjects. Although they went away when the subjects stopped taking growth hormone, they gave the investigators pause. The American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine said in a statement that the doses used in the study were far too high. Lower doses that reproduce the hormone levels of youth are safe and effective, the group said. But Dr. Papadakis said those were the levels her study reproduced. ''Maybe we don't know the right dose,'' she said. ''But then how can you be giving it to people? Get a grip.'' Dr. Livesey and Dr. Raffaele, at the Anti-Aging Medicine clinic in Manhattan, had expected most of their patients to be old people trying to gain enough strength to rise from a chair unassisted, or middle-aged people wanting to look young. Instead, they tend to be baby boomers, the doctors said, who are searching for something that other doctors did not provide.
The second strategy was for the respirators to provide less oxygen, even though many patients would become ''air hungry'' -- wanting more breath. In addition, Dr. Brower said, with less oxygen going into the lungs, carbon dioxide can build up in the blood, causing its own problems and making patients feel worse. ''If carbon dioxide accumulates, it contributes to the distress the patient feels,'' Dr. Brower said. ''It can make the heart beat faster, sometimes fast enough to make it a concern.'' Frantic for breath, with pounding hearts, some patients have to be sedated, he added. Still, the study showed that while nearly 40 percent of the patients who received large volumes of air died, just 31 percent of those receiving less air died. ''This is massively important,'' said Dr. Thomas Stewart, the director of the intensive care unit at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who did not participate in the Federal study. Family members, he said, should be aware ''that the way their physicians are managing the patients makes a difference to their outcomes.'' They need to be sure that the doctors are setting the respirators to provide less air and gentler pressure in the lungs, he said.
The results in Long Island were consistent with previous studies. For example, a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1997, involving 32,826 nurses, also found no evidence that DDT and PCB's increase the risk of breast cancer. The next year, Dr. David Hunter, director of the Harvard Center for Cancer Prevention, and his colleagues published a paper in The Journal of the National Cancer Institute that pulled together data from five studies involving 1,600 women. Again no link between exposure to the chemicals and breast cancer was found. ''I think we have the answers for these chemicals,'' Dr. Hunter said. BUT what if the risks are very small and the exposures took place in the distant past? Then, Dr. Gammon said, it can stretch the limits of science to try to find an association. ''In some areas of science we can do wonderful things,'' Dr. Gammon said. ''But there are still some very basic things we can't do. We don't have accurate ways to measuring pollutants from a long time ago.''
The challenge, then, was to figure out how the immune system normally suppressed the AIDS virus and then to enhance that natural weapon. The goal would be to make the immune system so effective that the virus would be kept at even lower levels and suppressed for even longer times. The key, it turned out, was the killer T-cells, also known as CD8 cells. These white blood cells attack viruses in a completely different way than antibodies attack them. Instead of looking for the virus itself, killer T-cells look for cells that are infected with a virus. When a cell is infected with a virus, like the AIDS virus, it puts fragments of viral proteins on its surface, like flags signaling distress. Killer T-cells, cruising by in the bloodstream, are drawn to those flags, kill the infected cells and start to proliferate into an army that will search for other cells with the same flags and kill them.
The final version was almost bland, calling the quest ''a very meaningful study'' and ''this important study.'' The men were told, ''Your contribution to the project may help not only yourself but also many others who might have persistent hepatitis C or who will become infected in the future.'' Finally, on Feb. 1 the letters went out by Federal Express. Two days later, the first man called. Within a week, Dr. Seeff had heard from all eight. All but one, who had had a stroke, were willing to be examined. The three men tested so far are still infected with hepatitis C, Dr. Seeff said. Mr. Woodland was the first to come in for testing and his results were totally unexpected. They showed 3.18 million copies of the hepatitis C virus in his blood and slightly abnormal liver enzymes, indicating an infection. ''I am more amazed by this than by almost anything I have ever seen,'' Dr. Seeff said. ''This man has had 50 years of infection,'' he said. Yet, he continued, Mr. Woodland seems to have simply lived with the virus, with no signs of illness.
''All the benefits were in the estrogen receptor negatives,'' Dr. Berry said. ''Then I asked, What is going on here?'' he continued. The answer, he and his colleagues report in the new paper, is that hormone therapies with drugs like tamoxifen that starve cancers of estrogen are so powerful -- reducing the death rate by 30 percent in women with estrogen receptor positive tumors -- that chemotherapy helps those women much less than it helps women with estrogen receptor negative tumors. On average, the researchers report, a women whose cancer does not respond to estrogen has a 23 percent greater chance of surviving five years, disease free, if she has chemotherapy. For a woman whose cancer is fed by estrogen, chemotherapy increases her chance of surviving that long by 7 percent, which is not statistically significant. ''To me, what that means is that as we approach decisions about chemotherapy, we have to think very differently for women with estrogen receptor negative cancers than for those with estrogen receptor positive cancers,'' Dr. Winer said.
Over the years, groups like the Institute of Medicine, which reviewed data, concluded that there was no conclusive evidence linking the implants to serious diseases. In the meantime, Inamed approached the F.D.A. about returning to the marketplace and began studies it hoped would satisfy the agency's concerns. The company said in its Internet Webcast that it had more data than it submitted in its application, including some that might help satisfy the F.D.A.'s new guidelines. Groups that had opposed the marketing of implants praised the agency's decision. ''We're delighted, we're absolutely delighted,'' Ms. Pearson said. ''They balanced it just perfectly,'' she said of the F.D.A. ''They sent a message that the current implants don't have enough safety data for women to make an informed decision yet at the same time they said, we want implants but we want safe and effective implants. That's as good as it gets.'' Dr. Scott Spear, a plastic surgeon at Georgetown University who is a consultant to Inamed, asserted that the F.D.A.'s decision should not be interpreted as a rejection of the product or a judgment on its safety.
The problem is that Galzin is zinc acetate, and zinc acetate is sold both as a prescription drug and over the counter as a food supplement. The supplement and the drug are supposed to be the same, but the supplement is not licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, so its manufacture is not regulated and there is no guarantee that the dose on the package is correct. Humana questioned why it should pay for a prescription drug when the supplement  was available. A month's supply of Galzin costs $95, Mr. Kovarik said. If he bought the supplement, it would cost $10 to $15, he said. ''We do not cover nutritional supplements,'' said Valerie Kennedy, a Humana spokeswoman. But cost is not the crucial issue, said officials at Teva Pharmaceuticals U.S.A. of Sellersville, Pa., which makes Galzin. ''The real issue here is the safety of the patient,'' said Dr. Carole Ben-Maimon, a senior vice president. ''The patients taking a prescription product know what they are getting and how it was made.''
But memories have faded over the decades. Now, doctors say, many of their pregnant patients have never heard of the drug. That means that if Bendectin does return, it may come in as a fresh product to a generation that has no prejudice against it, medical experts said. Eric Gervais, Duchesnay's executive vice president, is optimistic that he will get the drug agency's approval to market his generic version of Bendectin. Mr. Gervais said he was confident that the drug would sell as well in the United States as it had in Canada. There, he said, each year the company sells 70,000 bottles of Diclectin, each containing 100 pills. ''North America is indeed in need of this product,'' Mr. Gervais said. Dr. Anthony Scialli, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Georgetown University School of Medicine, agreed. ''There's a huge amount of safety data on Bendectin,'' Dr. Scialli said. ''It was the best studied medication in pregnancy of all time -- not just for nausea and vomiting, but the best studied, period.''
Dr. Oliver said he was surprised that the proposed link between obesity and auto fatalities was taken so seriously. But he said he realized that ''an association that is dedicated to the study of obesity presumes that obesity is a problem.'' Dr. Louis Aronne, the association's president, said there was no reason to single out obesity researchers for such criticism. ''I would say the same things about any professional association -- the diabetes association, the heart association, the cancer society,'' said Dr. Aronne, who also directs the weight loss clinic at Weill-Cornell Medical College in New York and is a scientific adviser to Metabolic Therapeutics and Manhattan Pharmaceuticals, two companies developing obesity drugs. ''We're doing what every organization does,'' Dr. Aronne said, ''and this is what we believe -- that obesity is a problem.'' One leading obesity researcher, Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly, an endocrinologist at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England, focuses on the extremely obese, even though he knows they are a small group, and that the drug industry would like to find a fat cure to sell to the masses.
''What we have to avoid is getting into the business of deciding for people what the benefit is,'' Dr. Miller said. ''The person who wants the surgery has to go through the risk-benefit exercise in their own mind. A large amount of latitude has to be given to people to decide for themselves.''
It may be that fewer spores are required, especially if they are treated to float in the air and penetrate the lungs. And there may be characteristics of the patients, like whether they are smokers, that are important. On the other hand, it is impossible to know how many spores people inhaled and how many other people may have inhaled spores and not become ill. The anthrax cases also show that there is no early warning system that such a bioterrorism attack is under way, Dr. Neill said. The first sign is that someone, like Mr. Stevens in Florida, becomes gravely ill. ''I think we have to acknowledge that,'' Dr. Neill said. The recent case of Joseph P. Curseen Jr., a 47-year-old Washington postal worker who died of anthrax, provided another lesson. Mr. Curseen, who worked at the Brentwood Road sorting center,  went to the emergency room of the Southern Maryland Hospital Center on Saturday night, Oct. 20, but was sent home with medications for nausea and diarrhea. On Monday, after he collapsed and returned to the hospital in an ambulance, attempts to save his life failed.
If only it were so simple, chronic dieters say. Mary Litman began dieting years ago, when she was 20. She remembers the moment she resolved to lose weight, at the end of a date with a good-looking young man. He walked her to her door, she recalled, and said, ''It's a good thing you have a pretty face because you're really fat.'' Ms. Litman was 5 foot 2 and weighed 125 pounds. Her date was right, she decided. All that oblivious eating of cakes and pies that her mother, a farmer's wife, had made for the family had taken their toll. ''I was farm-girl fat -- pretty, but chubby,'' Ms. Litman said. She began a life of dieting, first losing about 10 pounds, then learning to maintain it. She walks at least four miles a day, makes deliberate food choices and bargains with herself in a constant internal conversation. The other day, for example, one of the women in her office at the University of Pittsburgh Health System, where she is an administrative coordinator, brought in homemade cannoli.
''The difference was just amazing,'' he said of the two scans. ''With the angiogram, I was in the cath lab, lying on the table, unclothed, with a catheter in my groin, and then I had to lie down for eight hours of recuperation. ''With the CT, I went downstairs, they put an I.V. in my arm, I took off my shirt, lay down, and within 15 minutes I was back at work,'' Dr. O'Neill said. His blood vessels, he added, were fine. Dr. O'Neill said he too is concerned about overuse. But his experience -- having a CT scan though he had no symptoms of heart disease -- is exactly what worries doctors who fear it will lead to unneeded treatments. If scans were used for people at risk for heart disease, almost everyone would be a candidate, Dr. Topol said. About 75 percent of adult Americans have risk factors for heart disease. Most middle-aged people have narrowed areas in their arteries.
For Dr. Alam, it meant that ''your buddy has to stop the bleeding, not the medic, not the surgeon.'' So he turned to QuikClot, a product made of the mineral zeolite and sold over the counter by Z-Medica. It looks like cat litter but, sprinkled on a wound, it absorbs water from blood, concentrating the body's own clotting factors and speeding up the formation of a clot. Z-Medica has supplied 50,000 doses to the military. Dr. Alam and his colleagues tested the substance on 36 Yorkshire swine, which are close to a person's size. The results have not been published, but Dr. Alam said QuikClot converted wounds that were 100 percent fatal into wounds that were 100 percent nonfatal -- clots formed and none of the animals died. Although the Marine Corps plans to use it, other branches of the military are not yet convinced. The question is whether to use it, and at what dose. One concern is that heat is generated when QuikClot is poured on a wound, and the fear is that it might burn tissue. ''We don't have a huge amount of data,'' Dr. Alam said. ''We've done two studies.''
A new study finds that estrogen replacement therapy, which doctors have long hoped will prevent heart disease in postmenopausal women, does nothing to slow the disease's progression in those whose arteries have already been partly blocked by it. The study is being reported in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. But another study, in the same issue, cites the hormone therapy as a factor -- along with beneficial diet, exercise and avoidance of tobacco -- in the decline of heart disease among women. An editorial accompanying the studies says women will not know whether hormone therapy protects the heart until larger studies are completed in several years. As many as 10 million American women take estrogen replacement therapy; Premarin, an estrogen made by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, is the nation's best-selling prescription drug. The drug was approved for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, like hot flashes, and for the management of osteoporosis, but there has also been a widespread belief among doctors and women that it will protect against heart disease, the leading killer of American women. Heart disease is rare among premenopausal women, but its incidence begins rising in middle age.
Dr. Louis G. Lange, a cardiologist and the chief executive of a small biotechnology company, has a new drug that, if approved, will be the first new treatment for angina in a quarter-century. Like many drug companies, Dr. Lange's, CV Therapeutics of Palo Alto, Calif., tested its new product overseas, where studies go faster because it is easy to find patients who are eager to participate. But the company's testing is nearing its end, and Dr. Lange is faced with an ethical quandary: Is his company obliged to make the drug available to the patients in poor countries like Russia who took part in the studies? As companies increasingly test new drugs in other countries, they are struggling to decide what, if anything, they owe the patients who served as test subjects. Some companies have chosen not to sell their drugs in the countries where they were tested; others have marketed their drugs there, but few patients in those countries can afford them.
Last May, a stunning research paper in Science, one of the world's most respected scientific journals, instantly changed the tenor of the debate over cloning human embryos and extracting their stem cells. A team of South Korean scientists reported in the paper that they had figured out how to do this work so efficiently that the great hope of researchers and patients -- to obtain stem cells that were an exact match of a patient's -- seemed easily within sight. But that rosy future has been cast into doubt with the statement last month by Dr. Hwang Woo Suk, who led the team that wrote the paper, that it contained fabricated evidence. Questions have also been raised about earlier research and a new debate has begun. Scientists and ethicists caution that the full story is not in, but they are staggered by how the research has unraveled so far. ''This is a tragic turn,'' said Laurie Zoloth, director of the Center for Bioethics, Science and Society at Northwestern University. Stressing that she considers Dr. Hwang innocent until proven guilty, she asked, however, whether the edifice of stem cell research was built on sand.
The lead investigator on the study, Dr. Marilie D. Gammon, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina's School of Public Health, said she never alluded to a Long Island breast cancer epidemic in applying for the grant. Writing in her 1994 application, she said that the Long Island rates from 1987 until 1989 were ''generally comparable to the SEER rates,'' referring to national rates reported by the National Cancer Institute in its Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. That pattern continues, with rates that are slightly higher than the national average but typical for the Northeast. But that was not the perception of many who who lobbied for the study. Geri Barish, the president of 1 in 9: The Long Island Breast Cancer Action Coalition, recalled her first news conference in 1991: ''I said, 'I have just come from the Breast Cancer Capital of the World, and that is Long Island.' ''
The advisory committee heard entreaties from women who said that silicone implants had made them ill and ruined their lives and from women who said that they needed silicone implants for breast reconstruction after cancer or because they wanted larger breasts. But the implants, which women and doctors say look and feel more natural than the saline-filled ones that are now on the market, have been largely unavailable since 1992, when the F.D.A. asked manufacturers to withdraw them voluntarily. Women and their lawyers were charging that implants caused serious diseases and the agency determined that safety data were lacking. In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of women claimed that implants made them ill, with disabling diseases that included cancer, autoimmune and neurological disorders and chronic fatigue syndrome. Lawsuits drove one implant maker, Dow Corning, into bankruptcy and forced it and other companies to set up a multibillion dollar fund to compensate women whom the implant makers had always argued were not sickened by the devices in the first place.
''The nice thing about synapses is that they are very plastic,'' said Dr. Lennart Mucke of the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease and the University of California at San Francisco. ''As long as the cell body is intact, nerve cells have a remarkable ability to rebuild their synapses. It is much harder and often impossible to replace whole nerve cells. But if we could interfere with synaptic damage early on, there is a very good chance that cognitive function would come back.'' In a sense, researchers say, the evidence has been staring at them for years. It began with a puzzle about the defining feature of Alzheimer's, amyloid plaques, those microscopic patches of debris found in the brain. The plaques, made up of large aggregates of amyloid protein, are unmistakable, pathologists say. They look like tiny stars, about a tenth the thickness of a hair and about five to six times as large as a brain cell.
The Swedish scientists, she noted, said that the chemical might be produced naturally in the body, raising the question of whether the acrylamide in foods would be a cancer hazard. Dr. Elizabeth M. Whelan, who is president of the American Council on Science and Health, a public health group financed by foundations, trade associations, companies and individuals, noted that many foods contained substances that cause cancer in rodents. Cherry tomatoes have benzaldehyde, caffeic acid, hydrogen peroxide, quercetin and glycosides, she said, and broccoli has allyl isothocyanate. But consumption of tomatoes and broccoli have been reported to reduce cancer risk. When it comes to acrylamide, however, several scientists said the Swedish results, released by Dr. Leif Busk and Dr. Karl-Erik Hellenas of the Swedish government's National Food Administration in Uppsala, raised more questions than they answered. The scientists tested few samples and had results that ranged widely. In 15 samples of breakfast cereals, for example, the concentration of acrylamide went from undetectable to more than 1,400 micrograms per kilogram. In 14 samples of potato chips, it went from 330 to 2,300 micrograms per kilogram. The Swedish scientists said that their study indicates that Swedes, on average, consume about 40 micrograms per day of acrylamide.
While the professor, like most men, felt he had to do something about his cancer as soon as possible, medical experts say, in fact, that there is often no urgency with prostate cancer. According to Dr. Albert G. Mulley Jr., an internist at Massachusetts General who studies medical decision making, the time between when a tumor is discovered in the prostate and when it grows large enough to escape the gland -- if it grows that large at all -- can be years. That means that most men have a lot of time to make up their minds about what, if anything, to do about their tumor. A man who is 75 or older may want to do nothing, especially if he has another chronic disease, like heart disease, that may kill him in the next 10 years. ''That is when the conservative approaches deserve serious consideration,'' said Dr. Peter C. Albertsen, a urologist at the University of Connecticut Health Center. Younger men, he added, are a different story. Their options may be determined by how aggressive their tumor appears to be.
He and his colleague, Dr. Peter C. Gotzsche, decided to revisit the phenomenon, using more up-to-date research methods. They searched the world's publications for well-designed studies that included not just a placebo group but a group that got no treatment. They found 114, which involved about 7,500 patients with 40 different conditions. When they analyzed the data, they concluded that patients given nothing improved just as much as those given placebos. Their conclusion, that the placebo effect is nothing more than a medical legend, has presented doctors, scientists and the public with sort of a Rorschach test on their faith in a mind-body connection. (Come to think of it, that may not be the right analogy -- psychologists have increasingly said that the notion that the inkblots reveal character traits is, ahem, a myth.) The idea that the mind can control symptoms and disease can be immensely appealing, said Dr. Clement McDonald, a professor of medicine at Indiana University. ''Everyone wants it to be so,'' he said. ''It gives them control.'' Dr. John C. Bailar III, an emeritus professor at the University of Chicago, said: ''It's a secular religion. And as a religion, no kind of evidence is going to get believers to change their minds.''
But by chance, as endoscopies waned, a new test surged. This time, the focus was on the other end of the intestinal tract, the colon. By the late 1990s, people over age 50 were reporting to their doctors for screening colonoscopies, in which a gastroenterologist would thread a scope into the colon to look for cancer or for polyps, which can turn into cancer. Medical groups recommended colon cancer screening. In 2001, Medicare said it would pay for the tests. And suddenly, gastroenterologists were doing colonoscopies almost full time. The number of colonoscopies among Medicare recipients increased by 42 percent from 2000, when Medicare would pay only if patients were likely to have polyps or cancer, to 2002, when Medicare agreed to pay for colonoscopies as a screening test. In 2000, Medicare paid for 2,211,925 colonoscopies; by 2002 the figure had risen to 3,150,738. Soon, demand was so great that no matter how many colonoscopies doctors did, there were long lines of patients waiting to be screened.
Dr. Hlatky noted that not just hospitals were different on weekends. Patients are different, too. Other studies have found that weekend heart attack patients are sicker and waited longer before going to hospitals. The time is limited, a few hours at most, from the beginning of a heart attack to when it is too late for angioplasty to save a life. The new study did not include data on the severity of the heart attacks, how sick patients were or how long they waited before going to hospitals. Dr. Hlatky said there were indications that weekend and weekday patients in the study were different. ''More patients per day were admitted on the weekends compared with weekdays,'' Dr. Hlatky said. ''And they were significantly different in age, sex and rate of complications. There clearly is a difference in the patients admitted to the hospital on the weekend with a heart attack.
A widely promoted lung operation for emphysema, so expensive that some predicted it would bankrupt Medicare, did not help a group of the sickest patients in a large, ongoing federal study, researchers are reporting. The findings from the study will be published in The New England Journal of Medicine on Oct. 11, but the journal made them public yesterday because its editors felt they were so important. About two million Americans have emphysema, said Dr. Norman H. Edelman, a consultant for scientific affairs for the American Lung Association. The disease, almost always caused by smoking, destroys air sacs in the lungs, leaving patients struggling for breath. Medical treatments offer little relief. But many surgeons have reported that the operation, which involves removing as much as 30 percent of the lung, can greatly improve lung function. Surgeons say the procedure works by removing damaged tissue and giving the healthier parts of the lung more room to expand and breathe. The operation costs about $60,000.
''A medical technology can create some rather serious problems that may not have been seriously thought out up front,'' Dr. Lauer said. Dr. Stevenson noted that medical care had become so fragmented that doctors implanting the devices in patients still functioning well could have a very different impression from doctors who care for people in the end stages of heart disease. Medical experts say it is hard to know what to expect -- how many heart attack patients with the devices will have defibrillator storms or other complications and how many will survive only to develop congestive heart failure. Another complication is that the defibrillators may also accelerate the course of the underlying heart failure. ''As we are making these decisions, it is not rational just to look at the positive side,'' Dr. Stevenson said. ''We need to look at the whole equation.'' The problem, she said, is that with little data, risks are hard to quantify.
The good cholesterol hypothesis comes from studies like the Framingham Heart Study, which has followed thousands of people in Framingham, Mass., for decades to see who developed heart disease. The studies showed that if two people had the same levels of the bad cholesterol, L.D.L., but different levels of the good cholesterol, H.D.L., the one with more H.D.L. was less likely to have heart disease. Researchers examining the biochemistry of the two molecules learned that they have opposite roles. Both transport cholesterol, the fatty substance used to make cell membranes and some hormones, but they carry it in opposite directions. L.D.L. ferries cholesterol to coronary arteries, where it imbeds and participates in the growth of plaque. H.D.L. takes cholesterol away from arteries to the liver, where it is disposed of. So with epidemiological studies showing reduced heart disease risk and science showing why, it would seem the picture was clear: the more H.D.L. the better. One H.D.L. molecule might even cancel one of L.D.L.
The system was never questioned until about two years ago, when Zevalin, or Ibritumomab tiuxetan, made by Biogen Idec, was approved for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, at a cost of about $25,000 a dose, and Medicare started paying the bills. Medicare administrators were taken aback by the price. They also worried that it would be widely used in patients other than those with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and that taxpayers would be paying for it without anyone knowing how well it worked in these untested situations. More biologics began to be approved. ''Each one of these biologics hits the market with a price tag of $10,000 to $30,000 a dose,'' Dr. Tunis said. ''It is one thing to try through clinical experience and trial and error to learn the off-label uses of drugs that cost $100 to $200 a dose. It is another thing with biologics that are not only expensive but can have pretty significant side effects.''
Dr. Thomas Pool, the scientific director of the Fertility Center of San Antonio, said he would not want to help infected patients because of the ethical and legal questions that would arise if the woman or the baby became infected. If he is asked to help such a couple, he said, he will refer them elsewhere. Dr. Sauer said he worried too, despite the evidence that the procedure was safe. If a couple he was treating had unprotected intercourse and the woman and her fetus became infected, he said, he and Columbia University could be held liable. That is not just a hypothetical fear, he said, because two women in the program told him that they were having unprotected sex. But a lawsuit like that could shut the program down. Some of his patients, including Ms. Morrison, who works in international publicity for Miramax, said they would hate to see the program end. There are almost no options for people with H.I.V., she said, and it took a titanic struggle for her to become pregnant with Mr. Corser's baby.
THE trouble began when Bobbie Gallagher noticed that her 2-year-old daughter was behaving strangely, obsessively spinning and scrupulously setting her toys in rows. Alanna Gallagher turned out to have autism, a rare neurological disorder of unknown cause. So did Alanna's little brother. So did about 40 other children who lived in the Gallaghers' town of Brick, N.J., near the seashore. The parents in Brick were alarmed. On average, 1 child in 500 is autistic; in the town, the figure is about three times that. But what does it mean? Does Brick have toxic chemicals in the water, pollutants in the air? The problem, scientists say, may be impossible to resolve. It was yet another instance of a phenomenon that makes many statisticians shudder. It was a disease cluster -- the Boy Who Cried Wolf of epidemiology. Every time a disease cluster turns up, communities worry, scientists scramble for a cause and, as in the new movie based on Jonathan Harr's 1995 book, ''A Civil Action'' (Random House), about a leukemia cluster in Woburn, Mass., lawyers start suing. Yet over and over again, despite years -- sometimes decades -- of efforts to link the disease with a cause, scientists usually come up empty handed.
Three days later, she had her answer. That chimpanzee, which had been healthy until she died in childbirth at age 26, held clues that eventually enabled Dr. Hahn and an international group of 11 others to unravel the mystery of the origin of the epidemic.  It was a mystery that took years to solve and that had frustrated researchers and the public, stunned by the sudden emergence of such a terrible new disease. Some said AIDS was caused by a mutant virus, a sort of Andromeda strain. Others favored conspiracy theories suggesting that H.I.V. had been created by scientists and escaped from germ warfare labs. There was a Western medicine disaster theory, which held that the virus was injected into Africans in bad batches of polio vaccine. Then there was a more pedestrian idea -- that people got H.I.V. from primates in Africa. Scientists tended to favor the primate hypothesis because they knew that diseases can jump from animals to people. Dengue fever, Hanta virus, influenza and hepatitis B all originated in other species. But, researchers learned, it was not easy to trace the virus causing the human AIDS epidemic, H.I.V.-1, to an animal. And even when they started seeing provocative hints about the origins of AIDS, those hints soon turned contradictory.
Yet today, noted Dr. William Haskell, an exercise physiologist at Stanford, many children still are inactive, many teenagers, as documented by Dr. Kimm, are virtually immobile, and just 25 percent of Americans meet national guidelines for 30 minutes of brisk walking or its equivalent most days of the week. About half the population, Dr. Haskell said, is ''active on a sporadic basis.'' As for rest, he said, ''They are couch potatoes.'' ''At least we have a high level of awareness,'' Dr. Haskell said. Most people know what they should be doing, even if they do not comply. Part of the problem, he speculated, may be that public health experts have emphasized how easy it is: just a half hour a day, not even all at once, and it can be accomplished just by walking. ''That message has led a lot of people to say, 'I already get 30 minutes a day,' '' Dr. Haskell said. ''But when you put monitors on them, they don't.'' He added, ''unless they had a stressful period, their heart rates never get above 100 beats per minute,'' which is less than would be expected from walking briskly.
Dani Danzig, a 56-year-old technical writer and editor who lives in Newton, Mass., is, by anyone's definition, one of those women whose symptoms go on and on. She began taking the hormone combination when she was 49, to control the symptoms of menopause. ''I was taking it quite contentedly,'' she said. ''I took it as I took my vitamins every morning for about five years.'' Then she began to worry. Studies were suggesting that the pills might increase a woman's risk of heart attacks and strokes. Her doctor suggested she stop using them, and so she tapered off. After six months, she thought she had done it -- she was no longer taking the pills and she was no longer suffering from hot flashes and night sweats. Then they returned, as disabling as ever. ''I would have three or four hot flashes every day and they disrupted whatever I was doing,'' Ms. Danzig said. ''They stopped me dead, they made me leave the room to change my clothes. It was a real show-stopper.'' The night sweats disrupted her sleep, leaving her soaked several times a night. ''I felt as though my whole system was being whipped around,'' she said.
The issue has grown more pressing as more companies conduct international studies to get enough patients. In recent years, they have increasingly turned to countries in Eastern and Central Europe. CV Therapeutics, for example, tested its drug in two large studies involving 1,014 patients, including about 365 from North America and Western Europe and close to 600 from Russia and Eastern Europe. Dr. Eugene Braunwald of Harvard Medical School, who is chairman of a not-for-profit academic group that runs clinical trials in cardiology, said fewer and fewer American patients participated. ''We are enrolling on average half as many patients in the U.S. now as compared to five years ago,''Dr. Braunwald said. One reason, he said, is that doctors do not want to take the time to enroll patients and to comply with the detailed testing and reporting a study requires. Business in Eastern and Central Europe is expanding rapidly, with American companies that conduct clinical trials opening offices there and local entrepreneurs setting up their own businesses.
''Overweight and obesity may soon cause as much preventable disease and death as cigarette smoking,'' Dr. Satcher said, introducing a report, ''A Call to Action to Prevent and Decrease Overweight and Obesity.'' Dr. James Morone, a political science professor at Brown University, recalls that concerns about obesity were suddenly raised to the level of ''crisis and obsession.'' For years, the surgeon general's office had been the great force behind the anti-tobacco campaign, Dr. Morone observed. ''In 2001, the tobacco settlements were in place. We'd gotten all the cultural mileage out of blaming tobacco for our sins. The surgeon general's report gave us a new sin and it resonated, it had a sense of truth.'' Dr. Saguy, at U.C.L.A., takes a similar view. ''Things we didn't think were possible before the anti-tobacco movement became possible afterward,'' she said. Companies could be held liable for selling a legal, but unhealthy product. Social pressures could change the image of smoking from glamorous to pitiable or even despicable. Now, she said, the overweight are pitiable or despicable.
He said that the Air Force considered its current statistical analysis the strongest evidence yet, but that it was beginning two additional biochemical studies to see if the effect held up. He added that the service had asked the federal government to spend millions of dollars on more such studies. Dr. Michalek said that no matter how he adjusted for other factors, like age, body weight and family history of diabetes, the association between dioxin exposure and diabetes remained. But some scientists are skeptical. Among them is Dr. Michael Gough, a retired biologist who was chairman of a federal advisory panel for the Ranch Hand study from 1990 to 1995. After spending years on the dioxin question, Dr. Gough said, ''The conclusion I've come to is that there is no evidence whatsoever to support any connection between low-level dioxin exposure and any human disease.'' Some statisticians said the Air Force study was fraught with pitfalls. Among them is the fact that Vietnam veterans have linked a variety of health complaints to exposure to Agent Orange and the study aims to look at virtually all of them.
Otherwise, the results were mixed. The rate of diabetes among the surgical patients remained steady, at 10 percent, but tripled to 24 percent in the patients who did not have surgery and did not lose weight. Blood pressure, however, was a different story. It fell in the first year after surgery but then crept up again. Eight years later, the blood pressures of the surgical patients were the same as those who did not have surgery. For the minority of obese people who are surgical candidates, the operation can turn their lives around. But they risk serious consequences, like bowel obstructions and malnutrition leading to anemia and bone loss, as well as a 1 percent to 2 percent risk of death. What is not known is whether the surgery's health benefits outweigh its risks over the long term. Dr. Russell Harris, an internist at the University of North Carolina who evaluated weight loss studies for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of experts that advises the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, said that when it came to surgery, the group decided, ''we just don't know'' what to recommend.
But, he added, it is not yet known whether losing weight will help with other medical conditions: ''Will it prevent or decrease the risk of heart attack or stroke or will you be less likely to be hospitalized? We don't know that yet.'' It is true that blood pressure may go down slightly or that cholesterol levels may improve. But does that translate into fewer heart attacks and strokes, the so-called hard outcomes? After all, hormone therapy for menopause improved cholesterol levels but studies showed that women who took it ended up with more heart attacks and strokes. With weight loss, Dr. Foster said, ''we don't know what happens to hard outcomes.'' Then there is the thorny question of how to help people slim down. ''The evidence is clear that people are aware of this problem and want to do something about it,'' said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, an obesity researcher and co-director of the diabetes center at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons. He added that wanting to look good can be an even greater motivation than wanting to avoid chronic disease years down the line. Yet, the number of fat Americans has inexorably increased year after year. With weight loss, many people fight a losing battle. ''If it were easy to do and there were good ways, people would have done it,'' Dr. Leibel said.
''When you add in heat and humidity, with the heat index you can expect a sensation, a feeling of 90 to 95 degrees when you are outside,'' Dr. Wilber said. ''With prolonged exposure and moderate physical activity, you will be on the borderline between caution and extreme caution.'' The physical activity the athletes will be doing could hardly be described as moderate, however. Parts of the 26-mile course are particularly dirty. ''If any of you have driven through the steel mill district of Gary, Ind., that's what it reminded me of,'' Dr. Wilber told the meeting participants. Air pollution can bring on exercise-induced asthma, even in athletes who never knew they were susceptible, Dr. Wilber said. But the runners cannot simply show up at the race and whip out an inhaler. The drug they inhale, a beta-2 agonist, is considered a banned performance enhancer. If it shows up in a urine test, the athlete is disqualified unless he or she has medically documented asthma.
Patients of these doctors can submit the doctors' bills to their insurance companies, but it is the patient, not the doctor, who must accept whatever the insurer provides. Some of these doctors accept Medicare payments or payments from a few other select insurance plans. Others, like Dr. Rubin, do not. Some doctors are asking patients to give them yearly retainers of thousands of dollars. ''The market is reasserting itself,'' said Dr. Alan Garber, an economist and specialist in internal medicine at Stanford University. ''In characteristic fashion in America, markets have emerged where they didn't exist.'' Health policy experts say there is no proof that patients who see doctors like Dr. Rubin are buying better health -- although they are buying more of a doctor's time and attention. ''People are buying what to them is very valuable,'' said Victor R. Fuchs, an emeritus professor of health economics at Stanford. ''They are getting instant attention, instant service. You call the doctor's office and one person is on the phone and he knows you. Suppose you have a medical test. In some situations you have to wait a week for the results. Here, it can be two hours. What some experts don't realize is that a huge amount of the dissatisfaction with medical care has to do with the level of service.''
For example, Dr. Atkins said, urinanalysis can detect bacteria in the urine of 5 to 10 percent of women who have no symptoms of bladder infection. But when such patients were studied, it turned out there was no difference in the outcomes between women given antibiotics and those given placebos. Although the bacteria disappeared in most women's urine after they began taking antibiotics, they often came back after the drugs were stopped. In the end, just as many patients in each group ended up with symptomatic bladder infections. The only difference was that the group of women who took antibiotics early on had more side effects. Other tests are superfluous for other reasons. Feeling the ovaries in a pelvic exam is not a good way to find ovarian cancer, according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the American College of Physicians; by the time a tumor can be felt, the cancer is probably too advanced for treatment to help. Not finding anything is not necessarily reassuring because small tumors cannot be felt anyway, the group adds.
Others found that the worm daf-2 gene was closely related to genes that cells use to respond to several hormones, including insulin, raising questions of whether there might be a simple hormonal treatment to retard aging substantially. The next step, Dr. Kenyon said, is obvious: ''Check in mice'' to see if the mouse version of the daf-2 gene controls life span. Dr. Rose came at aging from a different direction. It was 1976 and he was 21 years old, trying to decide whether to do his graduate work at Harvard University or at the University of Sussex, when he got a letter from Dr. Brian Charlesworth of Sussex. It said, ''I want you to work on the evolution of aging because I've solved the problem of aging,'' Dr. Rose recalled. ''I wrote back saying I didn't believe him.'' Dr. Rose hesitated even to think about studying aging, realizing that it was ''famous as the rocks on which scientists dashed their careers.'' But Dr. Charlesworth convinced Dr. Rose of the merits. Dr. Rose went to Sussex to join the research.
Patients who had surgery often reported immediate relief. But by three to six months, patients in both groups reported marked improvement. After two years, about 70 percent of the patients in the two groups said they had a ''major improvement'' in their symptoms. No one who waited had serious consequences, and no one who had surgery had a disastrous result. Many surgeons had long feared that waiting would cause severe harm, but those fears were proved unfounded. ''I think this will have an impact,'' said Dr. Steven R. Garfin, chairman of the department of orthopedic surgery at the University of California, San Diego. ''It says you don't have to rush in for surgery. Time is usually your ally, not your enemy,'' Dr. Garfin added. As many as a million Americans suffer from sciatica, said Dr. James Weinstein, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Dartmouth who led the study. The condition is characterized by an often agonizing pain in the buttocks or leg or weakness in a leg.
The study's findings shocked many women and their doctors, who had assumed that Prempro, which was the most popular estrogen-containing drug used by menopausal women, was simply replacing the lost hormones of youth. Prempro's sales have since dropped by 50 percent, said Doug Petkus, a Wyeth spokesman. But many women want to continue taking estrogen because it is the most effective treatment for symptoms of menopause, like hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness. Others have wanted estrogen because they believe, in the absence of rigorous evidence to show it, that estrogen improves memory and smooths the skin. So, after the risks of Prempro became known, many switched to other estrogen products. But the drug agency's commissioner, Dr. Mark McClellan, said yesterday that ''there is no reason to believe that any other drug is safer than Prempro.'' He added: ''We want similar labeling on all these products. At the moment we don't have the information to say that one or the other is different.''
Pathologists, looking at a tumor under a microscope, assign a rating, called a Gleason score, named after the pathologist who developed it. The score ranges from 2 to 10 and reflects the extent of deranged cells. Prostate cancers with Gleason scores from 8 to 10 are the most angry tumors, the ones that might kill a man in three to five years. Cancers with scores of five or six are more benign and, Dr. Albertsen said, could be candidates for watchful waiting. Another gauge of a tumor's risk is its P.S.A. level, which can indicate how many cancer cells may be lurking in a man's body. A score over 20 suggests the tumor has spread beyond the prostate. Once that happens, surgery to remove the prostate is unlikely to be successful, and the only course is radiation, to control the tumor's growth, and medication, to slow it down as long as possible.
''We felt it was not possible for us to look a patient in the eye and say, 'We honestly don't know whether you are better off with this operation or without it,' '' said Dr. Cooper of Washington University. He encouraged his Medicare patients to sue. ''I went to court 28 times and won 28 cases,'' he said. While some, like Dr. Ramsey, say that the clinical trial's results were far from a ringing endorsement of the operation, many lung surgeons disagree, saying that for the 25 percent of patients in the subgroup, the operation was a huge success. Dr. Barry Make, who directs the emphysema program at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, was struck by the survival benefit in the subgroup. ''That result is stupendous,'' Dr. Make said, adding that many patients also felt better. Dr. Ramsey and others worry that if Medicare approves the operation for the restricted group of patients like those in the subgroup, technology creep may lead to many more having the surgery.
Other studies have focused on populations, trying to determine whether overweight or obese people who voluntarily lost weight were healthier. Some studies found that they were; some found no difference; and some found that they actually died at a greater rate. The reason for the dearth of information on the long-term effects of weight loss, researchers say, is that very few people keep weight off. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease is now, for the first time, trying to get some concrete answers with an 11-year study of 5,000 overweight and obese diabetes patients. In justifying the new study, its designers state the quandary: ''Given the paucity of data on the impact of weight loss on morbidity and mortality, an increasing number of critics in both the lay press and professional literature have questioned whether obesity should be treated at all.'' Another question raised by obesity researchers is whether a fat person who loses weight is as healthy as a naturally thin person of the same weight.
Confounding a widely held impression, a large federal study has found that hormone therapy for menopause does not affect quality of life. Women taking the drugs did not feel more energetic, or have more sexual pleasure or even more restful sleep. They were not less depressed, their minds were no clearer and their memories did not appear to have improved. It is, medical experts say, a striking development in what has been a precipitous reversal of fortune for hormone therapy. Just when women and their doctors were coming to terms with the idea that the drugs can carry health risks, now the same study of 16,608 woman that found those problems says that while the drugs somewhat diminished hot flashes and night sweats in a subgroup of women, they were no better than placebos in improving other measures of quality of life. ''It is just stunning,'' said Cindy Pearson, executive director of the National Women's Health Network, an advocacy group that lobbied for the federal government to conduct the study, called the Women's Health Initiative.
The only thing proven to reduce the risk of a heart attack in someone with vulnerable plaque is the same thing that works to prevent vulnerable plaque from developing in the first place -- controlling cholesterol levels, blood pressure and blood sugar and not smoking. Excess cholesterol gets stuck in artery walls. The wall becomes inflamed with white blood cells of the immune system. Those white blood cells in turn spew out highly active molecules that change the biology of the artery wall, leading to plaque. With high blood pressure, the very molecules, angiotensin II, that raise blood pressure also bring the release of the damaging small molecules that inflame arteries and set off the growth of plaque. Smoking, Dr. Libby added, appears to cause heart attacks for a different reason: it makes blood more likely to clot. And it turns out that controlling these humdrum risk factors can nearly prevent heart attacks, said Dr. Daniel Levy, director of the Framingham Study, a federal study of heart disease in the population of Framingham, Mass.
''People are out scouring the landscape for things that make obese people look bad,'' said Kelly Brownell, director of the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale. And is that a bad thing? Dr. Jacobson doesn't think so. ''We felt that beyond public health, being overweight has many other socioeconomic implications,'' he said, which was why he was drawn to calculating the gasoline costs of added weight. The idea of using economic incentives to help people shed pounds comes up in the periodic calls for taxes on junk food. Martin B. Schmidt, an economist at the College of William and Mary, suggests a tax on food bought at drive-through windows. Describing his theory in a recent Op-Ed article in The New York Times, Dr. Schmidt said people would expend more calories if they had to get out of their cars to pick up their food. ''We tax cigarettes in part because of their health cost,'' he wrote. ''Similarly, the individual's decision to lead a sedentary lifestyle will end up costing taxpayers.''
But this time, with a handful of technical improvements that mostly involved methods for growing cells and breaking open embryos, they used an average of 17 eggs per stem cell line and could almost guarantee success with the eggs of just one woman obtained in a single month. It did not matter whether the patient whose cells were being cloned was young or middle-aged, male or female, sick or well -- the process worked. ''You almost have no reason not to do it,'' said Dr. Davor Solter, the director of the Max Planck Institute for Immunobiology in Freiburg, Germany. He added that it seemed more efficient to clone and obtain human stem cells than to do the same experiment in animals, although no one knows why. Seven states ban any type of human cloning and 11 have laws that prevent embryonic stem cell research, said Lori B. Andrews, a law professor at Chicago-Kent College of Law, and federal money is restricted to research using stem cell lines approved by the Bush administration in 2001. Where such work is legal, however, increasing numbers of scientists, including Dr. Zon, say they have private financing and plan to go forward using cloning to produce stem cells.
Yet while many drugs are sold over the Internet, the sale of memantine has a poignant twist -- because of their disease, the people taking it often cannot say whether they want to risk it or not. ''It's one thing to say 'I'll take my chances on this drug that hasn't been approved,' and it's another thing to say 'I'll give it to my mother,' '' Dr. DeKosky said. Family members of Alzheimer patients say they hear about memantine in support groups or from their doctors, their friends or the Alzheimer's Association's Web page. Many noticed the study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine on April 3, concluding that memantine might help slow the declining functions in patients with moderate to severe disease and reporting no significant side effects. And many discover that memantine has been used in Germany for years and that many doctors there consider it safe.
Janet Benshoof, president of the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, an advocacy organization that represents abortion providers, said, ''In general, if you're opening medical abortions to a wider range of doctors, they have no idea that this is a dungeon of criminal law, and once you do an abortion, the laws may apply even if it's just giving women a pill.'' There are numerous state laws that regulate doctors who provide abortions, and they often go into detail -- the size of the hallways in medical offices, the registration of abortion providers, the disposal of the fetal tissue. In some states, the laws speak of ''abortions'' without saying how they are performed. In others, the states specifically include pill-induced abortions along with surgical ones. Such laws, abortion providers and legal experts said, raise questions about the future of mifepristone. ''The only people who really know about the panoply of abortion laws are the clinics,'' Ms. Benshoof said.
After losing a series of court decisions that found it in violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech, the Food and Drug Administration has begun a wide-ranging review of regulations that control what the makers of drugs, supplements, food and cosmetics can say about their products. At issue is the delicate balance between a company's right to communicate with its customers and the food and drug agency's mandate to protect the public. But the court decisions, which included a stinging rebuke from the Supreme Court in April, have prompted the agency to ask whether it may, at times, have gone too far in its insistence that it decides when scientific truth has been established and what companies can say. At issue are regulations governing everything from what a drug company can print on a T-shirt to what a sales representative can say in the privacy of a doctor's office.
But, says Dr. Terrence Tumpey, a microbiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although the experimental vaccines protect against ordinary human flu viruses, they do not protect against the 1918 virus. Nor do they protect against today's A(H5N1) bird flu virus. That leaves scientists with a puzzle. If they are worried about a 1918-like flu, they want a universal vaccine to protect against it, and they wonder what makes these bird flus so impervious? At this point, no one knows, Dr. Tumpey says. Another abiding mystery is that neither the 1918 influenza pandemic nor any other human influenza pandemic began with a flu pandemic that killed birds. And, scientists add, if the 1918 pandemic had begun that way, it would have been noticed. Even if the deaths of wild birds went undetected, the deaths of domestic fowl would have been recorded. Wild birds are inured to most flu viruses -- clouds of the viruses normally infect them, living in their gastrointestinal tracts but causing little or no disease. Sometimes, those flu viruses infect poultry and, while they usually cause little illness, some flu strains can be lethal to fowl and economically devastating to farmers.
Many experts say that a rising furor over a new report that many starchy foods, including breads, cereals and French fries, are laced with a chemical that could cause cancer is overblown. The chemical is acrylamide, which, Swedish scientists reported last week, is produced when certain carbohydrates are baked or fried at high temperatures. The scientists have not published a paper on their small study. Instead, they made their announcement at a news conference last week. Shortly afterward, the World Health Organization announced it would ''organize an expert consultation as soon as possible to determine the full extent of the public health risk from acrylamide in food.'' But many experts said yesterday that it made no sense to be alarmed over unpublished data on a chemical that was very unlikely to have a measurable impact on cancer rates. ''It's just dumb, dumb, dumb,'' Dr. Stephen Safe, a professor of toxicology at Texas A&amp;M University. ''There are carcinogens in everything you eat. Maybe they'll just ban food.''
But, he said, the hormone hypothesis seemed to perfectly explain the data and he and his colleagues could find no other explanation. Donald Berry, head of the division of quantitative science at the cancer center and the senior investigator for the analysis, called the connection between the drop in rates and hormone use ''astounding.'' Over all, for women of all ages and all breast cancer types, the incidence of the cancer, the second leading killer of women, dropped by 7 percent in 2003, or about 14,000 cases, the researchers said. It was the first time that breast cancer rates had fallen significantly, something experts said was especially remarkable because the rates had slowly inched up, year by year, since 1945. But the decrease was most striking for women with so-called estrogen-positive tumors, which account for 70 percent of all breast cancers. In July 2002, the Women's Health Initiative, a large clinical trial looking at the use of one menopause drug, Prempro, made by Wyeth, found that women taking the drug had slightly higher breast cancer rates. The study's findings were a shock to many women and their doctors. Until then, many had assumed that Prempro simply replaced the lost hormones of youth. Within six months, the drug's sales had fallen by 50 percent.
Instead of giving risks in terms of percentages, they put the risks in terms of individual men and women. For example, data indicate that a 60-year-old woman who smokes has a 4.5 percent chance of dying of a heart attack in the next decade, a 6.5 percent chance of dying of lung cancer and a seven-tenths of 1 percent chance of dying of breast cancer. But the chart gives the same data another way: for every 1,000 60-year-old women who are smokers, 45 will die of heart attacks, 65 of lung cancer, and 7 of breast cancer in the next 10 years. Dr. Paul Slovic, a psychology professor at the University of Oregon and the president of Decision Research, a private nonprofit organization in Eugene, applauded the effort, noting that it was notoriously difficult to convey risks for a variety of reasons. One is that people want to understand what a particular risk estimate means to them. They tend to discount a risk described as a fraction of a percent and react very differently when the same risk is described in terms of individual people.
The white blood cells of the immune system are always bumping into cancer cells. They should attack cancers as foreign bodies and destroy them. Why don't they? Is it that the immune system is too weak? Or is it something else? As it turns out, Dr. Pardoll and others found, it was something else, and not at all what most scientists expected. The old idea, Dr. Pardoll said, was that cancers arise every day but the immune system destroys them. Anything that weakens the immune system -- stress, for example -- could hinder this surveillance. The result would be a cancer that grows large enough to resist the body's effort to heal itself. ''Nobody believes that anymore,'' Dr. Pardoll said. Dr. Fred Applebaum, director of the clinical research division at the Fred Hutchinson Center, said that he and most other cancer experts believed the theory. But then they looked at mice that were genetically engineered to have no functioning immune systems.
In California, said Dr. Ronald Bangasser, the past president of the California Medical Association, eight major health insurers have a new program in which they divide $30 million among 35,000 physicians depending on how their patients rate them. ''It could be $3,000, $4,000 or $5,000 per physician,'' Dr. Bangasser said. ''That would get their attention.'' Dr. Beth A. Lown, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and the immediate past president of the American Academy of Physicians and Patients, said: ''This goes to the heart of medicine -- the skillful enactment of communication and a truly heartfelt understanding of the patient's circumstances. And it seems to have gotten lost as doctors get involved in medical systems that prioritize speed and technology. Increasingly, people are relying on tests instead of talking to patients.'' Patients say the problems come in many guises. The arrogant or dismissive doctor. The impatient doctor with his hand on the doorknob. The patronizing doctor. Or, as one young woman experienced, the doctor who is callous and judgmental.
Dr. Richard Burgess, a member of Dr. Warach's stroke team, explained the situation: There is no particular penalty for not giving tPA. Doctors are unlikely to be sued if the patient dies or is left with brain damage that could have been avoided. But there is a penalty for giving tPA to someone who is not having a stroke. If that patient bleeds into the brain, the drug not only caused a tragic outcome but the doctor could also be sued. Few emergency room doctors want to take that chance. Treatment Barriers There is a way to diagnose strokes more accurately -- with a diffusion M.R.I., a type of scan that shows water moving in the brain. During a stroke, the flow of water slows to a crawl as dead and dying cells swell. In one recent study, diffusion M.R.I. scans found five times as many strokes as CT scans, with twice the accuracy.
In the second year of the study, the orlistat group was divided, with half the participants randomly assigned to continue taking the drug and to follow a weight maintenance diet and the others randomly assigned to take a placebo and follow the weight maintenance diet. Those who took the drug regained an average of 7 pounds while those who took a placebo regained 12.4 pounds. Half of the study participants dropped out before the two years were up. Dr. Steven B. Heymsfield of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, who was the lead author of the study, said its advantage was that the study was so large and so prolonged, asking not just whether people could lose weight over a period of weeks or months but over years. ''This study is the largest and longest of an obesity drug ever,'' he said. Orlistat, whose brand name is Xenical, blocks an enzyme that is needed to digest fat. The fat in the food a person eats will then accumulate in the intestines and be excreted, undigested. That mechanism causes the drug's main side effect, one that Dr. David F. Williamson of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described as ''embarrassing or inconvenient, to say the least.'' Most people who take orlistat complain of intestinal gas and bloating, and loose, smelly and oily stools.
One feature, for example, was suggested by a V.A. nurse. Why not put a bar code on a prescription bottle to identify the drug and its dose, put a bar code on the patient's wristband to identify the patient's prescription, and then scan the drug label and the patient's wristband before administering a drug? If there was a discrepancy, Vista could catch it before an error was made. Programmers added that feature, and V.A. drug errors plummeted by 80 percent overnight. Still, it is one thing to use a system that someone else installed and someone else maintains. It is another to get a set of disks in the mail and do it yourself. Giving out a version of Vista is ''a great idea,'' said Dr. David Kibbe, director of the center for health information technology at the American Academy of Family Physicians, a group that has been working on the project. ''But at the beginning, there was a lot of wishful thinking. They said, 'We'll just release it.' I said, 'Where's the fairy dust?'''
''If you put five extra dots on every mammogram, radiologists will call or will be tempted to call many more things abnormal,'' Dr. Smith-Bindman said. ''One way to put the whole package together is to say CAD really is not helping us much,'' she said. ''It's tricky, because places have invested in this technology.'' But, she said, if other studies confirm the results, ''I think you have to take it as a loss and move on.'' Dr. Hall, however, doubts that many centers will abandon their expensive investment, especially when it is so profitable. He expects that CAD will be refined and improved while breast cancer screening keeps changing with new technologies. ''The primary reasons we got CAD are that it was financially good for us and that everyone else was getting it,'' he said. ''It was a competitive thing.'' Even now, he said, ''there is no way CAD is dead.''
And, he added, ''some would argue that it is not even ethical,'' because one group of participants would have to agree to be sedentary when most medical experts think exercise is important for health. Dr. Blair is doing a randomized study of 450 middle-aged and older women who are slightly overweight. The women are assigned to one of three exercise groups, with one group exercising slightly less than the recommended amount, one exercising at the recommended amount, and the third exercising slightly more. He is asking how indirect measures of health, like blood pressure and oxygen consumption, vary as exercise is increased from mild to moderate to more than moderate. The goal, he said, is to try to get an exercise dose-response curve, at least for these indirect indicators of benefit. In the meantime, another group of medical experts, concerned with obesity, just issued its own exercise prescription, doubling the usual recommended amount.
In a paper published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Sue Y. S. Kimm of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and her colleagues reported that girls became so sluggish in their teenage years that many barely moved at all. Black girls were even more sedentary than whites, they added, warning that the stage is being set for a lifetime of obesity and associated chronic illnesses like high blood pressure and diabetes. Dr. Kimm followed 1,213 black girls and 1,166 white girls from age 8 or 9 until age 18 or 19, asking about their activity outside school. As the years went by, many girls moved about less and less, until, by the time they were 16 or 17, 56 percent of the black girls and 31 percent of the white girls reported no activity at all. ''We don't know what they were doing -- watching TV, talking on the phone. They could just be hanging out,'' Dr. Kimm said. But she added, she found their lack of activity alarming.
What if doctors had a new way to diagnose heart disease that took only seconds and provided pictures so clear it showed every clogged artery, so detailed that it was like holding a living heart in your hand? In fact, that new way exists and is coming into use in scattered areas of the country, and there is wide agreement that it will revolutionize cardiology. The scans can largely replace diagnostic angiograms, the expensive, onerous way of looking for blockages in arteries, and can make diagnosis so easy that doctors would not hesitate to use them. They are expected to cost about $700, compared with about $4,000 for an angiogram. Moreover, the scans take seconds to conduct and require no recuperation time; angiograms take nearly an hour and patients must stay in the hospital for a day. The new scans can see not just the outline of blood vessels but every detail inside and out.
Doctors bitterly debated how to treat patients. One group, explained Gretchen Worden, director of the M√ºtter Museum at the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, argued that if a treatment did not cure a patient or prolong life, it was worthless. Dr. Rush was of this school, she said. He advocated treating yellow fever with bleedings and violent purges, including large doses of mercury and jalap, the root of a plant that grows in Mexico and is related to the morning glory. He himself got  yellow fever during the epidemic but took his own treatment and recovered. In one of the newly discovered letters, dated Oct. 2, 1793, Dr. Rush told Dr. Samuel Powel Griffitts, a founder of the College of Physicians: ''I continue to use mercury in large doses, with great success. I have found 40 grains necessary in the course of the day to open the bowels. I rely upon no evacuations until they are large &amp; bilious.'' He added, ''I have only lost one patient who took mercury on the first day in the manner I have mentioned, &amp; I think I have saved two in a very advanced stage of the disorder by it.''
Mrs. Brandt, who is 63, says that after her initial diagnosis and a lumpectomy, she went to the University of Pennsylvania's hospital and she became a patient of Dr. John Glick. She had radiation treatments and chemotherapy at Penn and is now going through more chemotherapy there because her cancer has spread. ''I never considered going anywhere else,'' Mrs. Brandt said. ''Dr. Glick is at the top of his research game, and from the beginning he instilled great confidence in me and my family.'' Other patients, Dr. Glick said, are eager to return to their local doctors for chemotherapy and follow-up care, and he encourages it whenever he thinks it is appropriate. Penn has a network of community physicians, and other academic hospitals, like Memorial Sloan-Kettering, have suburban satellite centers. ''We try to get patients back into our network of community physicians if we think the same care can be given,'' Dr. Glick said. If there is a specialized surgical technique or treatment that is available only at Penn, though, he encourages patients to stay at Penn for that treatment.
The American study, by Dr. Bernard Fisher of the University of Pittsburgh and his colleagues, involved women with tumors up to four centimeters in diameter, or about an inch and a half, which can easily be felt. In more than a third, the cancer had spread to their underarm lymph nodes. The women were randomly assigned to one of three treatments: a mastectomy, a lumpectomy alone, or a lumpectomy followed by radiation. The study found that there was absolutely no difference in the likelihood that the disease would subsequently spread, in the rate of death from cancer, or in the rate of death from all causes. Regardless of the treatment, about 47 percent of the women were still alive 20 years later. In a sense, Dr. Borgen said, that has been a surprise. ''Everyone thought early on that radiation would improve survival,'' he said, ''but it didn't.'' Radiation did, however, markedly reduce the chance of another cancer's arising in the same breast, sparing many women a mastectomy, which is the usual treatment for a second cancer. The risk that a second cancer would emerge later in the same breast was about 40 percent in women who had a lumpectomy without radiation and about 14 percent in those who also had radiation therapy.
But, Dr. Kaback said, the more that geneticists learned, the less they understood. ''The frequency of the gene would predict that every major hospital would have large numbers of patients with complications of hemochromatosis,'' he said. ''They aren't there. We know the gene is there, but the great majority of the people don't get symptoms of the disease. There almost certainly is a group of modifying genes, as well possible environmental factors like diet or medications or other factors that influence the expression of the abnormal genes. ''But no one knows what they are or how many are involved or whether the same modifiers are at work in everyone who escapes illness''. In the meantime, he said, everyone has backed away from proposals to screen the population. It may be better for scientists to back away a bit from the promises of genetics, said Dr. Kenneth M. Weiss, a professor of anthropology and genetics at Pennsylvania State University. ''We are grossly overselling genetics,'' he said. ''I think we should really temper making genetics the established religion of our country.''
''They insist that if you would just eat less,'' Dr. Hirsch said. ''How many calories would it take? Come on, a mouthful less a day. Can't you do that,'' he said, adding,  ''Everyone wants to focus on the behavior side, as though people are perversely eating one bite more.'' But behavior has failed to explain why people stay fat, Dr. Hirsch and others say. Studies searching for behavioral characteristics, like binge eating, eating too quickly or skipping meals that typified obesity failed to find consistent patterns. Every behavior by fat people was found just as often in thin people. It is a lesson that has been met with denial or disbelief, even by some who run research programs on obesity. These experts say that until recently they would point to height-weight charts and tell fat people that their goal should be to get to what the chart said was an optimal weight for their height. Only a few got their weights down that low and even fewer could maintain them. Now, these researchers say, they are citing what is a more realistic weight goal -- a loss of about 10 percent of body weight, which often is enough to make people healthier, lowering their blood sugar and blood pressure.
Even before the publication -- reported last night by a South Korean newspaper, one day ahead of the embargo imposed by Science -- the research was criticized by cloning opponents. Dr. Leon R. Kass, chairman of the President's Council on Bioethics, called for federal legislation to stop human cloning for any purpose. ''The age of human cloning has apparently arrived: today, cloned blastocysts for research, tomorrow cloned blastocysts for babymaking,'' Dr. Kass wrote in an e-mail message. ''In my opinion, and that of the majority of the Council, the only way to prevent this from happening here is for Congress to enact a comprehensive ban or moratorium on all human cloning.'' The House has twice passed legislation that would ban all human cloning experiments, most recently in February 2003. But the bills have foundered in the Senate, where many members who oppose reproductive cloning do not want to ban it for medical research.
''Nobody knows about the long-term safety of bisphosphonates,'' Dr. Gallagher said. ''It gets into the bones and stays there a long time, and nobody knows the long-term implications.'' But, he said, he cannot recommend that Ms. Kipfer simply do nothing for her bones. ''If she discontinues estrogen,'' he said, ''she will lose everything she gained within two to three years.'' Ms. Kipfer says she knows what a fractured bone in her back feels like, because she once broke a spinal bone in an accident and the pain was excruciating. Her husband told her he thought the choice was clear: the osteoporosis benefit was not worth the risk of cancer and heart attacks. ''Don't you think you'd rather have a little pain than die?'' Ms. Kipfer said he asked her. Recalling what that spinal pain felt like, she said she was not so sure. ''You don't want to make a mistake you can't correct,'' she said.
The hallmark of the illness is a damaged heart, from a heart attack, viral infection, high blood pressure or unknown causes. Struggling to pump blood, the heart grows, sometimes getting so large that it fills a patient's chest. Soon the lungs fill with fluid, and, with congested lungs and a heart that can barely pump, patients become so short of breath that they cannot walk across a room. Half die within five years. Those who respond to beta blockers, Dr. Liggett proposed, may have a slight variation in a gene that determines the structure of a protein on heart cells where the drugs attach. In the meantime, Dr. Michael Bristow of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center found himself unable to give up on bucindolol. Poring through the clinical trial data, he was convinced that some patients were substantially helped, even more than they were by other beta blockers.
His own nine-member group, Dr. Rex says, has similar data showing a fourfold difference in detection rates. A paper on that data will be published in January in The American Journal of Gastroenterology. The issue is of great concern to doctors and patients alike, said Dr. Robert E. Schoen, a gastroenterologist at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute. ''We all agree that if you are doing a colonoscopy, you should do it well,'' Dr. Schoen said. ''It's a huge commitment on the part of the patient, and it's a huge dollar commitment,'' costing as much as $2,000. More than four million Americans a year have colonoscopies, hoping to protect themselves from colon cancer. The cancer, which kills about 55,000 Americans a year, is the second-leading cause of cancer death in the United States. In a colonoscopy, a doctor pushes a flexible scope, called an endoscope, to the top of a patient's colon, near the appendix, and slowly withdraws it, looking for adenomas. Though more than 90 percent of adenomas will never develop into cancer, the best precaution is to remove them. The exam is so effective, guidelines say, that if no polyps are found, the person can wait a decade before being examined again.
''It was going on for months,'' Dr. Kirkland said. But in the end, the conclusion was clear: There was no pertussis epidemic. ''We were all somewhat surprised,'' Dr. Kirkland said, ''and we were left in a very frustrating situation about what to do when the next outbreak comes.'' Dr. Cathy A. Petti, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Utah, said the story had one clear lesson. ''The big message is that every lab is vulnerable to having false positives,'' Dr. Petti said. ''No single test result is absolute and that is even more important with a test result based on P.C.R.'' As for Dr. Herndon, though, she now knows she is off the hook. ''I thought I might have caused the epidemic,'' she said.

The coding starts with a continuously generated string of random numbers, say from a satellite put up to broadcast them or from some other source. The numbers can be coming by at an enormous speed -- 10 million million per second, for example. The sender of a message and its recipient agree to start plucking a sequence of numbers from that string. They may agree, for example, to send a message, encoded with any of today's publicly available encryption systems saying ''start'' and giving instructions on capturing certain of the random numbers. As they capture the numbers, the sender uses them to encode a message, and the recipient uses the numbers to decode it. An eavesdropper can know the mathematical formula used to encode and decode, but without knowing the exact sequence of random numbers that were used in the formula to send a particular message, the eavesdropper cannot decode the message. And the only way to have that sequence is to just happen to be storing numbers from the unending stream at exactly the right moment.
The largest and longest study ever of an obesity medication found that a new drug, orlistat, can help obese people lose modest amounts of weight, a study being published today says. While orlistat is not yet approved for marketing, its maker, Hoffmann-La Roche of Nutley, N.J., said the Food and Drug Administration had sent the company a letter saying the drug could be approved if it sent the agency additional safety information. Yesterday, the company submitted that data, said Dr. Jonathan Hauptman, the director of metabolic research at Hoffmann-La Roche. The study, financed by Hoffmann-LaRoche and published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, involved 892 healthy, but obese, adults, mostly women, who were studied at 18 medical centers across the country. Their average weight at the start of the study was about 220 pounds. After one year, those who were randomly assigned to take orlistat and follow a weight loss diet lost an average of 19.3 pounds while those assigned to take a dummy pill and follow the weight loss diet lost about 12.8 pounds. That meant, Dr. Hauptman said, that the weight loss with orlistat was 50 percent greater than with placebo. Others pointed out that the difference was about 6 1/2 pounds.
But these tests are uncomfortable as well as being more expensive and elaborate than the fecal test. The fecal test is also the only one that has been shown in rigorous studies to reduce the colon cancer death rate, though doctors are convinced that the other tests have the same effect. In fecal occult blood screening, patients take home a test kit and collect two tiny samples from three consecutive bowel movements, then mail the kit for testing to see if there is blood in the stool. A patient who tests positive should be scheduled for a colonoscopy to see if the blood actually came from a polyp or cancer. Few Americans have any colon cancer screening. The American Cancer Society estimates that only about a third of Americans older than 50 have ever been tested, and Dr. Mandel said that it had been estimated that at most a quarter of Americans older than 50 ever had a fecal blood test. One reason, he said, was that doctors had tended not to recommend the test.
''I was talking about arthritis one time, and a little voice in the back of the room said: 'You mean I'm going to have to live with this? How am I going to live with this?' Another woman held up a rheumatoid claw and said, 'Honey, at the break I'll tell you how.' '' Regular Phone Chats At Dartmouth Medical School, Dr. Wasson had another idea to improve medical office practice. But his experience showed the obstacles to change, even when an idea's worth can be demonstrated. Dr. Wasson reasoned that one problem for patients was just the sheer trouble of making a doctor's appointment and then, when they arrive, waiting around to get into the examining room and blurting out their questions -- all for something that might not really require that the doctor see them. He developed a study to see whether telephone calls from a doctor might substitute for some office visits.
Using Mice and Fish, for Now A short distance away, Dr. Leonard Zon, the chief of stem cell research at Children's Hospital, and his colleague Dr. George Q. Daley are working with stem cells from embryos, using mice and zebra fish for now. They want to learn how to transform the stem cells into immature blood cells that will divide and replenish themselves. Then, if they can apply their work to human embryonic stem cells, they want to use the cells instead of bone marrow transplants to treat patients with genetic disorders like sickle cell anemia, and inborn disorders of the immune system. Dr. Zon treats children with these diseases, most of whom do not have a relative whose cells match theirs closely enough to serve as a bone marrow donor. He urgently wants to help. But he is not there yet. So far, in research that stem cell investigators say is among the most promising in the field, Dr. Zon and Dr. Daley have turned mouse embryonic stem cells into mouse blood cells. Those blood cells, however, are more mature than the ones they need, a particular type of early blood cells that can repopulate a patient's bone marrow and survive indefinitely. Ones that are more mature live out their lifespans and die within weeks.
The patients at the Anchorage Native Primary Care Center, a medical clinic in Alaska, did not like to wait. And yet waiting, it seemed, was almost all they did. It took a month or longer to see a doctor. And when patients arrived at the clinic, they usually waited an hour or more to get into an examining room. While their health care at the clinic cost them nothing -- they are Native Americans, using a facility that was partly financed by the federal government -- the delays were so onerous that those who could afford to get their health care elsewhere did so. That was last year. Now the clinic  is unrecognizable. Those who call by 4 p.m. are guaranteed appointments  that day to see their own doctor, even if it is for a routine checkup. And once they arrive, they see their doctor within 15 minutes. ''Most of them still don't believe it,'' said Dr. Christopher Sargent, a family-practice doctor at the clinic.
She delves into contemporary literary fiction and loves classic writers, like George Eliot and Charles Dickens. ''Intuition'' began with a literary notion -- the idea of a couple whose relationship becomes poisoned by suspicion. She envisioned one member of the couple becoming convinced that the other is cheating, but not being completely sure. ''I am not interested in adultery,'' Ms. Goodman said. ''That's been done.'' Instead, she said, ''I thought of moral ambiguity.'' She thought of science, and the gray areas, the times when experiments stopped working or results were questioned and it was so hard to figure out what had happened. Was it human error? Was it sloppiness? Was it a natural human tendency to believe in a hypothesis so strongly that somehow data that do not seem to fit are edited out? Or was it fraud? Ms. Goodman started reading accounts of scientific fraud and saw, she said, ''how dry they were,'' although, she added, ''their essence was compelling.
''The current medical model is not working,'' Dr. Gross said. She decided that the solution was to offer testing to the world's Jews rather than wait for people to ask for it. ''I can't see any other way to get this fixed,'' Dr. Gross said. The group worked with the Trust for Jewish Philanthropy, which convened experts on genetic disease research and testing and asked them for advice. ''The opinion I had was, 'Why not?' '' said Dr. Charles R. Scriver, a geneticist at McGill University in Montreal. In previous decades, Dr. Scriver directed screening in Montreal to identify carriers of Tay-Sachs and beta-thalassemia, a genetic disease that causes severe anemia. High school students were told about the diseases and offered an opportunity to be tested and given information about the results. Although those who chose to be tested learned about their genes, no one else could see their results.
He also answers questions, including, ''What is the funniest thing that ever happened to you?'' Donor 1913 relates an incident that occurred when he asked his girlfriend's mother to step on his stomach to demonstrate his strong abdominal muscles. ''As she stepped on top of my stomach, I passed gas,'' he writes. Is Don Juan the gas-passer also the most popular donor at Fairfax Cryobank? Mr. Jaeger, the director, says he'll never tell. He cautions that discussing the most popular donor, whoever it is, might pose a problem -- there is already a waiting list for his sperm, and publicity can only make it worse. ''We just can't keep enough of his units on hand,'' Mr. Jaeger says. Anonymous Conception
''Uncertainty is very painful,'' Dr. Gordis said. ''The idea that science is not giving you certitude is very difficult for many people to accept.'' The mammography argument, scientists say, is only taking place because the test's benefit was never that great in statistical terms. While the test can find tumors too small to feel, does finding and treating them that early save lives? Some of the strongest evidence is from a study begun in the 1960's. It found that after 18 years, 153 out of 30,131 women who had mammograms had died of breast cancer, and 196 out of 30,565 women who did not have the test died of breast cancer. That is a 30 percent difference in breast cancer death rates -- but it hinges on the medical histories of just 43 women. Questions about the design and conduct of this study have led some to doubt its conclusion. And similar questions have been raised about other mammography studies.
''It's like holding the end of an 18-inch pencil and trying to write your name,'' Dr. Damiano said. It was even difficult to see inside the patient's chest. ''You worked with a camera and you had someone else hold the camera,'' Dr. Damiano said. ''An analogy was if you went to a baseball game and someone else was holding your head the whole time. Any time you wanted to make a move, you had to tell them to move your head.'' The surgeons, trying to sew together blood vessels about the size of a strand of spaghetti with thread thinner than a human hair, finally gave up. ''It is beyond the limits of human dexterity,'' Dr. Damiano said. Robotic surgery was born out of this experience. The companies worked on methods for doctors to do heart surgery through small holes in the patient's chest, but with a computer controlling the movements of the long sticks.
To get those details right, Mr. Vandermark asks questions that seem almost whimsical, for example, ''Do you pedal when you go around a sharp curve?'' ''If you pedal through corners,'' he explained, ''it affects the height of the cranks from the ground. The lower we make that, the more stable the bike will be. The higher we make it, the easier it is to pedal through corners without clipping a pedal.'' In addition, Mr. Vandermark said, a rider who pedals through sharp curves tends to be someone who is more confident and will want a stiffer frame. The advantage is better acceleration -- ''when you stand on the pedals, it responds.'' The disadvantage is that the rider feels every bump in the road. Building a frame, custom builders say, is a matter of constant compromise. Even making a bicycle lightweight involves sacrificing other features, like stability and handling. Mr. Schwinn, a heavy man, saw those problems firsthand when he test rode a featherweight bicycle with a titanium frame. Something seemed wrong the moment he started to ride.
Dr. Lindsay A. Farrer, chief of the genetics program at Boston University's School of Medicine, who wrote an editorial accompanying Dr. Hendrie's paper, agreed that vascular disease might be an important component of Alzheimer's disease. He noted in particular a study of nuns who had had symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and whose brains, at autopsy, showed the typical Alzheimer's lesions. He said the study found, ''to the amazement of many,'' that the nuns whose brains also had evidence of small strokes had more severe Alzheimer's symptoms. Moreover, Dr. Farrer said, some studies indicate that people with high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels are at increased risk of getting Alzheimer's disease. For now, the question of whether vascular disease contributes to Alzheimer's disease is still a hypothesis, researchers say. Dr. Neil Buckholtz, who is chief of the dementias of aging branch at the National Institute on Aging, said it was too soon to rule other hypotheses out.
Mr. Trent said he did not believe that the PCB levels in farmed salmon posed a risk. But he said the industry was working on ways to reduce them, substituting soybean oil for part of the fish oil in feed. ''The fact is that PCB's don't belong in any food,'' Mr. Trent said, ''and we are working very hard to get it out of our food.'' But, he quickly added, the contaminants are in meats and dairy products, too. ''If you put the same standards on milk,'' Mr. Trent said, ''people would be allowed to drink five glasses of milk a week.'' This study confirmed the findings of a smaller study on the safety of farmed salmon that was released last summer by an advocacy group, the Environmental Working Group. After buying 10 farmed salmon at supermarkets and having them analyzed for PCB's, the group concluded, in a small, unpublished study, that the levels were so high that people should eat farmed salmon no more than once a month.
In both cases, the investigators found, patients at community hospitals fared at least as well as those at academic medical centers. With pneumonia, for example, patients are supposed to receive antibiotics within four hours of being admitted to the hospital. ''If you go to a community hospital, you had a 72 percent chance of getting your antibiotics within four hours of hitting the door,'' Dr. Lindenauer said. ''If you go to the large teaching hospital, you have a 56 percent chance.'' ''Our study wasn't able to answer why,'' Dr. Lindenauer added, but he said he has a hunch. ''A routine case of pneumonia may not command all of the resources and personnel of the emergency room in the way it might in a community hospital.'' The study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease came to the same conclusion: The hospitals that took care of more of these patients really did no better than the hospitals that took care of fewer, he said.
''That's what the vast majority of the 3,700 members of the North American Spine Society do,'' Dr. Errico said. ''The vast majority discourage surgery or don't offer surgery as the first recourse.'' Whether patients benefit from treatment or whether their pain eases on its own, back experts agree that 10 percent of cases are intractable. Dr. Rowland Hazard, a professor of orthopedics and medicine at Dartmouth, estimates that 80 percent to 90 percent of spending on back pain ''is devoted to this 10 percent who don't get well.'' Their prognosis is disheartening. Those with disabling pain for three or four months have just a 10 percent to 20 percent chance of getting better in the next year. For this group, some doctors are now advocating a different approach altogether: teaching people to live with pain, to put aside the understandable fear that any motion will aggravate their injury. They have to learn, Dr. Weinstein said, that ''hurt doesn't mean harm.''
IT seems a fairly obvious idea: when science experiments are successful, the results are published in a well-respected journal for all to see and the body of human knowledge expands. But the sad truth about science is that most experiments fail and the hypotheses that seduced researchers turn out not to be true or, at least, the studies provide no evidence that they are true. Are such studies any less important, any less successful? And what happens to them? Generally, if the negative studies are large and the hypotheses well known, they will be published. That happened, for example, with studies of thousands of cellphone users finding no evidence that cellphone radiation predisposes to brain cancer. It also happened with a study published last month finding no evidence that men who had vasectomies are more likely to get prostate cancer. But if the studies are small -- just some professor's good idea proved wrong --the findings often are never published, leading future researchers to waste time and money going down the same blind alley. Or, if a study that fails to support a popularly held idea -- that stress causes ulcers, for instance -- goes unpublished, people may continue to believe in an association that has never actually been proven.
Many companies appear to have rushed into the opening. ''The Women's Health Initiative Study wasn't out of my fingers before the mailings started coming in,'' said Dr. Nanette Santoro, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. ''It's what you expect in a capitalist economy. You have people with products to sell.'' Prempro, like other estrogen replacements, is clearly effective against some symptoms of menopause, including hot flashes and vaginal dryness. Dr. Isaac Schiff, chief of obstetrics and gynecology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said the government's findings touched off ''a mild to severe panic'' and left some women desperate for alternatives. ''Now we are seeing the fallout,'' Dr. Schiff said. ''They are saying, 'The hot flashes are killing me,' or 'I don't feel well.' '' Some of his patients tell him they have lost energy or a sense of well-being.
Dr. Sauer said his clinic had treated 54 infected men. He has made more than 103 attempts at producing pregnancies. So far, 29 women have become pregnant and have had their babies or are more than halfway through pregnancy. Thirty babies have been born, with nearly half the women having twins, as is typical in fertility treatment. Dr. Sauer noted that published reports from Europe indicated that about 1,500 attempts at creating pregnancies with sperm from people with H.I.V., using a different method, had resulted in 250 successful pregnancies and no viral transmission. Dr. Sauer acknowledges that he has treated too few patients to judge the odds of infection. But he knows that many men with H.I.V. want help in having children. More than 900,000 Americans are believed to have the virus, and many, including gay men, indicate in surveys that they want children. Dr. Sauer said he was appalled when some couples told him they had considered having unprotected sex to have a baby. ''That's like playing Russian roulette,'' he said.
Some gynecologists say they will continue, for the time being, to recommend that some women take estrogen to protect against heart disease. Dr. Wulf H. Utian, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Cleveland who is the executive director of the North American Menopause Society, said he had and still would use estrogen for that purpose. The new findings, he said, ''don't change my stance at all.'' Dr. Charles B. Hammond, a professor and chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University, said ''it's way too soon to react'' to the Women's Health Initiative study. Hormone replacement therapy ''is one tool in the war on cardiovascular disease and a very important one,'' he said, cautioning that at this point ''we have to be very careful not to stampede women based on scanty information.'' But some women say their doctors tried to stampede them the other way -- into taking the hormones.
''There are big political battles between the medical societies over who controls imaging,'' Dr. Wang said. ''Gastroenterologists should be involved in making the decisions on which tests should be done. They should be aware of the technology and how to use it in order to ensure that patients get the best possible care.'' As the battle over colon cancer screening gets going, Dr. Wang said, ''I would certainly use cardiology as an example.'' Not everyone would agree that the colonoscopy era is coming to an end. Those CT scans, sometimes called virtual colonoscopies, are not necessarily going to replace most traditional colonoscopies, some skeptics say, and if a CT scan or one of the more futuristic tests does find a polyp, the patient will still need a colonoscopy to take it out. ''Dire warnings never happen,'' said Dr. James T. Frakes, a gastroenterologist in Rockford, Ill., and past president of the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. ''I think it always makes sense to look forward, but physicians, just by nature, are worriers. They can get so wrapped up in the worry that it paralyzes them.''
Ms. Todd chose IVIG anyway -- she said she had a test beforehand to rule out allergic reactions -- and traveled to Dr. Sher's Chicago clinic for treatment. She spent $38,000 there for a single cycle of in vitro fertilization, including medications to elicit ovulation, laboratory tests and IVIG. And she did become pregnant. But the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage. She returned to Dr. Sher, became pregnant again and had another miscarriage that she attributed to scarlet fever. A few months later, she flew to Dr. Sher's Las Vegas office to try again, spending $5,000 for airfare and a hotel, but she did not ovulate. Back at Cornell, she let Dr. Rosenwaks try again, but in the meantime received IVIG from another New York doctor, since Dr. Rosenwaks refused to provide it. ''In general, I treat my patients the way I would treat my family,'' Dr. Rosenwaks said in a telephone interview. ''If someone had infertility and needed I.V.F. and they were a family member of mine, they would not get IVIG.''
''They had an incredible amount of eggs and an opportunity to perfect the protocols,'' said Dr. Jose B. Cibelli, formerly with Advanced Cell Technology and now a professor of animal biotechnology at Michigan State University. ''They tried 14 different protocols.'' Dr. Cibelli consulted with the Koreans toward the end of their work and is listed with them as an author of the paper in Science. The researchers experimented with different timing, between adding the cumulus cell to an egg and activating the egg, making it start to divide with its cumulus cell genes. ''If they waited four hours instead of two hours, it didn't work,'' Dr. Hans Sch√∂ler, a professor of reproductive medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, said. All along the way, Dr. Sch√∂ler added, such small variations in the procedure had marked effects. ''Marginal differences made it work,'' he said. ''If you stepped a little bit to the right or a little bit to the left, it didn't work.''
The common view, he said, was that ''extra care, extra monitoring, extra attention leads to better outcomes,'' regardless of whether the patients receive the standard therapy or the experimental one. Searching the medical literature, the investigators found two dozen published studies that compared outcomes among cancer patients who enrolled in a clinical trial to those who did not. The data were not ideal, Dr. Joffe said, because cancer patients who took part in the trials were often hard to compare with those who did not; patients in the trial group might be younger and healthier, for example. But over all there was no evidence that they had better outcomes. The only exceptions came in a few studies of children and of adults with blood cancers. ''Those are settings where a lot of cancers are more treatment-responsive, so treatment makes more of a difference,'' Dr. Joffe said. Also, the pediatric studies tended to be from years when researchers were making enormous strides in treatment and when those patients getting the experimental treatments tended to do much better.
In the local race, Mr. Doughty rode the first 60 laps, putting the team far ahead. But other team members chafed to ride. So Mr. Doughty stopped, letting others take over. Soon the team was ahead by only one lap, so Mr. Doughty got back on his bike and finished the race, winning it for the team. These days, Dr. Costill and Dr. Scott W. Trappe, the current director of the Human Performance Laboratory, are looking at aging. With training, they found, older and younger people gain the same amount of strength in their quadriceps muscle in the front of the thigh. But, the researchers also discovered, older people gain mostly slow twitch muscles, while the younger subjects gain mostly fast twitch ones. ''What happens when people get old?'' Dr. Costill asked. ''They get slow.'' They move slowly and their reaction times are slowed, contributing to falls when they trip, for example, probably because their muscles are so weak.
They discovered, first, that fat infants -- those younger than 3 -- were no likelier to be fat adults than those of normal weight. But after age 3, fatness was more likely to persist. And, Dr. Whitaker said, ''the older the overweight kids were, the more likely they were to look that way as adults.'' For example, children who were obese at 6 to 9 had a 55 percent chance of being obese as adults. Their risk was 10 times that of children of normal weight. Those who were obese at 10 to 14 had a 67 percent chance of being obese as adults -- 28 times the risk of their peers who were not obese. When the researchers took into account the fatness of the parents, the data became even more startling. An obese child 6 to 9 had a 37 percent chance of being an obese adult if neither parent was obese. But if at least one parent was fat, the child's change of growing up to be fat nearly doubled, to 71 percent.
Two years ago, doctors at the Mayo Clinic reported that 24 women who had taken the combination of diet drugs called fen-phen had highly unusual and grave heart valve damage. In response, the manufacturers withdrew two of the drugs from the market, and thousands of patients sued, asserting that the drugs had damaged their hearts. Today, scientists in Boston are publishing a study of 226 patients at a weight-loss clinic that fails to show a correlation between fen-phen and severe heart damage. Other scientists, however, said that the study was small and that the results were not conclusive. The study, by Dr. Andrew J. Burger and colleagues at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, involved obese patients who had taken the drugs as part of an investigation of their effects on weight loss. From 1994 to 1997, the drugs, phentermine combined with either fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine, were taken by an estimated six million Americans for weight loss.
But seldom have the stakes been so high and the choices so stark as with the new lung cancer test. The cost of testing all current and former smokers with the lung scanner would be immense -- more than $39 billion, according to the National Cancer Institute. Yet if the test works, it could save hundreds of thousands of lives and alleviate terrible suffering. ''It has become a huge debate,'' said Dr. Jonathan Goldin, a radiologist at the University of California in Los Angeles. ''There's an academic interest, there's a health policy interest, there's a highly emotional desire to do good for patients. And then there's an economic interest -- you can make a fair amount of money right now if you opened up a spiral scanner and said, 'Let's go for it.' '' Is Early Detection Good? The idea of using the spiral CT scanners to find early lung cancers began with an iconoclast, Dr. Claudia L. Henschke, the division chief of chest imaging at Weill Cornell Medical Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She knew that most scientists dismissed lung cancer screening as useless. Doctors could find the cancer early with chest X-rays. But studies indicated that the lives of these patients had  not been prolonged.
Within minutes, Dr. James M. Kirshenbaum, director of acute interventional cardiology, assisted by Dr. Pande, threaded a thin tube, like a long and narrow straw, from an artery in Mr. Orr's groin to his heart. They injected a dye to make Mr. Orr's arteries visible to an X-ray and they saw the problem -- a huge clot in his heart's left anterior descending artery, blocking blood flow to most of his heart. The quickest option was to open that artery with a balloon and keep it open with a stent, a tiny mesh cage, if possible. It worked -- the balloon shattered the clot and pushed the debris against the artery wall and the stent held the artery open. Then a different problem arose. When the large clot was pushed aside, the debris was shoved against the opening of a small artery that branched from the larger one, much as a snowplow clearing a street can block a driveway.
''The bottom line, if there is a bottom line, is that risk in an individual case is not an easily defined concept,'' said Dr. Steven N. Goodman, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. One way to think about risk, Dr. Goodman said, is that ''each of us has a little ticking time bomb, a riskometer inside of us.'' It says that everyone is at risk and that eating and health habits can raise or lower risk. ''The other way comes closer to the way many people experience risk,'' Dr. Goodman said. ''It says that the risk is not in them but that each individual has a fate. I am either going to live or die at the end of the day. I am going to survive this cancer or not. Probabilities are uncertainties that the doctor has about what is going to happen to us.'' And that, Dr. Goodman said, ''is a profoundly different way of thinking about risk.''
The advisory panels will also review research and hear experts on whether Plan B meets the over-the-counter criteria. They include can patients decide for themselves whether to take it? Can they use it properly? Are its side effects relatively minor and self-limited? Proponents argue that studies show conclusively Plan B's safety. ''Because taking emergency contraception is time sensitive, it is important for women to be able to have access to it 24 hours a day seven days a week,'' Gloria Feldt, president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said. ''If every woman of reproductive age had access to it when she needs it, we could prevent half the unintended pregnancies and half the abortions.'' Women's Capital is selling Plan B to Barr Laboratories of Woodcliff Lake, N.J. The president of Barr, Dr. Carole Ben-Maimon, said it favored over-the-counter status. The Women's Capital chairwoman, Dr. Ellen Chesler, said, ''There is one issue in a switch, and that is safety.'' Plan B, Dr. Chesler added, is safe. ''From a moral standpoint,'' she said, ''I don't think it should bother anybody.''
The E.P.A.'s conclusions on dioxin are being met with vigorous responses from industry and from environmentalists. ''The E.P.A. has a real dilemma,'' said Dr. Marcie Francis, senior director of science policy at the Chlorine Chemistry Council, an industry group. ''If the food supply is safe and yet at the same time dioxin is causing cancer, it's a real contradiction.'' Rick Hind, legislative director of the Toxics Campaign by the environmental group Greenpeace, said the agency did not go far enough. A pesticide would be banned if its cancer risk was 1 in 1,000,000, Mr. Hind said, and so why did the agency tolerate dioxin, with a cancer risk of 1 in 100? ''They prefer,'' he said, ''to look largely at the endpoints -- what some call 'blame the victim.' Don't burn trash in your backyard. Eat a low-fat diet. That's not enough.'' The Toxics Campaign wants a ban on chlorine compounds used in manufacturing, like polyvinyl chloride in plastics.
Even so, manufacturers say thousands of the old gauges are being returned and demand for new mercury ones is drying up. ''Our business has suffered substantially,'' said John Baum, president of the Baum Company of Copiague, N.Y. There are several alternatives to the mercury gauges, all producing the familiar numerical readings of pressure when the heart beats and when it rests between beats. Aneroid devices -- the term means ''without liquid'' -- use metal that acts like a spring to measure blood pressure. Automatic devices measure pressure in a variety of ways, including converting pressure readings into measurable electronic waves. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates medical devices, has no official standards that companies must follow for approval of ones that measure blood pressure. But it says that in practice, companies use tests that include making sure that a prototype of a device accurately measures blood pressure in repeated laboratory tests.
One woman in Canada died of an infection during the drug's clinical trials and an American woman who had an undetected tubal pregnancy died after she took the drug. There were 264 adverse reactions, including infections, bleeding, allergic reactions and tubal pregnancies. But it is unclear what happened to Holly Patterson. Did she have enough medical supervision while taking the pills? When did she seek medical attention? Did she wait until it was too late? Did she tell the doctors in the emergency room that she had taken mifepristone? Why, in fact, did she die? Ms. Patterson received mifepristone on Sept. 10 from Planned Parenthood Golden Gate, a clinic near her home in Livermore, a San Francisco suburb. Erin Brooks, a clinic spokeswoman, said she could not reveal any details because of rules on patient confidentiality. The procedure for a medical abortion is for a woman to take mifepristone, which ends her pregnancy. Two days later, she takes another drug, misoprostol, which elicits uterine contractions that result in a miscarriage. The Food and Drug Administration requires that women be counseled about the procedure, sign informed consent forms and be provided with telephone numbers of medical personnel in the event of complications.
In the two years since the revolutionary drug Viagra reached the market, the medical condition known as erectile dysfunction has gone from something that was the seldom mentioned cause of hidden misery and embarrassment to the basis of a billion-dollar-plus industry. Last week, an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration recommended that a second oral drug, called Uprima, join Viagra on the market to help men get and maintain erections. And at least a dozen additional drugs to treat male or female sexual performance problems are being developed by other companies. The question is, why now? Is science suddenly at a stage where researchers can find drugs for erectile dysfunction? Are these drugs the fruits of the genomics revolution or advanced new drug discovery methods? Medical experts say the answer is more subtle. The emergence of a new class of drugs, they say, can have more to do with social changes than scientific discoveries. And, they say, the emergence of a market for erectile dysfunction drugs can offer a case study in how nonscientific forces can converge to give new drugs their moment.
Dr. Charlesworth's idea was that in the time before the age of reproduction, natural selection would insure that those who survived would be very healthy. But once an organism reproduced, natural selection no longer mattered, meaning that there would be no advantage to good health. To show how this plays out in human genetics, Dr. Rose points to two genes. Both kill with absolute certainty. One, which causes a disease called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria, makes children age so fast that by 5 they lose their hair, become wrinkled and develop cardiovascular disease. They look like little old men and women. And they die at about 12. The other is Huntington's disease. Symptoms begin when people are in their 30's or 40's, after most people have had children. They eventually die of severe neurological complications. But, says Dr. Rose, there are only a few dozen children in the world with progeria. There are tens of thousands of people with Huntington's disease.
But risk is a murky concept, Dr. Slovic and others said, and risk perception reveals a constant interplay between reason and emotions. On the emotional side, people will worry about a disease if they know someone who suffered from it. They will worry if they think a disease can be caused by toxins or chemicals in food, water, or air or by bioterrorists. These worries are ''the dread factor,'' Dr. Slovic said, and cannot be argued away by statistics. Studies of people who had brain damage that blocked their ability to attach feelings to their decision making showed that their lives were difficult and their decision making abilities fell apart. ''Feelings without reasoning can be very problematic and so can reasoning without feelings,'' Dr. Slovic said. Yet even within the reasoning side, there are complications that have nothing to do with statistics, medical experts said. Instead, they said, the question is how data on risk for a large group translate into risk for an individual.
Will it continue much longer? ''It is an extremely controversial area, and the answer is, We don't know,'' said Dr. Richard J. Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging. Some worry, for example, that today's fat children will grow up to be tomorrow's heart disease and diabetes patients, destroying the nation's gains in health and well-being. ''It is very legitimate to be concerned about levels of overweight and obesity in kids,'' said David Williamson, a senior biomedical research scientist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ''But at the same time, those levels of obesity are overlaid on improvements in health in children, which also affect long-term health and longevity.'' An Uncertain Future The mixed picture has led to disparate views about what is likely to occur. S. Jay Olshansky, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Illinois at Chicago, predicted in The New England Journal of Medicine that obesity would lead to so much diabetes and heart disease that life expectancy would ''level off or even decline within the first half of this century.''
For example, if an anthrax patient who was given captopril died of shock, it could be that captopril hastened death, or even caused it by lowering blood pressure. Or it could be that captopril and antibiotics  were simply inadequate and the anthrax toxins killed the patient. But, said Dr. Jonathan Moreno, an ethicist at the University of Virginia, he can understand why doctors may want to give anthrax patients approved drugs like captopril and or ask for emergency supplies of experimental drugs like anakinra, for this unapproved and untested use. ''It's a very tough call,'' Dr. Moreno said. In the meantime, scientists who simply want to know if their experimental drugs work in animals say they are facing endless frustration. Dr. John Collier at Harvard Medical School, for example, has found two promising drugs that may block the deadly toxin released by anthrax bacteria. But scientists at Fort Detrick can give him no date when they may be able test them in animals, even rodents.
The report was provided to The New York Times by an organization that consults in the breast implant matter and, a spokesman said, that ''is pleased with the report's conclusions.'' The report is the latest in a series of evaluations that have concluded that there is no scientific evidence to support the lawsuits. Because it comes from the Institute of Medicine, the medical arm of the National Academy of Sciences, the nation's most prestigious scientific organization, it is expected to be influential in setting scientific agendas and encouraging women to accept settlements from implant makers rather than take their cases to court. In preparing the report, panel members held public hearings, met in private and evaluated more than a thousand research reports. The Institute panel did not conduct any original research. Rather, the panel relied primarily on research and other materials reported by scientists and submitted by companies and advocates for women with implants. But the report said that since lawsuits were first filed in the late 1980's and early 1990's, there have been many scientific studies upon which to make an evaluation.
Ms. Morgan said she lobbied Blue Shield for three months before the company agreed to pay. Dr. Nancy Stalker, the director of pharmacy services at Blue Shield of California, said the company wanted patients to get the care they needed, but had a policy restricting payments for drugs that also were nutritional supplements. Doctors who treat patients in similar circumstances say they often end up imploring insurance companies to pay for the prescription drugs. Dr. Susan Winters, a geneticist who treats children with rare metabolic disorders, said she aggressively fought for insurance coverage for drugs like L-carnitine, but said she did not always win. Ms. Meyers said that drug companies realized that testing a drug and getting the F.D.A.'s approval to market it might not be worthwhile if the drug could also be sold as a supplement. With zinc acetate, she said, her group actively sought a company to sell the product as a drug. ''Nobody would do it,'' Ms. Meyers said. ''Who wants to put the money into making a pharmaceutical grade zinc when you can buy zinc over the counter?'' Finally, she said, Teva agreed to do it.
Poor residents of Ibadan, Nigeria, are much less likely to develop Alzheimer's disease than blacks living in Indianapolis, researchers are reporting. And that, they say, may mean that some factor other than genetics -- high blood pressure, for example, or diet -- may determine whether susceptible people develop the devastating brain disease. The question of what causes Alzheimer's intrigues researchers hoping to find simple ways to prevent the disease, whose relentless mental decline afflicts four million Americans. In the United States, an estimated 10 percent of the population has Alzheimer's disease by the age of 65 and nearly half have it by the age of 85, according to the Alzheimer's Association. The disease causes brain damage, with areas of dead and dying nerve cells tangled with fragments of a protein, amyloid. Scientists have found genes that can raise people's risk of developing the disease, but they also seek to identify other factors that determine who gets the disease and who does not.
It found no evidence, for example, that routine pelvic, rectal and testicular exams made any difference in overall survival rates for those with no symptoms of illness. It warned that such tests can lead to false alarms, necessitating a round of expensive and sometimes risky follow-up tests. And even many tests that are useful, like cholesterol and blood pressure checks, need not be done every year, it said in reports to doctors, policy makers and the public. But if the annual physical is largely obsolete, hardly anyone has gotten the message. While the federal Medicare program does not pay for routine checkups -- by law, it is limited to treating illness -- many insurance companies do, saying their customers continue to demand them. Many doctors say they perform them out of habit or out of a conviction that patients expect them and that they help establish trust. Even doctors who know all about the evidence-based guidelines for preventive medicine say they often compromise in the interest of keeping patients happy. Dr. John K. Min, an internist in Burlington, N.C., tells the story of a 72-year-old patient who came to him for her annual physical, knowing exactly what tests she wanted.
The death rate from influenza rose markedly in the 1990's, federal scientists reported yesterday. The explanation, they said, is that a greater proportion of the population is elderly and thus particularly susceptible to flu. There was an average of 36,000 flu deaths a year in the 1990's as compared to 20,000 a year in previous decades, the investigators, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reported in a paper being published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Ninety percent of influenza deaths were in people 65 and older, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the principal researcher for the study. But Dr. Fukuda and his colleagues reported that the virus was especially deadly in people over 85, who might be up to 32 times more likely than those 65 to 69 to die from a flu infection. Some questions were raised because the scientists used one statistical model to estimate influenza deaths in the 1990's and cited data for deaths in previous years that came from other studies using a different model.
While the danger to an individual woman was minuscule, the committee determined that it could not justify subjecting healthy women to the drug. The participants were sent letters telling them to stop taking their drugs immediately. Another part of the study is continuing, however. It involves women who have had hysterectomies and so do not require progestin to offset estrogen's tendency to elicit uterine cancers. These women are taking estrogen alone, and so far there are no findings that tip the balance in favor of overall risk, or benefit. Dr. McGowan, who is chief of the musculoskeletal diseases branch at the arthritis institute, said the termination of the Prempro part of the Women's Health Initiative was enough to stop a nearly completed study of hormone therapy in women with lupus, an autoimmune disease. That study, of 351 postmenopausal women, had begun with high hopes in the mid-1990's. Women with lupus are at increased risk of heart disease and osteoporosis, Dr. McGowan said, and at the time it was hoped that estrogen would help with both conditions. The study was investigating whether it was safe for women with lupus to take the drugs. Some doctors had thought it would make their disease worse. Dr. McGowan said the study was stopped because of the serious questions about the hormone's safety.
The side effects, however, were serious, afflicting 24 percent to 46 percent of the men and women taking growth hormone and including swollen feet and ankles, joint pain and carpal tunnel syndrome, which is caused by a swelling of a tendon sheath over a nerve in the wrist. It, and the joint pain, might be caused by the drug's tendency to increase water retention, Dr. Blackman said. But Dr. S. Mitchell Harman, an author of the new study and director of the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a nonprofit center that does research on aging, said it might be a result of growth hormone's effects in increasing tissue growth. In addition, half the men who took growth hormone also had impaired abilities to use glucose, developing either diabetes or a prediabetic condition. But all these adverse effects disappeared when the study ended and the men and women stopped using the drugs.
He provided a booklet of state requirements for facilities, including  specifications that hallways must be at least 60 inches wide, that hot water be between 100 and 116 degrees and that life-support equipment and an ultrasound machine be available. ''The State of North Carolina says you cannot give a woman an abortion unless you are in a registered facility,'' Dr. Schnider said. Dr. Diana Dell, a gynecologist at Duke University, said she had not been aware of the laws regulating abortions in her state, and she thought they would give many doctors pause. Registering as an abortion provider and making sure the hallways are wide enough and that the air flow meets state requirements is very different from what many doctors might have expected, Dr. Dell said. ''This is going to be very difficult for folks,'' she said. ''This isn't an analogous situation to writing a prescription. I think that there clearly is going to be case law written. But who wants to be the one to make case law?''
But as he read more and more, the professor began having second thoughts. He was struck by the way surgery was referred to as the ''gold standard'' in many scientific papers. He was also troubled by his discovery that it could take two or three years to know if the seeds had destroyed his cancer. The professor chose surgery, went into the hospital on July 9 and was home two days later. He wore a catheter for two weeks, which, he said, ''was a bummer.'' ''The idea of walking around with a bag strapped to your legs,'' he added, was not his vision of recuperation. When colleagues expressed surprise that he was not in his office, he replied he was working at home. When the catheter came out, he needed adult diapers. ''When you do your shopping in CVS and walk out with Depends, you pray from the incontinence section to the checkout that no one you know will see you,'' he said. He was lucky -- when he saw people he knew, it was immediately upon entering the store, so he would turn around and walk out.
It is not a popular argument. Dr. Rigel, reached by telephone in Hawaii, where he was vacationing, said it was perverse of Dr. Ackerman to pick the data apart. Melanoma, Dr. Rigel said, can occur ''where the sun doesn't shine.'' But that is because sunlight suppresses immune cells in the skin's surface that ordinarily hold cancer at bay, he said. He himself stays pale, even in Hawaii, that land of intense sunlight. ''I'm a dermatologist,'' he explained. Dr. Ackerman does not buy the immune-system argument. It is a hypothesis to support the hypothesis that sun exposure causes melanoma, he says. But it is not evidence. Of course, Dr. Ackerman adds, he could be wrong. ''If the evidence were compelling, I'd be the first to capitulate,'' he said. ''I'd say: 'I tip my hat to you. Well done.''' I BEG TO DIFFER
Dr. Linda Prine, a physician with a family practice in Manhattan, openly supports abortion rights. She has signs and buttons around her office saying so, and she tells her patients that she works one day a week at a Planned Parenthood abortion clinic. So it may come as no surprise to Dr. Prine's patients that she plans to provide the newly approved abortion pill mifepristone, or RU-486. But patients may not expect the reaction they will get if they call her office and say they want a pill-induced abortion. Wary about abortion opponents, Dr. Prine plans to set up a system that she learned from doctors who provided mifepristone in clinical trials. She explains how it will work: ''If a patient calls and says, 'I'm interested in getting a medical abortion,' the front desk staff says, 'Call this number.' They give a beeper number for me. I call the patients back on a cell phone that blocks caller ID. Then I screen the patients,'' she said.
IT was a quandary all too familiar to cardiologists. Here was a middle-aged man who might -- or might not -- be on the verge of developing heart disease. His cholesterol was fine, but many people who develop heart disease have normal cholesterol levels. His blood pressure was fine. He did not smoke. But his family history was sobering. His father had developed diabetes and high blood pressure and ended up with two bypass operations. His father's father had suffered a heart attack. So Dr. Michael Lauer, the patient's cardiologist and the director of clinical research at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, asked himself: How aggressively do I treat this man? Or does he need treatment at all? Dr. Lauer turned to a test that is only now entering clinical practice but that can be as powerful as cholesterol levels in predicting risk of heart disease and sudden death. He put his patient -- Dr. Mark Kreindel, himself a cardiologist -- on a treadmill, then measured how quickly his heart beat returned to its usual rate after exercise.
Last week, in The New England Journal of Medicine, a paper by researchers in Amsterdam gave a taste of the future. It indicated that breast tumors appear to have genetic signatures -- the pattern of activity of 70 genes -- that predict whether a tumor is going to prove lethal, despite treatment, or not. The researchers found signatures in all the tumors they examined, large and small. Researchers cautioned that such genetic signature studies were fraught with methodological difficulties. This one, while larger than many and avoiding some pitfalls, must be confirmed in studies with larger numbers of women who are followed for years to see if the signature is predictive and, if so, if it is as powerful a predictor as it seems in initial studies. The signature is not an inherited gene and the study says nothing about whether a woman whose mother, for example, died of breast cancer will be likely to die herself if she develops the disease. Instead, it is a property of the individual tumor in an individual woman's breast that may be a combination of chance mutations with genetic inheritance but whose origins are not yet known.
Perhaps, some researchers reasoned, the time to test was at a year of age. Then the innocuous cancers might have gone away on their own and the bad ones would be starting to emerge. In Germany, Dr. Freimut H. Schilling of Olgahospital in Stuttgart and his colleagues put this hypothesis to the test, offering neuroblastoma screening to the 2,581,188 children in 6 German states who turned 1 from 1995 to 2000 and not offering it to the 2,117,600 children of the same age in the remaining 10 states. The results, the researchers report, were the same as in the Quebec study, with a large increase in cancers diagnosed by screening but no concomitant decline in the death rate. The German researchers wrote that in two-thirds of the cases they found, or 99 of 149, cancers would have disappeared on their own. While there had always been a few isolated reports of children with neuroblastoma whose cancers spontaneously regressed, most doctors had thought they were rare exceptions.
All this points to troubling realities in the calculus of risk versus benefit. What if you are at high risk of colon cancer? Do you take Celebrex? Or what if you have arthritis and end up with a choice of a drug that can cause ulcers and heart attacks or one that confers a greater risk of heart attacks, but does not cause ulcers? ''This is where it all becomes murky,'' said Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, the director of the Cancer Research Center at Brigham Young University and a discoverer of the COX-2 enzyme. The discovery led to the development of Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra, the drugs that block the enzyme. And what if you are a drug company, wondering whether to pour money into a long study of a drug that might prevent cancer? The Vioxx and Celebrex stories illustrate the chance a company takes. Pfizer still sells Celebrex, but stock prices in both companies plummeted with the news of their drugs' risks, and Merck faces a raft of patients' lawsuits.
A third option is seeds, which are inserted into the prostate with needles, each containing 20 to 30 radioactive pellets. The prostate swells temporarily after the seeds are implanted and the patient may need a catheter for a few days. He can become impotent -- that chance is not as well quantified as it is with surgery and external beam radiation -- and might have problems with blockages in the urethra. Another complication with seeds is that success depends on the skill of the doctor implanting them. ''They could be dropped outside the prostate and cause damage to the rectum,'' Dr. Albertsen said. Until earlier this month, there was no rigorous study showing that treating early prostate cancer prevented deaths from the cancer. But a project in Sweden, involving 695 men who were randomly assigned to have their prostates removed or to forgo treatment, found that the men who had surgery were less likely to die of prostate cancer in the ensuing 6.2 years. The study, however, left unanswered questions. The overall death rate was unchanged -- about the same number of men died in each group, possibly because a man who was saved from a prostate cancer death might have died of another disease anyway, like a stroke or a heart attack.
Virologists are chilled by the statistics from the 1918 flu, which killed  mostly people age 20 to 40. If such a  plague came today, killing a similar fraction of the United States population, 1.5 million Americans would die. It would kill more Americans in a single year than die annually from heart disease, cancers, strokes, chronic pulmonary disease, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease combined. Finding the secret of the 1918 flu has been the ultimate goal of Dr.  Taubenberger's meticulous work, which has riveted the attention of influenza experts. He expects to complete his genetic analysis, getting the sequence of all eight of the virus's genes, by the end of the year. It may be, Dr. Taubenberger said, that even when every gene of the virus is known, there will be no answers; perhaps it was many small changes that combined to make the virus a killer. Dr. John Oxford, a virologist at Royal London Hospital, said he suspected that there was an obvious genetic reason why the virus was so lethal. But Dr. Oxford said that if the virus turned out to be mundane, if it was something about the circumstances, like the crowding and troop movements of World War I that caused the deadly epidemic, ''that would give us some degree of comfort because it's very unlikely that all these things could happen again.''
Although there were scores of mutations and widespread gene deletions and rearrangements, it turned out that the crucial changes that turned a colon cell cancerous involved just five pathways. There were dozens of ways of disabling those pathways, but they were merely multiple means to the same end. People with inherited predispositions to colon cancer started out with a gene mutation that put their cells on one of those pathways. A few more random mutations and the cells could become cancerous. The colon cancer story, Dr. Druker said, ''is exactly the paradigm we need for every single cancer at every single stage.'' But scientists were stymied. Where should they go from there? How did what happens in colon cancer apply to other cancers? If they had to repeat the colon cancer story every time, discovering genetic alterations in each case, it would take decades to make any progress. The turning point came only recently, with the advent of new technology. Using microarrays, or gene chips -- small slivers of glass or nylon that can be coated with all known human genes -- scientists can now discover every gene that is active in a cancer cell and learn what portions of the genes are amplified or deleted.
The scientists in Scotland who created Dolly, the sheep that was the first animal that was a clone of an adult, report today that the genetic material in her cells may show a sign of aging, appearing, in effect, older than Dolly herself. If the findings are confirmed, they  would be the first sign of possible genetic abnormalities in cloned animals. So far, cloned animals seem healthy and they are fertile, but a genetic disturbance could cast a cloud over the future of cloning animals, and certainly humans. Leading investigators said in interviews, however, that they were not yet convinced by the preliminary data, which are being published today in the journal Nature. The data are from Dr. Paul Shiels of PPL Therapeutics in Roslin, Scotland, and his colleagues, including Dr. Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute, who created Dolly. In their letter to Nature, the scientists report that Dolly's cells had slightly stunted telomeres, the tickertape-like appendages to chromosomes. Telomeres have been described as a virtual aging clock for cells grown in the laboratory, shortening with each cell division and marking off the number of divisions remaining before a cell dies. Moreover, the telomeres in older animals tend to be shorter than they are in younger animals.
But, asked Dr. John Evans, a risk analyst at the Harvard School of Public Health, Why should the level of background radiation matter to the question of how much additional risk from human-generated sources is acceptable? ''Why isn't the more relevant question, How much of this risk can be mitigated at what cost to you?'' he asked. The quandary over how to set radiation levels does not result from a lack of research or analysis, scientists say. ''Radiation's effects on people have been studied for over a century,'' Dr. Mettler said. ''There's a vast literature. There are probably more studies on the harmful effects of radiation than for any other toxic or noxious agents in the environment.'' And as scientists studied radiation, committees to evaluate the data proliferated. ''We have national and international standing committees that periodically review the world's literature on ionizing radiation,'' said Dr. Boice, who is a member of many such groups. ''At the International Committee on Radiological Protection, we just celebrated our 75th anniversary and we meet two or three times a year.''
Another study, decades ago, in which men took estrogen in the hope of preventing heart attacks, had to be discontinued because the hormone  was causing heart attacks instead. Those who hoped estrogen might benefit healthy women pointed to the studies showing that women who happened to take estrogen had fewer heart attacks than those who happened not to take it. They also noted that estrogen increased the amount of beneficial cholesterol in the blood, the HDL fraction, while decreasing the fraction of the harmful LDL cholesterol. But, Dr. Hulley noted, his study of women who had had heart attacks indicated that those changes could be misleading. Yet, investigators said, the Women's Health Initiative remains scientists' best hope of learning whether estrogen replacement therapy is helpful or harmful to healthy women. ''No one else is going to do a study this big on hormone replacement therapy,'' said Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a Stanford University professor who is chairwoman of the study's steering committee. ''If we don't answer the questions on hormones, they're never going to be answered.''
But David Jackson, a lawyer in Hackensack, N.J., whose firm filed for the patent on behalf of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center, said the question of whether to compensate Mr. Crohn and Mr. Fuchs never came up as part of the process of obtaining the patent. Patent law experts say that in the few cases like this that have gone to court, the outcomes favored the patent holders and not the individuals who asked for a share of patents. The most famous legal case over ownership of tissue involved John Moore, a man with a rare form of leukemia who argued that researchers in California took his cells, realized the cells made a valuable biological substance and patented cell cultures derived from his body. Mr. Moore sued, asserting that the cells were his property and demanding their return. But in 1990 the California Supreme Court ruled that he and other patients did not have property rights over their tissue.
No effect was found for glucosamine, chondroitin or a combination of the two. But the study found that the patients who took celecoxib had a statistically significant improvement in their symptoms. Although the new study found no overall effect for the supplements, the authors and some other medical researchers said that an analysis of a subgroup of patients provided hope -- although not definitive evidence -- that the supplements taken together might help some people with more severe pain. ''Patients who had more pain did seem to be helped by the combination,'' said Dr. Daniel O. Clegg, a researcher at the University of Utah School of Medicine who was the lead author of the study. But Dr. Clegg hastened to add that this observation would have to be confirmed in later studies. Dr. Marc C. Hochberg, the head of the division of rheumatology and clinical immunology at the University of Maryland, said it was also possible that another type of glucosamine might be effective.
''The New England Journal of Medicine is a de facto Good Housekeeping seal of approval,'' Dr. Forman said. ''It is not proof that screening saves lives,'' he said. But, he added, ''proof for a lot of medicine is not there.'' For now, said Dr. Robert Smith, director of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society, it may make sense for smokers or former smokers to have scans for early lung cancer detection. Patients, Dr. Smith added, should discuss the test with their doctors first, going over potential benefits and potential dangers. And they should be careful to go to a center that has the expertise and experience to do the scans and any follow-up medical procedures properly. But, he said, the new study adds to the information that CT scans might save lives. ''There is a lot of promise here,'' he said. And so, he said, ''it is not at all unreasonable for individuals at high risk of lung cancer to seek testing on their own.''
It depends, some medical experts said, and the question of how much, if at all, you should care is at the heart of a debate. The treatment, for instance, can lead to deaths from other things.One case might go like this: Say you had the operation, but it caused blood clots. Instead of dying of prostate cancer, you died of a stroke. At the same time, you are told that, while the surgery reduces your chance of dying of prostate cancer, the reduction is small, not enough to have an effect on the overall rate of death from all causes, including prostate cancer. What about that 50 percent decrease in the prostate cancer death rate? The actual numbers showed that 16 of 347 men who had the surgery died of prostate cancer, or 4.6 percent, compared with 31 of 348 who did not have the surgery, or 8.9 percent. Now, knowing that your likelihood of dying in the next six years is just the same, whether or not you have the surgery, but your likelihood of spending those six years impotent and incontinent is increased, do you still want the operation?
''I met with about 100 doctors the other night and I described this stuff to them,'' Dr. Berwick said of the array of ideas for improving care. ''They love it. They all want to go there. But you should have heard the concerns they had. They say: 'I'd lose my shirt. Many of the visits we have are completely useless, but I only get paid for patient visits.' ''It's discouraging,'' Dr. Berwick added. ''I know this is better for patients. I know it is better for physicians. I know the costs will go down. But whether we can get these changes made is anybody's guess. ''I tell the practices to just do it. But there is a very very cautious attitude that says that the status quo always wins.'' REMEDY FOR WAITING
Thirteen of the babies born to mothers who said they had been exposed to organic solvents had major birth defects, including congenital deafness, club foot and spina bifida; almost all of the women whose babies had these more serious birth defects had reported symptoms of exposure. Just one woman in the control group had a baby with a major birth defect. Dr. Khattak said that the findings offered strong evidence that these chemicals cause birth defects. Because his group knew the women's professions, how long they had worked with chemicals, and what precautions they had taken, he said, the researchers had ''a unique advantage'' in assessing exposures. But other scientists were unconvinced. ''They've added to the suspicion that there might be an association,'' said Dr. David Erickson, the chief of the birth defects and genetic disease branch at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. But, Dr. Erickson said, ''I don't think this nails it down in any firm way.'' To do so, he said, would require a much larger and more expensive study involving meticulous measurements of chemicals and notation of the time that women are exposed.
Also, the study compared students who chose coaching to those who did not, rather than randomly assigning students to one group or another. Still, some experts on educational testing, like Stephen Klein, a senior research scientist at the Rand Corporation who studies educational testing, called the work ''very important'' and convincing. More than two million high school students take the admissions tests each year, and 10 percent to 12 percent of them sign up for commercial coaching programs, which may cost $700 to $3,000 for a course or $450 an hour for a private tutor, according to the study's author, Derek C. Briggs. Mr. Briggs, a doctoral student in education at the University of California at Berkeley, based his conclusions on an analysis of data in a national survey by the Department of Education that follows a representative sample of students from eighth grade through high school and beyond. Mr. Briggs said he had no connection to any testing service or coaching concern.
T cells with the defective gene start to grow and then die. Any cells with a functioning gene will be fueled by the body's hormones and will grow rapidly to populate the bone marrow. Dr. Fischer said he began working on gene therapy for SCID-X1 in 1993, as soon as the missing gene was identified. He studied the treatment for six years in mice and in the laboratory before trying to treat patients. Last year, he said, he decided ''there was a serious chance that the treatment could work in this particular disease,'' and the success with the first babies is the result. Scientists, of course, were well aware that SCID-X1 and other rare genetic diseases of immune system cells would be perfect for gene therapy. In fact, the very first human gene therapy patient had a similar disease. The experiment took place at the National Institutes of Health on Sept. 14, 1990.
The result was a paper by Dr. Ali H. Mokdad and colleagues published in the medical journal that was controversial from the start, with some of the most vigorous attacks coming from antitobacco groups. But beneath the dispute lies a truth about science and its uses in an age of limited resources. If obesity is a leading cause of death, more money should be spent to try to prevent it, and to treat it. Insurers should pay for diet programs or weight-loss surgery. If it is not so deadly, some fear, the impetus to pay for such things might vanish. On the other hand, the more money that goes to fighting obesity, the less will be available for other programs, like antitobacco ones. ''The tobacco people are afraid that it's a zero sum game,'' said Dr. Eric Oliver, a political scientist at the University of Chicago who is writing a book in the politics of obesity. ''If obesity gets declared Public Enemy No.1, it's going to come at their expense.''
In September, Merck announced that it was withdrawing its COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, from the market after a clinical trial it was conducting showed an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes when patients took it for 18 months or longer. That raised questions about similar drugs made by Pfizer, Celebrex and Bextra, and the F.D.A. panel was charged with reviewing what is known about them. The Vioxx findings were based on the strongest evidence -- a clinical trial comparing the drug with a placebo. But no such evidence on heart attacks and strokes has been reported for Celebrex and Bextra. There is, however, a scientifically weaker study, pooling data from 12 clinical trials, that Dr. Furberg and Dr. Garret A. FitzGerald, a cardiologist and pharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania, completed recently. ''Basically, we showed that Bextra is no different than Vioxx, and Pfizer is trying to suppress that information,'' Dr. Furberg told The New York Times this week.
For years, doctors have been saying that to prevent heart disease, patients should pay attention to both the so-called bad cholesterol, or L.D.L., and the good cholesterol, or H.D.L. The good, they said, can counteract the bad. But now, some scientists say, new and continuing studies have called into question whether high levels of the good cholesterol are always good and, when they are beneficial, how much. While some heart experts are not ready to change their treatment advice, others have concluded that H.D.L. should play at most a minor role in deciding whether to prescribe cholesterol-lowering drugs. In the meantime, doctors are calling researchers and asking what to do about patients with high H.D.L. levels, or what to do when their own H.D.L. levels are high, and patients are left with conflicting advice. ''There is so much confusion about this that it is unbelievable,'' said Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic.
''If they had not responded, they would be put on medication,'' Dr. Lauer said. ''But in reality, they would be given that diet and in the vast majority of cases their cholesterol would not change and they would not be put on medication. This has been documented again and again. The new guidelines say go ahead and put them on drugs straight off.'' Diet, exercise and weight reduction are the primary recommendations only for people at lower risk, with elevated cholesterol levels but with less than a 20 percent chance of having a heart attack in the next decade. But even some of those people should take drugs, depending on their cholesterol levels, according to the guidelines. Some with particularly high levels of the type of cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, that injures blood vessel walls, might consider taking a drug. The last time the national panel issued cholesterol treatment guidelines was in 1993. So much has changed since then, heart disease researchers said, that those much less aggressive guidelines now seem to be of a different era.
Dr. Ridker said he would have been happy to find a benefit in lowering CPR levels that was only 10 percent or 20 percent that of lowering cholesterol, adding, ''We never dreamed we'd get a risk reduction as large as the risk reduction from lowering LDL cholesterol'' -- that is, the ''bad'' type of cholesterol. Dr. Nissen's study, sponsored by Pfizer, examined plaque in the coronary arteries of 502 patients with heart disease, comparing intense statin therapy against moderate and using the same doses of the same drugs as in Dr. Ridker's research. Intense therapy resulted in lower cholesterol levels and slower growth of plaque, Dr. Nissen reported. But he also suspected that something else was going on, because some patients seemed to be doing much better than others with the same cholesterol levels. Upon further analysis, Dr. Nissen found that levels of CRP dropped independently of cholesterol and that these reductions were independently associated with a slowing of disease progression. In patients who achieved low levels of both CRP and cholesterol, he found, plaque in the coronary arteries actually regressed.
The new analysis was designed to answer persistent questions about hormone therapy that arose from the Women's Health Initiative. Its two studies included 27,347 women ages 50 to 79 who were randomly assigned to receive hormones or not. One study involved women who had not had hysterectomies. They took Prempro, a drug made by Wyeth that combines estrogen and progestins. The other involved women who had had a hysterectomy and who took estrogen alone. Estrogen alone can cause cancer of the uterine lining and should not be used by women with a uterus. The main objective of those studies was to ask whether hormone therapy could prevent heart attacks; many doctors had expected it would. Instead, Prempro increased the risk of heart attacks, strokes and breast cancer, and estrogen alone increased stroke and breast cancer risk. Those findings were a shock to many women and their doctors, who had thought the hormones were an unmitigated good and who had considered the drugs a sort of fountain of youth. Even the name the treatment was given, hormone replacement therapy, gave that impression -- replacing hormones lost to aging. Researchers and the Food and Drug Administration no longer use the term hormone replacement therapy, but it persists in popular use.
Now, however, increasing numbers of experts say that view is woefully wrong. In today's society, where ever greater varieties of food, in larger and larger portions, always beckon, these experts have concluded that the only way for most people to control their weight is to be like Ms. Barton, exquisitely aware of food, planning their eating and planning exercise to burn off calories and never letting a day go by when what to eat and how much to eat and how much to exercise is not on their minds. ''How many people eat because they're hungry?'' asks Dr. James Hill, an obesity researcher at the University of Colorado  Health Science Center in Denver. ''We eat because it's 12 o'clock.'' While there are what Dr. Hill calls ''the genetic superstars'' who are naturally thin and who naturally stop eating when their body tells them they have had enough, ''the data suggests that they are in the minority,'' he said.
''It is startling to see a paper without age-specific death rates,'' Dr. Freedman said, because without them it is impossible to assess the scientists' conclusions that the increased deaths were solely because of more elderly people. The researchers also concluded that there were large numbers of deaths among the elderly from another virus, respiratory syncytial virus, known as R.S.V. As many as 78 percent of the 11,000 people who died from R.S.V. each year were 65 and older, the researchers concluded. In an editorial accompanying the paper, Dr. David M. Morens of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that many people who were particularly vulnerable to influenza did not get flu vaccines, the only method of preventing the disease. Many mistakenly believe that the vaccine, which is made from a killed virus, can give them the flu. Over the last few years, Dr. Fukuda said, just 65 percent to 67 percent of people 65 and older were immunized. Even when they do get the vaccine, he added, it is less effective in the elderly than it is in younger people. And there is no vaccine to protect against R.S.V.
Doctors attribute the soaring popularity of colonoscopies to several factors. There was Medicare's decision in 2001 to pay for colonoscopies for screening healthy people. There was an influential editorial published in 2000 in The New England Journal of Medicine disparaging the sigmoidoscopy as ''a suboptimal approach.'' And there was what many call the Katie Couric effect -- the publicity Ms. Couric received in 2000 with her televised colonoscopy. As a result, while most medical procedures in this country are abundantly available, this $2,000 test is entering the realm of rationing. ''It's a real concern,'' said Dr. John H. Bond, who is chief of gastroenterology at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis. Healthy patients at the center cannot have colonoscopies because the waiting lists are closed, he said. ''It's fine to say everyone should have a colonoscopy,'' Dr. Bond said. ''But we are talking about 70 million people. It is unclear whether that is even feasible in the United States.''
Many people expected the agency to follow the recommendation of its advisory committee, which is its usual practice. But the implant issue was particular fractious. ''This was a very visible product, and we had input from almost everybody and anybody,'' Dr. Feigal said. The debate did not end with the vote in mid-October. Two weeks later, Dr. Thomas V. Whalen, the panel chairman, wrote to the F.D.A. and asked that it not approve the devices because, he said, they had not been shown to be safe. He also sent copies to politicians. In November, the agency also received two citizens' petitions that asked it to delay its review. One was filed by the National Organization for Women, Public Citizen's Health Research Group and the National Women's Health Network and the other by the Chemically Associated Neurological Disorders. ''We thought well, if we can ask them to delay maybe there will be some more studies that come out that continue to tip the balance,'' Cynthia Pearson, the executive director of the National Women's Heath Network. said.
Dr. James Simon, president of the North American Menopause Society, begs to differ. Once bone starts being lost, it is time to think about taking action, he said, with the only question being how low should bone density go before consideration of treatment begins. He added that, in his opinion, if the drugs were free, ''the argument would largely go away.'' ''Fractures don't wait until you are osteoporotic or barely osteoporotic or osteopenic or barely osteopenic,'' Dr. Simon said. ''Fractures increase with decreases in bone density and once you fracture, you put yourself at a dramatically increased risk of a future fracture.'' Complicating the situation is the fall from grace of hormone therapy for menopause. Last year, when a large federal study indicated that the drugs were riskier than many had realized, many women stopped taking them. Doctors are now advising these women to have a bone density test. ''Women going off their hormones has re-upped the ante about whether some alternative treatment should be started,'' Dr. Simon said. ''It really is an issue now.''
''It's a very complex issue,'' said Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, professor of cardiovascular medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles. ''Entire conferences of experts have gotten together to try to understand the paradox.'' In surveys, doctors say they know the guidelines. The heart institute's Web site (www.nhlbi.nih.gov /guidelines/cholesterol/index.htm) has a program to calculate risk and appropriate cholesterol levels. Yet, said Dr. James Cleeman, the coordinator for the national cholesterol education program at the heart institute, ''there is underprescribing.'' He said that while 13 million Americans were taking statins, at least 36 million should be. Dr. Daniel Rader, director of the University of Pennsylvania's Preventive Cardiology and Lipid Clinic said: ''In this field, this is a huge topic of discussion. Why is it that when you poll doctors or give a talk, everyone says, 'Of course I know what the guidelines are. Of course I appropriately treat my patients.' ''
Amgen is now looking for compounds that can block the beta secretase. Dr. Citron cautioned that it would be several years before a potential drug was found and tested sufficiently in the laboratory and in animals until the company was ready to initiate tests with people. Weill's Dr. Relkin said it was impossible to predict how soon such a drug could be developed. But, he added, ''it is certainly exciting to be able to ask these questions.''
In the meantime, the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight Investigations will hold hearings on human cloning on Wednesday, with a witness list including ethicists and scientists.
''Think of it,'' said Dr. Joan McGowan, an osteoporosis expert who is also a project officer for the Women's Health Initiative. ''Here was a hypothesis that just a better diet could prevent breast cancer. How attractive was that?'' In the meantime, the notion that fat was bad and that low-fat diets could protect against disease took hold, with scientists promoting it and much of the public believing it. And a low-fat food industry grew apace. In 2005, according to the NPD Group, which tracks food trends, 75 percent of Americans said they substituted a low-fat or no-fat food for a higher-fat one once a week or more. So last week, when the study's results, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, showed that the low-fat diets had no effect, the study investigators braced themselves for attacks. Dr. Jacques Rossouw, the project officer for the Women's Health Initiative, said the researchers knew that some critics would say the women did not reduce the fat in their diets nearly enough. Perhaps a lower-fat diet would have offered some protection against cancer, Dr. Rossouw said. But, he said, ''what we achieved is probably what was achievable.''
The other attempts were at managed care systems for Medicare patients in Vermont, New Hampshire and Florida. But patients were changing plans and doctors so frequently that the doctors often did not know whom to call. Frustrated, they gave up. For most medical practices, which have a mixture of managed care and fee-for-service patients, there usually is no payment to doctors for phone calls, Dr. Wasson said. And so, he added, ''they don't want to eat up their fee-for-service time with calls.'' The same goes for other ideas, like e-mails between doctors and patients, said Dr. Donald Berwick, the president and chief executive of the Institute for Health Care Improvement, a nonprofit education and research organization in Boston that is encouraging the adoption of the new methods. For now, he added, having a good idea and showing it works might not be enough. A major stumbling block is how to compensate doctors. Some universities use research grants to pay them. At Kaiser, doctors who participate in group visits are compensated by being given extra time when they do not have to see patients. But, for now, the compensation problem can seem overwhelming.
''You can't impugn his career,'' Amory said. ''The testing has to be done right. I am kind of surprised that five days after the fact they are talking about the A sample without the B sample.'' CYCLING
In interviews, medical experts with different views on the test's value maintained opinions that they had previously expressed. Dr. Harmon Eyre, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, applauded the task force's report. ''It confirms the value of mammography both in women over age 50 and under age 50,'' he said. ''That in my mind is the message.'' Dr. Larry Norton, past president of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said he, too, advocated screening, starting at 40. ''On the basis of the total amount of information available,'' he said, his conclusion is to ''continue to screen.'' But Dr. Donald Berry, chairman of the department of biostatistics at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said, ''If there is a benefit, it is not very great.'' Dr. Berry is a member of an expert group, the P.D.Q. screening and prevention editorial board, which writes information for the National Cancer Institute's online database. It concluded in January that evidence was insufficient to show that mammograms prevented breast cancer deaths.
Dr. Michael Lockshin, a rheumatologist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, said: ''I've had a bunch of people say, 'I've been chasing down my symptoms and this is what I think it is and my doctor hasn't paid attention to me.' About 50 percent of the time when I see patients like that, they're correct.'' But more often doctors say they are peeved by the new demands being placed on them, frustrated in their efforts to convince patients that a prescription drug is not a poison or that a treatment detailed  on the Internet is not proven and annoyed when patients tend to believe the information from the Web is right and their doctor is wrong. ''If they take a drug and they have a lousy response to it, they will go to a Web page that says it's a poison,'' said Dr. Alan DeCherney, an infertility expert at the University of California in Los Angeles. ''You send them to the reputable pages but they don't want that. They don't listen because it's not what they want to hear.''
If patients get proper treatment within an hour of when their attack began, most, if not all, of the heart damage can be prevented. Only 10 percent get to a hospital that soon. Half the people who need to be treated to prevent heart attacks are not treated and half who are treated are treated inadequately. Patients go home with the wrong drugs or the wrong doses or misimpressions about the importance of taking their medications.

There was a similar whooping cough scare at Children's Hospital in Boston last fall that involved 36 adults and 2 children. Definitive tests, though, did not find pertussis. ''It's a problem; we know it's a problem,'' Dr. Perl said. ''My guess is that what happened at Dartmouth is going to become more common.'' Many of the new molecular tests are quick but technically demanding, and each laboratory may do them in its own way. These tests, called ''home brews,'' are not commercially available, and there are no good estimates of their error rates. But their very sensitivity makes false positives likely, and when hundreds or thousands of people are tested, as occurred at Dartmouth, false positives can make it seem like there is an epidemic. ''You're in a little bit of no man's land,'' with the new molecular tests, said Dr. Mark Perkins, an infectious disease specialist and chief scientific officer at the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics, a nonprofit foundation supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. ''All bets are off on exact performance.''
''It is very difficult for people to accept menopausal bone loss and bone loss from aging without trying to stop it,'' Dr. McGowan said. ''Since every woman in America is going to go through menopause and have accelerated bone loss, every woman in America is a candidate for some type of treatment. The problem we have in the bone field is identifying people who have a high risk of fracture and not those who may be perfectly normal.'' Opinions range from dismissing the condition as largely an invented problem to urging that nearly everyone who has it starts treatment. ''We have medicalized a nonproblem,'' said Dr. Michael McClung, director of the Oregon Osteoporosis Center. Most people with the condition, he said, have bone densities that are below average but not below normal. ''Only in Lake Wobegon is everyone above average,'' he said. While some women may need treatment, many more do not, he added.
Dr. Sirovich said she was taken aback by her study's findings. ''We were actually quite surprised,'' she said. ''These women are being screened for cancer in an organ that they don't have.'' The 10 million women having unnecessary Pap tests constitute about 12 percent of the 85 million women currently being screened, Dr. Sirovich said. No one is suggesting fraud or mendacity on the part of the doctors or laboratories. Instead, Dr. Sirovich and others say, the situation seems to reflect doctors' habits and women's expectations. In their paper, published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Sirovich and her colleague, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, analyzed national data on Pap testing and on hysterectomies over 10 years. Not only are most women who have had hysterectomies having Pap tests, they found, but the proportion having them also held steady, at 68 percent, from 1992 to 2002. No professional organization recommends Pap tests for most women without a cervix.
Even women who are genetically capable of growing big muscles can never grow ones as large as a man's, Dr. Kraemer said. When researchers biopsied the muscles of female bodybuilders, who spend hours each day lifting weights, ''They had smaller muscle fibers than the average male,'' Dr. Kraemer said. ''And these were women who were taking drugs'' to increase their muscle mass, he added. ''A lot of women are just sitting there with a 10-pound weight,'' Dr. Kraemer said. ''It's better than nothing, but they're really taking a second-class program. A lot of them are dramatically undercutting themselves.'' Even building bone requires that muscles be stressed, researchers say. They explain that bones have receptors that respond to demands on muscle, and weights can signal those receptors. ''Studies showed that stair climbing can help your bones -- but the women wore weighted vests,'' Dr. Kraemer said. If the muscles-like-a-man myth discourages women from starting to lift heavy weights, other myths can discourage women from continuing, physiologists say. These are the myths that lead women to expect too much from resistance training and encourage them to give up when the benefits do not emerge.
Emergency contraceptives like Plan B are sold over the counter in Norway and Sweden, said Dr. Trussell, director of the Office of Population Research at Princeton. In about 30 other countries, including France and Britain, pharmacists sell the pills without prescriptions, in a category between prescription and over the counter. In Alaska, California, Hawaii, New Mexico and Washington, women can buy the pills in a similar way. Individual states can allow sales by pharmacists, but the drug agency cannot, said Richard Merrill, a law professor at the University of Virginia who is a former chief counsel at the agency. ''Drugs are either prescription or over the counter,'' he said. The reason the agency is considering making Plan B over the counter is that its manufacturer, the Women's Capital Corporation of Washington, applied in the spring for the change. Another company, Gyn√©tics Medical Products N.V. of Achel, Belgium, also makes a morning-after pill, Preven. Its chief executive, Norman Proulx, said he would decide whether to seek over-the-counter status depending on the Plan B case.
He urged that doctors identify patients who need diets or drugs and impress upon them the necessity of following those treatments. Dr. Cleeman said the 27 panel members and consultants who developed the guidelines and the more than 40 groups that reviewed them stressed the importance of getting the message out to doctors and the general public as quickly as possible. While some experts involved in formulating and reviewing the guidelines have consulted for drug companies, the groups of reviewers and consultants were diverse and represented public health organizations, medical groups, nursing associations and consumer groups as well as an array of federal agencies. ''In our previous experience with guidelines in every field, merely saying, 'Here's a guideline,' does not equate with having them implemented,'' Dr. Cleeman said. ''We are taking measures to try to encourage the speedy adoption of these guidelines, virtually as we release them,'' he added, citing steps like providing summaries that doctors can keep on their desks and programs that can be put on personal organizers that calculate heart-disease risk and treatment recommendations.
The tests are easy to come by, with special X-ray machines springing up at hospitals and free-standing screening centers, offering scans for about $125. Small, portable bone density testing machines are turning up in doctors' offices and in shopping centers and drugstores, with scans that cost about $40. But the painless screening test and quick diagnosis by no means offer patients and doctors a simple answer. Osteopenia, it turns out, is yet another diagnosis that strikes at the core of debates emblematic of modern medicine, when screening can get ahead of treatment, or even the understanding of a condition, medical experts say. The stakes are particularly high with osteopenia because the number of patients is enormous. One federal study in which more than 14,000 men and women were screened estimated, conservatively, that osteopenia afflicts 13 million to 17 million women and 1 million to 2 million men in this country.
Lymphomas do not seem to be caused by radiation in any case, Dr. Boice said. But lung cancer can be, although the study of uranium workers did not find that. ''We would not have been surprised at these high levels to find a link with lung cancer,'' he said. ''But there was none.'' Dr. Thun of the cancer society said even though science might not support the idea that depleted uranium is causing health problems in Europe, that does not mean that scientists should turn their backs on the concern. People think they have leukemia because they were exposed to depleted uranium, and those fears will not easily go away. ''What I've been telling people,'' Dr. Thun said, ''is that we need a systematic, open and prompt evaluation of the situation, which would involve determining the cases of leukemia, determining the age of the patients, the diagnosis, and the type of leukemia.
She also had to stop the attack that was under way in the pancreas. That required killing the white cells that were doing the attacking. Her solution was to give an off-patent drug, BCG, that is inexpensive, $11 a vial, and approved for use as an immune system stimulant. It elicits the release of an immune system hormone, tumor necrosis factor, that kills activated white cells. After Dr. Faustman gave the mice the two types of treatment, the attack on the islets stopped. Then, to her astonishment, something else happened: the islet cells grew back, a development that went against everything known by scientists. The implications, Dr. Nathan said, were enormous. The diabetic mice, he said, had had extremely high blood sugar levels for weeks and would die without insulin. Researchers had successfully intervened earlier in the disease with these animals but not once diabetes was so firmly established. ''No one had cured them,'' he said. ''Here was this treatment that we thought would get them ready for a transplant but -- eureka! -- the diabetes was cured.''
The result, he said, is poor performance. While a high VO2 max, great efficiency and an ability to run long distances at the anerobic threshold are common in elite distance runners, few excel at all three. Dr. Morgan and Dr. Jack Daniels at the State University of New York at Cortland, for example, studied elite runners who were equally fast. Some would have a high VO2 max, but lower economy than their peers, or vice versa. As for the rest of the population, improvement is possible, but no amount of training can turn a person who is not gifted into an elite athlete. This became clear to one researcher, Dr. Robert R. Wolfe, when, in graduate school, he began running with Brook Thomas, a friend who had come in fourth in the Olympic trials. Dr. Wolfe, now the director of the metabolism branch at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, had run competitively in college. But running with his friend, he always lagged behind.
On Dec. 9, Mr. Wegele received a new  heart. A week later, Dr. Liggett said, Mr. Wegele was well enough to be sent home. The Scientists  From Impossible Task To Reasonable Goal Five years ago, when he was giving a technical talk to scientists, Dr. Eric Lander had a eureka moment. Dr. Lander, who is director of the Center for Genome Research at the Whitehead Institute in Boston, had assumed that it would be hopeless to even dream of finding the common variants in human genes. Gene alterations -- single chemical changes -- occur by accident, at random. Those with an immediate effect on health or fertility would be retained or eliminated by evolution. The other alterations would be neutral -- they would ordinarily make no difference to the person -- and so they would slowly become common as they were passed from generation to generation. With about 100,000 human genes and six billion people on earth, the number of common variations could be enormous. But, Dr. Lander realized, the human race numbered just 10,000 to 100,000 people as recently as 7,000 generations ago and a population that small would have only a modest number of common genetic variants, perhaps a few hundred thousand.
But all along, as more and more mammography centers bought the software, the assumption was that the computer would find cancers that radiologists would miss, saving women's lives. The new findings are likely to surprise radiologists, said Dr. Ferris M. Hall, a radiology professor at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Hall wrote an editorial accompanying the paper, which was published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. ''I was surprised,'' he said. ''A lot of people will be amazed.'' But executives at the company whose equipment was used in the study, Hologic, said they interpreted the results differently. If there is a suspicious spot on a mammogram, women will want to have a biopsy to rule out invasive cancer, said Robert A. Cascella, the company's president and chief operating officer. And the study showed that computer-aided detection was finding proportionately more very early precancerous growths. ''That's a valuable finding,'' he said.
''Do we know how to make islet cells? No. Do we know how to make kidney cells? No,'' said Dr. Shirley M. Tilghman, a mouse molecular geneticist, who is the president of Princeton. ''You can go on and on,'' she said. ''In the early days there was a cottage industry of trying to get them to do different things,'' Dr. Tilghman said. But the stem cells would never become just one type of cell, developing instead into mixtures of specialized cell types. Few outside the field realize the difficulty of working with stem cells, Dr. Martin and others said. When mouse stem cells grow in the laboratory, she said, some of them spontaneously change, with chunks of genetic material moving from place to place on chromosomes. She said that if such changes gave cells even a 5 percent growth advantage in the laboratory, the altered cells completely took over the stem cell population within three generations. And if such cells were put into patients, they could cause cancer.
Unfazed, Dr. Catalona began his own P.S.A. study with the support of Hybritech, in which any test result over four nanograms was considered abnormal. But that cutoff, the same as in the Hybritech paper, was adopted ''just sort of arbitrarily'' he said. The usual sort of study to validate a screening test would determine how likely the test is to miss a cancer that is there and how many times it points to cancer when none is present. But Dr. Catalona's test instead asked only how often cancers were found and how the men fared after treatment. In 1991, his findings appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine. That, said Dr. Peter Albertsen, chief of urology at the University of Connecticut, convinced urologists. Four became the standard. But some say it has resulted in way too much testing and way too many biopsies. Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine at Darmouth College and at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt., attributes the appeal of the number four to ''digit preference.'' Doctors, he said, like whole numbers, they like clear results.
Women who take hormone therapy after menopause and continue with it for 10 years or more may have a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, researchers report. But scientists, including the study's lead investigator, caution that the study's findings are suggestive, not definitive, in part because of the study's design and because relatively few women who took part developed the disease. For now, medical experts say, there is not enough evidence to tell women, even those at high risk of Alzheimer's, to take estrogen to lower their risk. The Alzheimer's study, by Dr. John C. Breitner of the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health System and his colleagues, involved 1,357 elderly men and 1,889 elderly women living in Cache County, Utah. The researchers questioned the study participants and gave them memory tests for Alzheimer's. Three years later, they tested them again. During that time, 35 men and 88 women developed Alzheimer's. Using statistical modeling, the investigators concluded that estrogen might cut a woman's risk in half, but only if she took it for 10 years or more.
When Dr. Peter Libby, chief of cardiovascular medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, talks to his patients about heart disease, he often has to start by disabusing them of a popular misconception. Most think cholesterol silts into arteries, blocking them like a clogged pipe. When, one day, an artery gets completely blocked, a heart attack occurs -- no blood is getting through to the heart. But the plumbing image is not only mistaken, cardiologists say. It can also lead patients to make disastrous errors in trying to protect themselves from a heart attack. Plaque is actually a pimple-like growth inside an artery wall. The pimples, stuffed with what Dr. Libby describes as a ''kind of chronic pus,'' usually grow outward so they do not obstruct the blood vessel for many years. But once plaque gets started, Dr. Libby says, it covers the walls of the arteries. ''It's likely that no part of the artery is normal,'' he adds.
It's the Hollywood heart attack, said Dr. Eric Peterson, a cardiologist and heart disease researcher at Duke University. ''That's the man clutching his chest, grimacing in pain and going down,'' Dr. Peterson said. ''That's what people imagine a heart attack is like. What they don't imagine is that it's not so much pain as pressure, a feeling of heaviness, shortness of breath.'' Most patients describe something like Mr. Orr's symptoms -- discomfort in the chest that may, or may not, radiate into the arms or neck, the back, the jaw, or the stomach. Many also have nausea or shortness of breath. Or they break out in a cold sweat, or have a feeling of anxiety or impending doom, or have blue lips or hands or feet, or feel a sudden exhaustion. But symptoms often are less distinctive in elderly patients, especially women. Their only sign may be a sudden feeling of exhaustion just walking across a room. Some say they broke out in a sweat. Afterward, they may recall a feeling of pressure in their chest or pain radiating from their chest but at the time, they say, they paid little attention.
After all, he reasoned, with his improved diet and exercise, he no longer needed the drugs. And, anyway, he had never taken his medications regularly, so stopping altogether would not make much difference, he decided. But the surprise was not what Mr. Orr had anticipated. On Feb. 6, one week before the appointment with his doctor, Mr. Orr was working out at a gym near his home in Boston when he felt a tightness in his chest. It was the start of a massive heart attack, with the sort of blockage in an artery that doctors call the widow-maker. He survived, miraculously, with little or no damage to his heart. But his story illustrates the reasons that heart disease still kills more Americans than any other disease, as it has for nearly a century. Medical research has revealed enough about the causes and prevention of heart attacks that they could be nearly eliminated. Yet nearly 16 million Americans are living with coronary heart disease, and nearly half a million die from it each year.
''How much information do we want, and what do you do with it?'' Professor Andrews asked. ''This is not like other medical areas, where there is a clear treatment. This has an impact on self-concept and on relationships with others. It is not a simple blood test.'' As many as one in three Ashkenazim has one of the genes, but those carriers are fine. The disease occurs just when a child inherits a gene from each parent. If two carriers of a mutated gene have children, each baby has one chance in four of inheriting the mutation from each parent, giving rise to the disease. Not every disease is like Tay-Sachs. Others affect some people who inherit two copies of the mutated gene and spare others, with no way of knowing who will be ill. Yet, the Tay-Sachs history has shown what is possible, said Dr. Harry Ostrer, a project leader. Dr. Ostrer, also the director of the Human Genetics Program at N.Y.U., said that before the Tay-Sachs screening began in the 1970's couples had no idea that they might have a child with the disease until it was diagnosed. The experience of watching babies suffer and slowly die was so sad that many of the parents never had other children.
Others, like Dr. Ned Patz, a professor of radiology, pharmacology and cancer biology at Duke University Medical Center, say they suspect that patients' desire for the tests may cool once they know of the risks. ''A lot of patients ask about it,'' Dr. Patz said. ''We counsel them and tell them what the data are. Then they are not interested.''
In a new report that is being met with a mixture of astonishment and sometimes disbelief, two Danish researchers say the placebo effect is a myth. The investigators analyzed 114 published studies involving about 7,500 patients with 40 different conditions. The report found no support for the common notion that, in general, about a third of patients will improve if they are given a dummy pill and told it is real. Instead, the researchers theorize, patients seem to improve after taking placebos because most diseases have uneven courses in which their severity waxes and wanes. In studies in which treatments are compared not just with placebos but also with no treatment at all, they said, participants given no treatment improve at about the same rate as participants given placebos. The paper appears today in The New England Journal of Medicine. Both authors, Dr. Asbjorn Hrobjartsson and Dr. Peter C. Gotzsche, are with the University of Copenhagen and the Nordic Cochran Center, an international organization of medical researchers who review randomized clinical trials.
''It's like taking a computer chip and putting it between a surgeon's hands and the tip of an instrument,'' said Dr. Michael Mack, director of the Cardiopulmonary Research Science Technology Institute in Dallas. ''You can scale up or scale down motion. If it is a 4 to 1 scale, for every four centimeters you move your hands, the tip of the instrument moves one centimeter. You can make a movement as precise as you want it to be.'' Still, it took time to learn the technique. Dr. Mack, for example, spent three and a half years perfecting his performance in the laboratory. ''You set up a box and do simple things, like learning how to tie knots,'' he said. ''Then you get a mannequin and work on that. You get a pig from the slaughter house and you practice on that.'' After doing more than 100 bypass operations on pigs and mannequins, Dr. Mack went to Germany to try it on patients.
In addition, about 20 percent of the women declined to participate. It is possible, said Dr. James Robins, a professor of biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health, that they might have included a disproportionate number of women in the early stages of Alzheimer's. Their exclusion may have altered the study's results if they were also more likely -- or less likely -- than the others to be taking hormones. Even determining who took estrogen, and when, can be fraught with difficulty. Dr. Norman Relkin, a neurologist at Cornell Medical School, noted, for example, that the researchers ascertained hormone use by asking the study subjects. ''Even a small number of women making a misrecollection could bias the results,'' Dr. Relkin said.
Dr. Henschke said it was the only question that was significant to patients. ''I can calculate a case fatality rate, but that is meaningless to people,'' she said. ''What is meaningful is that when I screen, my long-term cure rate is 80 percent. That means when you are diagnosed, regardless of the stage of your cancer, you have an 80 percent chance of living for 10 years. And if you find it in Stage 1 and promptly have surgery, your chance is as high as 92 percent.'' Dr. Henschke added that the new study and hers had similar data. The difference, she said, ''is that they were reporting it every step of the way in the most negative way.'' Dr. William Black, a radiologist at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new paper, said the flaw in Dr. Henschke's reasoning was her assumption that every untreated lung cancer was ultimately fatal.
The answer is: a lot and not enough. The 1918 pandemic showed how quickly an influenza virus could devastate American towns and cities and how easily it could spread across the globe, even in an era before air travel. It showed that a flu virus could produce unfamiliar symptoms and could kill in unprecedented ways. And it showed that a bird flu could turn into something that spreads among people. But the parallels go only so far, researchers say. For now, they are left with as many questions as answers. In the fall of 1918 flu struck the United States and parts of Europe hard and traveled to every corner of the world except Australia and a few remote islands. A few months later, it vanished, burning itself out after infecting nearly everyone who could be infected. The virus arrived at even the most improbable places, like isolated Alaskan villages. In one such village, Wales, 178 of its 396 residents died during one week in November, after a mailman arrived by dog sled, bringing the virus along with the mail.
She and her colleagues began by questioning other gerontologists, surveying 60 of these specialists at seven medical centers and asking them to define what, to them, were the hallmarks of frailty. What emerged was a consensus definition. Frailty, they agreed, was characterized by muscle weakness, fatigue, declines in activity, a slow or unsteady gait and weight loss. People with at least three of these symptoms were considered frail. ''These are pathologies that hadn't been recognized as discrete disease processes in their own right,'' Dr. Hadley said. But they were every bit as debilitating as well-known diseases of aging like osteoporosis. For example, he said, ''Everyone knows about osteoporosis, but quite parallel to it there is a tendency to lose muscle with age.'' Until recently, he added, ''that was considered normal aging.'' With their definition of frailty, researchers could then ask about its incidence, and, in this case, the Johns Hopkins investigators realized they had an opportunity. They were participating in a national study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, that would be following about 5,000 people ages 65 to 90 for a decade, starting in 1990. If they inserted questions about frailty in the medical exam, they could learn how many were frail at the study's start and how many developed the disease in the ensuing decade.
Dr. Michael F. Jacobson, the executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group, said he saw ''a real pattern of actions that undercut the public's health.'' He said of the plan to allow more health claims on food labels, for example, that Dr. McClellan was ''just ignoring the law.'' His group and Public Citizen, another advocacy group, have sued the agency over such labeling. Mr. Pines, the former assistant commissioner, said that while advocacy groups had raised objections and sued the agency no matter who was commissioner, the striking and reassuring fact was that ''the F.D.A. continues to make decisions based on the public health.'' ''Any administration coming in can certainly change some of the nuances,'' he said. ''But it's too big a ship to turn in a new direction.'' Correction:  January 27, 2004, Tuesday  A picture caption on Sunday about Dr. Mark B. McClellan, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, with an article about his agency's increasing boldness, referred incorrectly in some copies to the setting of a meeting between him and President Bush. It took place in the White House when Mr. McClellan was appointed, not at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
In the 20 years since AIDS was recognized, scientists have found the virus that causes it, have elucidated the virus's 10 genes and have developed an array of drugs that can thwart the virus when it tries to replicate. Experts say no virus, even polio, has  been more thoroughly studied than H.I.V. But the more scientists learn about AIDS, the more they find themselves confronting a mystery. The new research involves trying to understand how to make AIDS a manageable disease like mononucleosis or chickenpox. The viruses that cause mononucleosis and chickenpox remain in the body forever after a person gets infected, but the immune system usually keeps them in check. Could that happen with AIDS? And why can't infected people control the viral infection? Where in the body does the virus hide when it is under attack by drugs? The questions go on. Can the introduction of AIDS drugs be timed to prevent the growth of viruses that are resistant to them? Can a ravaged immune system be rebuilt? Can a  vaccine work? The usual vaccine would immunize people against one of the virus's proteins. But, said Dr. John Coffin, an AIDS researcher at Tufts University and the National Cancer Institute, the AIDS virus is like a Tootsie Pop -- a hard shell of sugar covers the good stuff inside. And antibodies, made to block the virus's proteins, can never penetrate its sugar shell to do their job.
Boca Raton, researchers agree, is a case study of what happens when people are given free rein to have all the medical care they could imagine. It is also a cautionary tale, they say -- timely as Medicare's fate is debated in Congress -- for it demonstrates that what the program covers and does not cover, and how much or how little it pays, determines what goes on in a doctor's office and why it is so hard to control costs. South Florida has all the ingredients for lavish use of medical services, health care researchers say, with its large population of affluent, educated older people and the doctors to accommodate them. As a result, Dr. Elliott Fisher, a health services researcher at Dartmouth Medical School, said, patients have more office visits, see more specialists and have more diagnostic tests than almost anywhere else in the country. Medicare spends more per person in South Florida than almost anywhere else -- twice as much as in Minneapolis, for example.
Her sister, she said, agreed, but one of her brothers had doubts. ''He was hoping she would just drift off,'' Mrs. Hollar said. Finally, she had the tube removed. Two weeks later, her mother died. ''It was not an easy decision,'' she said. ''But I don't look back, and I don't ever regret it.'' The Long Goodbye Previous articles in this series examined treatments for Alzheimer's disease and the prospects for prevention. The articles remain online at nytimes.com/health.
Warning of side effects, doctors stress that people should not take antibiotics unless they are genuinely needed. Cipro and drugs in its class can cause nausea and diarrhea and, rarely, allergic reactions, serious skin rashes, tremors, hallucinations, abnormal heartbeats and liver damage. Surgeon General David Satcher said he worried that if people started taking antibiotics ''just in case'' that they could do themselves more harm than good, encouraging the growth of bacterial strains that are resistant to the drugs. ''We do not want to lose this weapon,'' he said. A NATION CHALLENGED: OTHER MEDICATIONS
Sure enough, the next week it went away. Then there was the pain in the ball of my foot that came on after I had been doing a lot of running. Orthopedist No. 1 took X-rays and said it was a stress fracture. No running for six weeks, he said, then come back for a visit. I returned six weeks later, complaining that the pain was still there. I got more X-rays. It is healing, he said. Dubious, I went to orthopedist No. 2 who told me that I never had a stress fracture and that it was a soft tissue injury that would go away on its own. Sure enough, it went away a few weeks later. Then again, if it were a stress fracture, it would have gone away, too. Gradually, over the years, I began to wonder. Was the usual advice, telling you when to see a doctor, a little bit skewed? Might it be more useful to ask when not to see a doctor?
But unlike in adults, who as a group -- fat, thin and in between -- are heavier than they used to be, obesity seems to be preferentially striking children who are already overweight, making them fatter while the thin children remain thin. The result, said Dr. Katherine Flegal, a statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics, is an ever-increasing number of children who are classified as too fat and a bigger gap than ever between the weights of the fat and the thin. But, Dr. Flegal said, ''There really is no strong relationship between obesity and social class in children, as there tends to be in adults.'' In adult women in particular, she said, those who are poor or have less education tend to be fatter than those who are richer and better educated. Many fat children and teenagers find themselves isolated and subjected to the derisive stares and comments of strangers,  who assume that their weight problem is of their own making, weight-loss experts say.  Doctors say they are concerned about the long-term health consequences. A fat child may be a fat adult, they say, and prone to problems like diabetes, high blood pressure and arthritis.
Silicone breast implants cause fewer complications than the saline-filled ones already on the market, said a company that is trying to reintroduce the silicone devices. And, it added, the consensus among medical experts is that the silicone implants do not cause systemic diseases, like cancer or lupus. The arguments were made on Tuesday by Inamed, a maker of silicone breast implants, in a presentation to an expert advisory committee of the Food and Drug Administration. The company was trying to persuade the 19-member panel that data on the safety and efficacy of the devices was compelling and that the agency should be advised to allow it to market silicone implants after an 11-year hiatus. The panel will make its recommendations to the agency after a second day of hearings on Wednesday. The audience included not just scientists and doctors but also plastic surgeons who want to use the implants and women who said they had been made gravely ill by the devices. The panel included surgeons and medical specialists like rheumatologists, pediatricians, cancer specialists and an ethicist. Its acting chairman, Dr. Thomas V. Whalen, is chief of pediatric surgery at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J.
It is also unclear how to prevent soreness. ''You hear trainers say it's very important to stretch before exercise,'' Dr. Salmons said. ''But there were experiments in which people did exercise with or without stretching, and it didn't seem to make much difference.'' As for the techniques of weight lifting -- how often, machines or free weights, in what order to do the exercises, how quickly to lift a weight, how long to wait between sets -- the research is equivocal. But, Dr. Kraemer said, those are details that should not concern most people. Despite the fervent marketing of programs and the magical properties attributed to various regimens, there is little difference in the results of varying resistance training systems, he said. What matters is keeping the weights heavy enough to stress the muscles, exercising consistently and working every major muscle group. ''Think of yourself as being on a continuum,'' Dr. Kraemer said. ''At the beginning, when you are out of shape, just about anything can work.''
Whether the subjects started fat, thin, or between, the study showed that they each burned 1,360 calories per square meter of body surface per day. But when the volunteers ate so much that they gained an extra 10 percent of body weight, their metabolisms sped up by 15 percent. It was as though their bodies were trying to drive their weight back down. When they then ate so little that their weights fell 10 percent below where they started, their metabolisms slowed by 15 percent. And, Dr. Leibel said, his studies indicate that people's metabolisms never seem to permanently adjust to their new weights. But it is not just metabolism that changes if people's weights get outside their natural range, Dr. Leibel said. People who are below their comfortable weights are miserable -- ravenous, obsessed with food. Those above it complain that they feel sluggish and full nearly all the time and lose interest in food.
''We didn't sign anything; we're not on board yet,'' Dr. Caplan said.
Dr. Furberg said yesterday that he was surprised to be removed from the advisory committee. ''I had a call yesterday, out of the blue,'' from the F.D.A., ''disinviting me,'' he said. The agency, he said, told him ''the reason is that I have publicly expressed my views.'' The F.D.A.'s decision is not unreasonable, said Dr. David Orentlicher, a physician, lawyer and ethicist at Indiana University. It is analogous to situations in which potential jurors with strong opinions about a case are excluded from juries, and judges with such opinions are recused from hearing cases. ''It's a concern about open minds if you are asked to be a neutral, detached observer,'' he said. There is a risk, however, Dr. Orentlicher said, and it is the same one that arises in death penalty trials, which exclude jurors who are strongly opposed to capital punishment. ''You have to be careful that you don't skew the panel,'' he said.
And so Dr. Weiland started to drop his H.M.O. contracts over about three years. He said he has had no trouble finding patients. ''Patients sort of think that if you're out of the plans, you must be good enough to drop out of the plans,'' he said. The independent doctors say they see fewer patients and offer them better services. The doctors are easy to reach, patients are not kept on hold, and no one has to wait weeks for an appointment. Dr. Bradley Fenton, a Philadelphia internist who does not accept payments from H.M.O.'s, says he offers ''time and attention.'' He reserves an hour for a new patient who comes in for a physical examination and allows 15 to 20 minutes for follow-up visits. ''While it may cost more,'' Dr. Fenton said,  ''many can afford it if they want to. Instead of going out to dinner one night one week, they can spend an hour with me.''
Some, like David Vladeck, a lawyer who heads the litigation group for Public Citizen, a consumer advocacy group, say that there are real questions here, but that does not mean the answer is to deregulate. ''Given the resources that the agency and the industry have devoted to this issue, I would be astonished if nothing comes of it,'' Mr. Vladeck said. ''I know Dan Troy. He's a bright and engaging guy. But he's not just spinning his wheels.'' But Mr. Troy said he was merely opening to the public what might otherwise be a private discussion within the agency. ''The irony is, some who criticize us for doing it are in favor of public participation,'' he said. ''The further irony is, It is not as if these questions would go away if we didn't ask them. We would just have to wrestle with them within the agency.''
Dr. Ron Livesey was fat, tired and out of shape. At 49, he felt that his best years were behind him. So one day seven years ago, on his way to a medical meeting, he stopped at a doctor's office in Palm Springs, Calif., for his first hormone injections. Early the next morning, Dr. Livesey was at the meeting, sitting in a darkened auditorium watching slides of technical data. To his surprise, he found himself alert, taking everything in. He continued the hormone treatments. ''People started commenting that I had so much more bounce and energy,'' he said. He lost 50 pounds -- thanks, he said, to diet changes and exercise made possible by the increased vigor. So Dr. Livesey, then an internist in New Hampshire, decided to go into business for himself. With a colleague, Dr. Joseph Raffaele, who went on a similar regimen, he founded Anti-Aging Medicine Associates, a clinic in Manhattan. They are part of a growing movement among doctors to offer a hormone replacement therapy that claims to restore the bodies and energy of youth.
Dr. Stephen O'Brien, a cat geneticist at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Md., said that coat color in cats was determined by how color-containing cells separate and replicate during embryo development, a process that was only partly genetically determined. Dr. Duane Kraemer, a member of the cat cloning team and a professor of veterinary medicine at Texas A&amp;M University, said he was glad the clone did not look like the original. ''We've been trying to tell people that cloning is reproduction, not resurrection,'' he said. ''This is a good demonstration.'' To clone, researchers at Texas A&amp;M, led by Dr. Mark Westhusin, slipped cells from adult cats into cat eggs whose own genetic material had been removed. When cloning works, the adult cell takes over the development of the egg, using its genes to direct the development of the embryo, fetus and newborn,  which are the genetic match of the adult that provided the original cell.
The recommendations, announced yesterday in Washington, were also posted on the Web page of the institute (nhlbi.nih.gov), a division of the National Institutes of Health. An executive summary of the report was published in today's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association. Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the institute, said that if the American public took the guidelines seriously, heart disease could slip from its ranking as the nation's leading cause of death. ''It would no longer be the No. 1 killer,'' he said. More than a million Americans have heart attacks each year, and a half-million die from heart disease. The guidelines are intended to simplify the process by which people determine whether they are at risk for heart disease. The well-known cholesterol levels remain largely the same, but a formula has been added to them that clearly estimates an individual's chance of having a heart attack in the next 10 years. It calculates risk for men and women according to age, cholesterol level, smoking status and blood pressure.
Although advocates of abortion rights have been pushing for approval of mifepristone for years, it is not clear how many American women will choose it. The drug can be used only until seven weeks after a woman's last menstrual period, and just one-third of abortions performed in the United States occur at that stage, according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that researches reproductive health. Beyond that, side effects like excessive bleeding are extremely rare in first-trimester surgical abortions, and abortions are legal even into the third trimester of pregnancy in some states. Some doctors said they anticipated many women seeking an abortion would prefer the surgical approach, since the procedure usually is over in a day. ''There is no question that mifepristone is highly effective and there are good results most of the time,'' said Dr. Warren Hern, director of the Boulder Abortion Clinic in Colorado. But, Dr. Hern said, citing side effects like incomplete abortions, ''people have a way of denying these problems with the drug and saying it's a magic bullet. It's not.''
Vicki Saporta, the president of the National Abortion Federation, which represents about half of the nation's abortion clinics, said her group always thought that the abortion pill would have a slow start and that gradually its use would increase. That is what is happening, she said. ''This has actually progressed faster than some new technologies,'' Ms. Saporta said. Others said the pill had been a disappointment. ''It's not the social revolution that people predicted,'' said Ron Fitzsimmons, the executive director of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers, which represents about 150 independent abortion clinics. ''There were all these predictions that doctors would come out of the woodwork and offer it. We haven't seen it. We haven't seen people who do not do surgical abortions offer it. There were predictions that this would get the protesters away from the clinics. It hasn't panned out that way.'' A pill-induced abortion, doctors explained, is not a simple procedure. First, the woman is counseled, receives a medical guide and takes three tablets of Mifeprex, which blocks a hormone necessary to maintain a pregnancy. She returns two days later for a second drug, misoprostol, to expel the fetal tissue.
The risks of getting cancer from exposure to radiation increase with dose. But since a third of all people get cancer anyway, at some time in their lives, the problem is to find evidence that low doses of radiation cause cancers that would not have otherwise occurred. Even for people exposed to large radiation doses, like the 80,000 to 90,000 survivors of the atomic bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it has been hard to find excess cancers. ''They were exposed in 1945 and nearly half are still alive,'' Dr. Moeller said. Dr. Mettler said the latest data show that 12,000 of these atomic bomb survivors had died from cancer. He said the number of excess cancers in the group is about 700. Those data, Dr. Mettler said, show that there is a small risk of cancer with an exposure of tens of thousands of millirem of radiation. ''There's a group that says that if you can't see it, it doesn't exist,'' Dr. Mettler said. ''Then there's another group that says, 'That's nice, but it doesn't mean it doesn't happen.' ''
It is caused when a ruptured disk impinges on the root of the sciatic nerve, which runs down the back of the leg. And an estimated 300,000 Americans a year have surgery to relieve the symptoms, Dr. Weinstein said. Patients are often told that if they delay surgery they may risk permanent nerve damage, perhaps a weakened leg or even losing bowel or bladder control. But nothing like that occurred in the two-year study comparing surgery with waiting in nearly 2,000 patients. The study did not include people who had just lower back pain, which can have a variety of causes. Nor did it include people with conditions that would require immediate surgery like losing bowel or bladder control. Instead, they were typical of a vast majority of people with sciatica who are made miserable by searing pain. For such patients, fear that delaying an operation could be dangerous ''was the 800-pound gorilla in the room,'' said Dr. Eugene J. Carragee, professor of orthopedic surgery at Stanford.
The case for testosterone replacement rests on well-known observations: as men grow old, their testosterone levels decline; at the same time, they lose muscle and bone, their sex drive dwindles, and they may experience depression or failing memory. In younger men with medical conditions that rob them of testosterone, such symptoms disappear when they get the drug. So, some doctors ask, why not give it to older men too? But testosterone can fuel the growth of prostate cancer, and it increases red blood cell production, possibly increasing the risk of clots that can cause heart attacks and strokes. Those risks, with concerns about the cost, prompted the government in late June to scuttle a proposed six-year study of testosterone replacement. In the absence of such a study, answers about testosterone's risks and benefits may be a long time coming. ''The only thing we ever learn from medical history is that we never learn,'' said Dr. John B. McKinlay of the New England Research Institutes in Watertown, Mass. Dr. McKinlay is the director of the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, a federally supported study that follows more than 1,700 men as they age. ''On the slimmest of evidence we introduced estrogen to women,'' he said, ''and the public was whipped up to ask for it.''
Since no one knows the cause of most back pain, Dr. Hadler said, imaging is not much help. Nor are most treatments. ''Maybe you're better off not going to a doctor,'' he said. Dr. Deyo concurs that while a small proportion of patients may be helped by surgery, medical care may not be necessary for most. Surgery, too, is under new scrutiny, with a national study getting started at 11 medical centers. About 1,000 patients with the problems that most often lead to surgery will be randomly assigned to have surgery or not. The problems under study are herniated disks, spinal stenosis, which is a narrowing of the spinal canal that usually occurs with arthritis and aging, and degenerative spondylolithesis, a slipped vertebra. One of the investigators in the study is Dr. James N. Weinstein, a Dartmouth professor of orthopedics and community and family medicine and the editor in chief of Spine, the professional journal that published the Duke report in its January issue.
While healthy people are unlikely to be harmed by waiting, doctors say many just do not show up when the long-scheduled day finally arrives. ''If you're urging people to be screened and then you say, O.K., the colonoscopy will be a year from now, you shoot yourself in the foot,'' said Dr. Robert H. Fletcher, a professor of ambulatory care and prevention at Harvard Medical School. ''The meta-message from the health care community is, well, it's not that important after all.'' Medicare data illustrate the trend, with the number of colonoscopies among Medicare recipients increasing by 42 percent from 2000 until 2002, the most recent year for which data are available. In 2000, Medicare paid for 2,211,925 colonoscopies; by 2002 the figure had risen to 3,150,738. The data combine colonoscopies for screening with those for people with symptoms; before 2001, some doctors say, doctors encouraged patients to find symptoms like blood in the stool that would allow them to have a colonoscopy paid for by Medicare. Yet, doctors say, 2002 was just the start of the demand.
The task force estimated that for every 500 men who meet its criteria and are screened, one death would be prevented over five years. In comparison, the only test for colorectal cancer that was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial, the fecal occult blood test, requires that 1,374 people be screened to prevent one death over five years. ''This is huge,'' said Dr. Frank A. Lederle of the University of Minnesota and the Minneapolis Veterans Affairs Medical Center, who reviewed the clinical trial data for the task force. ''A major test for a major disease -- it just doesn't come along very often.'' Almost no one is screened now for abdominal aortic aneurysms, vascular surgeons say. Medical researchers suspect the true death rate is higher than 9,000 a year because often the swift deaths are attributed to a heart attack or stroke. ''If it ruptures, you're dead,'' Dr. Lederle said. Most bleed to death so quickly that they never make it to the hospital. And half of those who do make it to the hospital do not survive.
In similar research in other species, such cloning from embryo cells has been much easier than making a clone of an adult animal, or even of a fetus. But it was a first step for researchers, and it was the first time it had been done in monkeys. Success in cloning monkey fetuses or even adults seemed within reach. Since Dr. Wolf was planning to retire, the center brought in Dr. Gerald P. Schatten, an expert on fertilization, to replace him. Dr. Schatten hired Dr. Dominko and several other experts in embryo development to do the work. But after Dr. Wolf's success with cloning the monkey embryo cell -- which neither he nor anyone else was ever able to repeat -- Dr. Wolf decided not to retire after all. And he and Dr. Schatten ended up with competing laboratories, on adjacent floors of the research building, supported by the National Institutes of Health and focusing on cloning monkeys.
Some babies born from a new method used to treat a rare form of infertility have genes from three different people in their cells, researchers are reporting. But the researchers emphasize that the added genes appear to be of no consequence. They are of a type that does not vary much from person to person and appear to have no effect on a child's characteristics, the researchers say. They say that their patients' babies who were born through use of the technique appear to be healthy. The treatment has been used solely for a rare form of infertility occurring in only a small percentage of patients at fertility clinics. Women with this condition have eggs that can be fertilized, but the resulting embryos simply fall apart, dying before they can implant in the uterus. Dr. Jacques Cohen, an infertility researcher at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., reasoned that the problem might be in the cytoplasm, the material that surrounds the nucleus of the egg and that directs its development after fertilization. So, in experiments that began a few years ago, Dr. Cohen and his colleagues began injecting cytoplasm from the eggs of fertile women into the eggs of these infertile women.
The drugs appear effective for bladder, skin, and esophageal cancers as well. All these cancers make greatly increased quantities of cox-2. ''There are very consistent results across investigators, across sites, across agents,'' Dr. Hawk said. But, Dr. Hawk said, until recently there were two problems with taking the next step and testing the cox-2 hypothesis in large groups of people at risk for these cancers: first, the only drugs available then were ones, like aspirin or sulindac, that could cause bleeding; and second, sulindac's patent had run out and aspirin was sold over the counter, so drug companies had no incentive to invest in research on them. The situation changed a few years ago with the discovery and development of Celebrex by scientists at Searle. Like Merck, which has a similar drug, Searle was interested in the compound because it might help  the huge group of arthritis patients who needed an anti-inflammatory drug without gastrointestinal side effects. But scientists at the National Cancer Institute managed to pique the interest of Dr. Philip Needleman, co-president of Searle, on the compound's potential as a cancer preventive.
''We're confident in the science,'' she said, ''and that's what we've been building on since the last go-round 10 years ago.''
The results of such tests, cardiologists are finding, are surprising and counterintuitive: the steadier the heartbeat, the sicker the heart. ''If you were to ask people, 'Would you rather have a heart that beats irregularly or a heart that beats like a metronome?,' everyone would say they want a heart that beats like a metronome,'' said Dr. Daniel Levy, the director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute's Framingham Heart Study. The study, which began in 1948, has followed more than 10,000 residents of Framingham, Mass., collecting information on their health and heart disease. But the data from the Framingham study and others consistently show that the more regularly a person's heart beats, the greater the risk for heart disease. At the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Dr. Lauer likes to illustrate this to medical students when they visit the cardiology ward there. ''We go into the room of a very sick patient,'' he said, ''and I'll say, 'What was that patient's heart rate yesterday?' '' The students will look at the chart and give an answer, say 121 beats per minute. Then Dr. Lauer will ask them to take the patient's pulse. Invariably, the heart rate will be the same 121 beats per minute.
At M. D. Anderson, for example, more than 80 percent of the cancer prevention center's budget is for research, which can range from basic laboratory work to epidemiology to clinical trials testing ideas of how to prevent cancer, said the center's director, Dr. Bernard Levin. Most people who come looking for ways to protect themselves against cancer are steered to the center's smoking cessation programs if they are smokers: a third of cancer patients there have smoking-related cancers. They are also offered screening tests. Such strategies are hardly revolutionary, Dr. Gallo said. ''It's what we've been doing for years. But it's sexy to be called the center for cancer prevention.'' Dr. Otis Brawley, associate director for cancer control at the Winship Cancer Center at Emory University, shared Dr. Gallo's view. ''To be politically correct as a cancer center you have to be interested in prevention,'' he said. The government expects it and so do patients, he added. ''It is like a lot of things in medicine where we have implied success where actually there is very little.''
The study, being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, involved 54 people who were of normal weight and 73 who were obese. To assess leptin's safety, they were randomly assigned to inject themselves daily for a month with either leptin or, as a control, saltwater. Then the study continued with the obese subjects to assess leptin's ability to induce weight loss. The obese patients were also asked to follow a weight-loss diet. Leptin had little effect except at the highest dose tested, when two out of eight patients lost about 35 pounds each in 24 weeks. The others lost much less, and one gained nearly 20 pounds. The eight taking the highest dose were the remnants of a group of 18 patients assigned to take it; the rest dropped out after a month of taking leptin, complaining that they could not stand to inject themselves with several tablespoons a day of a substance that irritated their skin and was painful to administer.
As Dr. Rose thought about Dr. Charlesworth's theory of aging, he realized he could test it. He would force fruit flies to reproduce at an advanced age, by throwing away their eggs when they were young. The only ones that would survive would be those that could stay youthful and healthy to advanced ages. He would make natural selection work to his advantage. Just by doing that experiment, Dr. Rose said, he has bred flies that live twice as long as normal and that, like Dr. Kenyon's worms, stay vigorous and fertile as they age. ''I think I have produced a better fly,'' Dr. Rose said. ''They are athletically superior, they have a greater ability to do work and a greater ability to survive under stress.'' The only thing they do less well is reproduce at early ages. But, Dr. Rose said, ''we probably don't care about how well we can reproduce at age 15 to 20, which is what these organisms are giving up.''
Others say it is hard to let go of procedures they have used for decades. Dr. Barron Lerner, an internist and historian of medicine at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, says he asks patients to come in every year and always listens to their heart and lungs, does a rectal exam, checks lymph nodes, palpates their abdomens and examines the breasts of his female patients. ''It's what I was taught and it's what patients have been taught to expect,'' he said, although he acknowledged he would be hard pressed to give a scientific justification for those procedures. ''If a patient were to ask me, 'Why are you listening to my heart today?' '' he said, ''I couldn't say it's going to help me predict you will have a heart attack.'' Dr. Lerner is equally ambivalent about tests he skips. ''If you ask me, 'Why don't you do a neurological exam every time?' the answer is 'Because I don't.' ''
Last week, the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine published a report of a study on whether estrogen taken alone or combined with the hormone methoxyprogesterone can retard heart disease in women whose arteries were already narrowing. It was one of the first truly rigorous studies of the estrogen hypothesis. The women in the study were randomly assigned to take hormone replacement therapy or go without; they were followed for three years. Such studies avoid a pitfall of those that simply observe who chooses to take or go without a drug. Often, those who take a drug differ significantly from those who do not. Women who take estrogen are better educated, wealthier and more concerned about their health, all associated with less heart disease. As it turned out, no estrogen effect ever emerged. The study participants' arteries narrowed by the same amount whether they took a placebo, estrogen or estrogen plus methoxyprogesterone.
In fact, epidemiologists say, while Americans are fatter than they used to be, they also are healthier by every measure than they were in the 1960's and 1970's, when the average body mass index was lower. In the ensuing years, even as the public has grown heavier --15 percent more, on average -- heart disease rates have plummeted, cancer mortality has fallen, many fewer people smoke and death rates from auto accidents are down. People also live longer than back then, and when they do develop chronic illnesses, they tend to get them later in life. But such data may be at odds with the ''cultural resonance'' of obesity, according to Dr. Abigail Saguy, a sociologist at U.C.L.A. ''People don't like fatness. They don't like it for aesthetic reasons, and they don't like it for moral reasons.'' Even the language used to describe obesity is judgmental, Dr. Saguy said. ''Obesity is a health risk, like smoking, rather than a physical trait, like race,'' she said. ''It assumes that people are to blame for their weight.''
As Ms. Schlesinger discovered, those who search for medical information soon find themselves buried in it. And some find themselves duped, doctors say. Some fields, like plastic surgery, are almost magnets for misinformation, doctors said. ''There is so much plastic surgery on the Net,'' said Dr. I. Kelman Cohen, a plastic surgeon at the Medical College of Virginia of Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. ''Look younger, look beautiful, have a peel at lunch and go out shopping in the afternoon.'' One highly educated woman went to see a doctor who advertises widely on the Internet that he does plastic surgery. The man is actually an oral surgeon, Dr. Cohen noted. ''He says he is board certified, but he doesn't say in what,'' Dr. Cohen said. The woman wanted plastic surgery for her eyelids. Dr. Cohen said she ended up needing a skin graft from his group to repair the operation by the oral surgeon.
The most difficult situation occurs when the P.S.A. level is between 10 and 20. ''That is a fuzzy zone,'' Dr. Albertsen said, where it is less clear whether the tumor has spread. In that circumstance, a patient can be faced with deciding on a treatment that can have serious consequences, knowing that the cancer may have already moved beyond the prostate, making treatment to remove or destroy the prostate useless. Dr. Albertsen said that the vast majority of P.S.A. tests performed for screening in this country had scores that were under 10, but that picture is deceptive because screening has become so prevalent it is rare that men are presented with P.S.A. levels above 10 and it is even rarer that a level above 20 is found, Dr. Albertsen added. The most common treatments are surgery to remove the prostate, beams of radiation directed at the prostate to destroy it and radioactive seeds implanted in the prostate to eradicate it from the inside out. Doctors think these methods are about equally effective, but they have not been compared side by side.
''The problem is that everyone is looking for magic,'' Dr. McKay said. ''Academics are too.'' But, he said, to get to the next stage, when animals can routinely be cured of some diseases, like diabetes or Parkinson's, ''is likely going to take a new wave of technology or experiments.'' Yet, said Dr. Leonard Zon, a stem cell expert at Harvard Medical School, research is advancing rapidly, and in directions that can have even more impact than creating replacement cells. Everyone wants to help patients, said Dr. John Kilner, an ethicist who directs the Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity. The question, however, is, At what ethical cost? ''The core ethical problem is that this research requires destroying human beings at the embryonic stage,'' he said. ''It is a human embryo, it is not dirt or soil or some other materials and it is not just some cells. There are so many examples in history where people say, 'As long as we can convince ourselves that these beings are not fully persons then what we want to do is O.K.'''
Dr. Liggett knew that genes controlling the hormone norepinephrine make the heart pump more blood. Maybe, he reasoned, some people inherit versions of those genes that stimulate the heart too much. After decades of such overstimulation, the result might be heart failure. One of the genes, an alpha-2 adrenergic receptor, controls the release of norepinephrine in the heart. The other, a beta-1 adrenergic receptor, locks the norepinephrine onto heart muscle cells, making them contract. Laboratory studies led Dr. Liggett to suspect that alterations in the genes might be important in heart failure. The altered alpha-2 receptor might flood heart cells with norepinephrine, and the altered beta-1 receptor might make the cells respond more forcefully to the hormone. The gene combination, said Dr. Michael Bristow, a heart failure expert at the University of Colorado Health Science Center in Denver, ''is like a double whammy to the failing heart.'' Drugs that tamp down the genes' activities might be most effective for these patients, he said.
On May 4, he gave the chemical to Ms. Roche. She began feeling ill the day after she took the drug. A few days later she was admitted to the hospital, the air sacs of her lungs collapsing. Her lungs failed and she died on June 2, after weeks in an intensive care unit, tethered to a respirator. A Hopkins committee investigating the death reported last week that the hexamethonium was probably what killed her. And it found reports in the medical literature that Dr. Togias had apparently missed, indicating that the chemical might injure the lungs. If Dr. Togias had gone to the F.D.A. first, his study probably would not have been approved, some medical experts said. Asked if he would approve a study that, like Dr. Togias's, gave volunteers a gram of hexamethonium, Dr. Lepay said, ''I have a personal problems with that concept, but I don't want to go out and say what makes a decision on the part of our review division.''
Or, he said, ''if they work.''
At some clinics, Dr. Rawlins said, ''patients with good prognoses were given appointments immediately,'' while others ''were sent to the back of the line to wait for a year.'' Then there are the advertisements, like a recent one from Midwest Fertility Center offering a free seminar to patients with a ''free consultation to those who attend.'' The speaker was Dr. Caruso, described as ''a leading reproductive endocrinologist'' who ''has received numerous honors and awards for his research into infertility.'' That advertisement, Dr. Rawlins said, is typical -- and misleading. He knows Dr. Caruso well, since Dr. Caruso did his reproductive endocrinology fellowship at Rush and Dr. Rawlins was one of his mentors. Dr. Caruso said his honors and awards included a listing in Who's Who in American Physicians, a certificate of professional excellence from the American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists, and a research award from the Rush chapter of Sigma Xi, a national nonprofit group of scientists and engineers.
Those who extrapolate and make public health recommendations say that they have to make a judgment call in deciding when there are enough presumptive data to act. ''If we wait, we lose another cohort of kids,'' Dr. Hogan said. But sometimes well-intentioned advice is later revealed to be based on hopes rather than facts. Those hopes can turn out to be wrong. Take the so-called Mozart effect, that well-varnished notion that children who grow up listening to Mozart turn out smarter. The idea was so entrenched that the former Governor of Georgia, Zell Miller, provided Mozart CD's to new mothers. Florida's public schools are currently required to play classical music to toddlers daily. The science behind these two government practices was a study involving college students -- not babies or toddlers. On tests of special abilities the students did slightly better for 10 minutes after listening to music by Mozart as compared to their performance after listening to a relaxation tape or sitting silently for 10 minutes. No one tried to find out whether their brains were changed or even whether Mozart's music in particular made the difference.
Without knowing how the disease was spreading, doctors were at a loss to prevent it, and as many as 20,000 people fled the city. Some found their way barred. Hamilton left Philadelphia and traveled to Albany, attempting to visit his father-in-law. But, Mr. Greifenstein said, Hamilton was not allowed into the city for fear he would bring yellow fever with him. In the meantime, social and business life in Philadelphia was fast disintegrating. In one of the newly discovered letters, dated Sept. 12, 1793, Hamilton told of the ''undue panic which is fast depopulating the city and suspending business, public and private.'' ''Dismay and affright were visible in almost every person's countenance,'' Mr. Carey wrote in a chapter that he titled: ''General despondency. Deplorable scenes. Frightful views of human nature. A noble and exhilarating contrast.'' Afraid of contagion, people shunned their friends and acquaintances, Mr. Carey wrote. ''The old custom of shaking hands fell into such general disuse, that many shrank back with affright at even the offer of a hand.'' And, he added, ''many valued themselves highly on the skill and address with which they got to windward of every person whom they met.''
''You can be eating Total cereal, drinking fortified milk, taking a multivitamin,'' Dr. McGowan said. ''You can get into a situation where you're getting more than you need. Until recently, there was little concern about vitamin A and bone health.'' Now, she added, ''we may have to rethink the issues.'' Similar questions are being raised about other vitamins and minerals, notably iron and vitamins E and C. Researchers say the questions involve multivitamins taken by healthy people, not specific vitamins or minerals taken by groups with specific needs. Some elderly people, for example, may be deficient in vitamin B12 because they lose their ability to absorb it from foods. People who spend little time outdoors may require vitamin D, which the skin makes when it is exposed to sunlight. Even when older people are in the sun, aging skin loses much of its ability to synthesize the vitamin. Pregnant women who do not receive enough folic acid, a vitamin in fruits and vegetables that is added to enriched flour, are at increased risk of having babies with neural tube defects. Because the vitamin is needed at the very start of pregnancy, some advocate folic acid supplements for all who might become pregnant, just to be sure they are protected.
An influential federal advisory group plans to recommend in the next few weeks that all newborns be screened for 29 rare medical conditions, from the well known, like sickle cell anemia, to diseases so obscure that they are known to just a handful of medical specialists and a few dozen devastated families. But while no one argues with the idea of saving babies, the proposed screening is generating fierce debate. The dispute centers on how useful the test findings would be. Would going ahead with the full list of tests result in more good than harm, physically and emotionally? Or would it be better to forgo most of them? Proponents say that the diseases are terrible and that an early diagnosis can be lifesaving. When testing is not done, parents often end up in a medical odyssey to find out what is wrong with their child. By the time the answer is in, it may be too late for treatment to do much good.
Five years ago, Dr. Orkin, as director of a federal panel reporting on gene therapy, said that there were very large numbers of clinical trials ''many of which have been approved without extraordinary oversight in terms of scientific or clinical benefit.'' In an interview yesterday, Dr. Orkin said: ''There were a lot of people going around grandstanding and saying they could cure cystic fibrosis and many other things, which is a vast oversimplification. The awful history is not just the companies. Some of it, unfortunately, is the investigators and the academic institutions.'' Last year the festering discomfort many felt with the proliferating gene therapy trials came to a head when a teenager, Jesse Gelsinger, died in a clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania. The death brought investigations of all gene therapy studies and widespread cries that the field was moving ahead recklessly, with no success in sight. In an interview on Wednesday, Dr. Orkin said that the panel he headed  never questioned whether gene therapy would work, eventually. ''What we argued for was to do the research and to look for actual clinical benefit, which hadn't been demonstrated even in a mouse at that point.''
Some ask why take a chance. Dr. Philip Grossman, a gastroenterologist in Miami who is a consultant to the device manufacturers group, says he has challenged defenders of reuse in public forums. ''I said, 'You look me in the eye in front of this group and tell me you do it because you think it's better for your patients,' '' he said. But others say that the debate can best be advanced by actual data on safety. Some medical groups, as well as a device maker, have done their own studies, asking whether medical devices can be safely cleaned, sterilized, and reused. Patricia Davis, an electrical engineer and senior patent attorney at Boston Scientific, a leading device maker, says her company has evidence that devices often are contaminated and degraded when they are re-processed. The company takes reprocessed devices off hospital shelves and sends them to independent labs for testing, Ms. Davis said. ''In all cases,'' she said, ''at least 45 percent of the devices have come back contaminated.'' In one instance the F.D.A. and Vanguard said they independently tested devices from a lot that Boston Scientific had said was contaminated. But the F.D.A. and Vanguard tests found that the devices were sterile.
Dr. Lois Swirsky Gold, who directs the carcinogenic potency project at the University of California at Berkeley, notes that Erin Brockovich is billed as fiction. So she has one wish for its audiences. ''They should ask, does the science support the conclusion?'' she said. REFLECTIONS
''We need to convey to decision makers that a study should be moved on as quickly as possible so that we can understand the benefits and risks of this technology,'' Dr. Berg said. Some advocates of the technology, however, said it would be unjustified to deny it to people at high risk of lung cancer. Dr. Claudia I. Henschke of the Weill Medical College of Cornell University in Manhattan, said a study that randomly assigned people to be screened with the new technology or to forgo such screening would be unacceptable. ''You're condemning the control arm,'' Dr. Henschke said. And Margaret McCarthy, executive director of the Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, said she was sure that every person in the room would seek out the new test for themselves if they were at risk of lung cancer. Who, then, she asked, would be willing to be in a study where they might not get the screening test?
Dr. Wray said that since the study's publication, some surgeons had assumed that the subjects had only pain and no other symptoms. Those surgeons argue that the operation remains effective for patients with symptoms like the knee's popping or giving way, as well as pain. But, Dr. Wray said, 172 of the 180 patients in the study had such symptoms in addition to pain, and those who had the surgery fared no better than those in the placebo group. The new advisory from the V.A. said a panel of medical experts would look beyond the study to a broader context, evaluating the use of the operation in patients with a variety of conditions. These include injuries to the structure of the knee, like tears to ligaments or to the meniscus, a pad of cushioning tissue. In the meantime, Dr. Perlin said, patients with such injuries will continue to have the surgery.
Barbara Balaban, one of the leaders of the Long Island advocates for the study, said she and others pushed for it because of what they had noticed on Long Island. It seemed to them that an extraordinary number of their neighbors, friends and relatives living in Nassau and Suffolk Counties had gotten the disease. ''We didn't know as much then,'' she said. ''We were only aware of what was happening in our neighborhoods. That is an observation, not necessarily a scientific description.'' That observation led the women to action. ''When we started, it was great that people were talking about a really high incidence. That did catch peoples' attention and fan the flames,'' Ms. Balaban said. ''We went to legislators and made a big issue out of it. We thought maybe it was something in the environment.'' But the advocates know that misinformation persists. Ms. Balaban says that when she hears the 30 percent figure, she tries to correct it. ''Whenever it comes up in discussion, we say, 'Listen, that is not what is going on,' '' Ms. Balaban said.
There was a biological rationale for why it might be so: Fiber makes the stool more bulky. A bulkier stool will dilute the cancer-causing substances that are in foods and that are excreted in the stool, sparing the colon an assault by these chemicals. Fiber also makes the stool move faster, an effect that should reduce the time that the colon is in contact with cancer-causing chemicals in the stool. Biochemical data added support to the hypothesis: Fiber binds bile acids, which are chemicals produced by the liver and secreted into the bowel. Bile acids can damage cells and possibly cause cancer. The more fat that people eat, the more bile acids they secrete. So a low-fat diet might work with a high-fiber one to protect against colon cancer, researchers thought. In addition, fiber is metabolized in the intestines to produce a class of short-chain fatty acids that seem to protect against carcinogens.
The testing made two assumptions: that a positive test meant a baby had the disease, and that the special diet was safe and effective. ''Both were stone cold wrong,'' Dr. Fost said. Some babies testing positive did not have PKU. Although no one knew it at the time, these babies had a different mutation that was of no clinical significance. And the special diet could be as dangerous to these normal babies as a regular diet was to babies with PKU. ''If you give a normal kid a diet without enough phenylalanine, not only is there brain damage but every cell in the body is malnourished,'' Dr. Fost said. ''Normal kids became brain-damaged. Many died.'' In the mid-1960's, the American Academy of Pediatrics wrote a letter to the secretary of health, education and welfare, Dr. Fost said. ''They said: 'There is a big problem here. We don't know what a true positive test means. We can't distinguish a true positive from a false positive, and we don't know what the right dose of the diet is. Mandatory screening programs should be stopped.'''
Every commentator, it seems, has an answer to why fat children are getting fatter: too much television, parents who cannot say no when a child wants a super-size soda, ever-growing portions of food or too little physical education in schools. But many scientists say the reasons are unknown, so answers are mainly speculation. Whatever the cause, obesity in children is now so common that some experts, like Dr. Robinson, say that they are becoming inured. ''Ten, 15 years ago, the people who were showing up for treatment were 40 percent overweight,'' Dr. Robinson said. Now, he said, the children he treats are averaging 80 percent overweight, meaning that if the average weight for a child at a certain age and height is 100 pounds, the average overweight child treated by Dr. Robinson would weigh 180. ''I think people's opinions of what is overweight has changed,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''I find myself looking at a kid and saying, 'They don't look so overweight.' Then I calculate it and they're 50 percent overweight.''
Some experts on patent law say it would be unfortunate if patients start demanding financial rewards for participating in genetic research. ''I hate to create incentives that would lead people to get greedy,'' said Rebecca Eisenberg, a patent law expert at the University of Michigan. ''I am worried that there are just too many mouths at the feeding troughs of pharmaceutical products.'' Other experts say the current system of awarding gene patents seems unjust. Dr. Robert Cook-Deegan, an investigator at the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University, said: ''We have a system where the research participants are treated as pure altruists, but everyone else is treated as a pure capitalist. I don't think that's quite fair.'' The problem, said Hank Greely, a law professor at Stanford University, is that the rules of the game seem to have changed. ''It used to be that when you were a research subject, you were doing it for free and you assumed that the people on the other side were doing it for free -- at least for academic research,'' Professor Greely said. ''These days, there is very little academic research that doesn't have some commercial interest, and almost always now the researcher has a potential commercial interest. Someone might say, 'Look, I'm willing to do this for the good of humanity if everyone else is, too. But if someone on the other side is going to make billions of dollars, I want some, too.' ''
Dr. Bouchard's group has no plans to tell its study participants what their genes reveal about their ability to benefit from exercise. But, Dr. Bouchard said, when he began his work and found that about 10 percent of the people he studied could never improve their fitness with exercise, he did inform some of them. These were people, he said, who probably knew what was happening. ''They did not improve their endurance,'' Dr. Bouchard said. ''They did not lose a gram of fat.'' While they may still derive something from exercise, a tenuous promise of possibly improved health can be a hard sell for people who want to look better or feel more vigorous. ''If you can monitor things beyond your performance, you may find good reasons to exercise,'' Dr. Bouchard said. ''If not, you have to be convinced that exercise does something good for you, even though you will be the last one to finish each race.''
And, Dr. Sergent added, doctors and patients tend to expect that an office visit will lead to a prescription. ''To go to a doctor, pay for a consultation, get X-rays, and then have the doctor say, 'What you need are six acetaminophen a day,' is sort of a downer for both the doctor and the patient,'' Dr. Sergent said. THE DOCTOR'S WORLD
Inamed said it hoped its studies would satisfy the government that its implants could be sold. The advisory committee hearings were held to allow a disinterested panel of experts a chance to hear the company and those who had strong opinions about implants. Over a two-day period, starting at 8 a.m. on Tuesday and adjourning after midnight, then starting again at 7:30 a.m. Wednesday, the panel heard presentations of data from the agency's staff and from Inamed and heard often emotional statements from more than 100 people, with widely divergent views. Many women who had had implants told the panel they were silicone victims, with serious medical problems. Others said they were delighted with their implants, including cancer patients who pleaded with the panel to let women have the opportunity to choose the silicone version for reconstructive surgery. The panel also heard Inamed's assertion that it had improved the device in the last decade, making it with a thicker shell and filling it with a more cohesive gel. The company said it had seen a rupture rate of about 1 percent a year.
Scientists estimate that 3 million to 5 million Americans are infected with the hepatitis C virus, which can smolder quietly in the liver for decades before erupting as cirrhosis, liver failure or liver cancer. Some were infected from blood transfusions in the years before the early 1990's, when a blood test for the virus was developed and came into use. Others got it from sharing contaminated needles. It can also be transmitted sexually. But there are also people, like Mr. Woodland, who neither used drugs nor had transfusions, who will never know how or when they became infected. Since it can take years for symptoms to develop, most who are infected do not know it. Some say that hepatitis C is a time bomb ready to explode in the next few decades as hundreds of thousands of Americans, most of whom do not know they are infected, become ill. Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former surgeon general, who has campaigned to publicize the dangers of hepatitis C, has called the disease a grave threat to public health. ''Unless we do something about it soon,'' he has written, ''it will kill more people than AIDS.''
It began in 1995, when Ms. Morrison was 35 and she and Mr. Corser found a program in Italy that did sperm washing. Ms. Morrison would take drugs in New York to stimulate egg production. When she was ready, she and Mr. Corser would fly to Italy. He would produce a semen sample at a medical center in Milan, which washed the sperm. But that center did not do in vitro fertilization, which Ms. Morrison needed because her fallopian tubes were blocked. So Ms. Morrison would go to a center in Bologna for that procedure. Mr. Corser would take a train to Bologna, a two-and-a-half-hour ride, with his washed semen in a vacuum flask. ''It was unbelievable,'' Ms. Morrison said. ''We did this many, many, many times.'' Finally, she said, ''we got a horrible fax back saying that the program in Bologna is being shut down -- we can't help you.''
The group recommended neither for nor against screening men ages 65 to 75 who never smoked. Those men should consult their doctors, it said. Women, however, should not be screened, the task force said, because it is much less likely that they will have a ruptured aneurysm and, if they do, the rupture usually occurs in their 80's. Screening can be costly. It usually involves a complete ultrasound scan of the abdomen, at $350 to $400. There also are quick ultrasound tests that cost about $50 to $100. If they show an aneurysm, patients are referred for a more complete test. Medicare does not pay for preventive medicine unless Congress requires it. But vascular surgeons say the new recommendation should give Congress an impetus to make screening for the aneurysms, like screening for colon and breast cancer, part of Medicare's benefits. Lobbying for Medicare coverage has been intense, said Dr. Robert Zwolak, professor of surgery at Dartmouth Medical School. Dr. Zwolak lobbies Congress as chairman of the National Aneurysm Alliance, a group of doctors, professional societies and companies.
Over all, in 2003 and 2004, there were nearly 10 percent fewer breast cancer cases than expected. It is the first substantial drop in breast cancer incidence in more than a quarter century. And it involved women age 50 and older, not younger women, and nearly all the decline was in the common type of breast cancer, fed by estrogen, the so-called estrogen-receptor-positive tumors. The hormone connection came because the Women's Health Initiative, a large federal study examining the health effects of Prempro, the most popular drug prescribed for menopause, was halted in July 2002. The study found that women taking Prempro had an increased risk of heart disease, rather than protection from it. And the presumed benefit of taking the drug was to prevent heart disease. In addition, there was more breast cancer among women taking Prempro than those taking a placebo for comparison. Immediately, sales of Prempro, made by Wyeth, plummeted, falling by 50 percent, and they continued to fall slightly in 2004.
It turned out that the groundwater in Hinkley was polluted with trace amounts of chromium (VI), a heavy metal. The polluter was Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. In the movie, the case was clear. As Ms. Brockovich in the movie gathered medical histories from more than 600 Hinkley residents, she never seemed to doubt that every ailment was caused by chromium (VI). In the end, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric paid $333 million to settle the case. But, scientists said, the movie encouraged exactly the wrong way to think about data, elevating individuals' medical histories to the level of proof and distorting the notion of risk. Scientists, seeing the evidence that so infuriated Erin Brockovich, would be much more cautious -- and skeptical. The first question to ask is whether residents of Hinkley really did have more sickness than people living elsewhere. And, if so, what illnesses are being discussed? ''Everyone has symptoms,'' said Dr. John C. Bailar III, a professor of health studies at the University of Chicago. Half the adult population eventually gets cancer. One out of every 700 children gets cancer before age 15, he said. Vague complaints, like aches and pains and difficulty sleeping are ubiquitous. If people look for diseases, they will find them, simply because illness is so common.
Dr. Olshansky was countered by Samuel H. Preston, a professor of demography at the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Preston cited the population's overall better health, from childhood on, and said that obesity had already been factored into national projections of life spans and that the projections were that life spans would continue to increase. Dana Goldman, director and corporate chairman of health economics at the RAND Corporation, looked at the obesity question from another perspective: disability. In a recent paper in Health Affairs, Dr. Goldman and his colleagues reported that disability rates among young people had begun to increase, although they continued to decline for the elderly. He suspects it is because of obesity and says it does not augur well. He said in a telephone interview that the increased number of disabled involved less than 1 percent of young people. That means it is possible that he is seeing a spurious trend resulting from minor changes in reporting practices.
It is easy to find all these specialists, he said. ''You get recommendations at the clubhouse, at the swimming pool. You go to a restaurant here and 9 times out of 10, before the meal is over, you hear people talking about a doctor or a medicine or a surgery.'' And of course there are the other patients in all those waiting rooms. Mr. Bloomberg even recommends specialists to his own doctors. But some patients say they are frustrated by what they call a waste of resources. ''The doctors are raping Medicare,'' said Louis Ziegler, a retired manufacturer of flight simulators who lives in Delray Beach. Mr. Ziegler recalled going to a doctor for a chronic problem, a finger that sometimes freezes. All he wanted was a shot of cortisone. But he got more, much more: ''I had diathermy. I had ultrasound. I had a paraffin massage. I had $600 worth of Medicare treatments to get my lousy $35 shot of cortisone.''
Twenty-two hundred years ago, the great Greek mathematician Archimedes wrote a treatise called the Stomachion. Unlike his other writings, it soon fell into obscurity. Little of it survived, and no one knew what to make of it. But now a historian of mathematics at Stanford, sifting through ancient parchment overwritten by monks and nearly ruined by mold, appears to have solved the mystery of what the treatise was about. In the process, he has opened a surprising new window on the work of the genius best remembered (perhaps apocryphally) for his cry of ''Eureka!'' when he discovered a clever way to determine whether a king's crown was pure gold. The Stomachion, concludes the historian, Dr. Reviel Netz, was far ahead of its time: a treatise on combinatorics, a field that did not come into its own until the rise of computer science. The goal of combinatorics is to determine how many ways a given problem can be solved. And finding the number of ways that the problem posed in the Stomachion (pronounced sto-MOCK-yon) can be solved is so difficult that when Dr. Netz asked a team of four combinatorics experts to do it, it took them six weeks.
There are other promising anti-obesity molecules, Dr. Flier said, but PYY is particularly intriguing. ''This one has the compelling feature that it's been tested in animals, it's been tested in humans, it seems to work in the same concentrations in obese and lean humans, and the levels in the blood are low in obesity,'' Dr. Flier noted. Dr. Bloom said he began his study of PYY because he was saddened by the obesity he saw every day in his clinic. ''Medically, it's a disaster to be obese,'' he said, adding that the condition exacts social and emotional costs as well: ''The rate of suicide is doubled, they are unhappy, they have a lower average wage, they don't get married. They are unhappy people dying of nasty complications, and it's particularly sad because society tries to blame them.'' In the quest for treatments to counter obesity, Dr. Bloom went on, ''our research team asked the question, What is the best way to restrain appetite?'' The researchers tried filling patients up with water or with bulky, low-calorie foods like cabbage, without success. When they tried infusing nutrients directly into the bloodstream, the subjects were as hungry as ever.
But how much, and to what extent people get cowed surprised even researchers. It is hard to avoid seeing or hearing demeaning depictions of the elderly. There are greeting cards that make old people the butt of jokes. There are phrases like ''senior moment'' to describe a memory lapse. Then there are the ways older people are treated. For example, researchers find that people use ''elderspeak,'' speaking louder and using simpler words and sentences when talking to old people. Still, when Becca Levy, a psychologist at Yale University, began her work on stereotypes' effects on the elderly, she was not sure that she would find anything of note. She had examined the area with a study finding that older people in two cultures with a positive view of aging, China and the deaf Americans, fared better on memory tests than older people in the general American population. Such studies are tricky, though, because there can be hundreds of differences between cultural groups, and something else could be responsible for the memory differences. So Dr. Levy and her colleagues decided try a method that was used to study the effects of stereotypes about race and gender. The idea is to flash provocative words too quickly for people to be aware they read them.
''I'm looking right at the plaque, and when your CRP level is reduced, you are stopping the disease,'' Dr. Nissen said. ''We are saying that CRP is a direct participant in atherosclerosis.'' The next step, Dr. Ridker said, is to see if reducing CRP levels can prevent heart attacks in healthy people. His new study will enroll 15,000 people with normal cholesterol levels but higher-than-average levels of CRP, above two milligrams per liter of blood. The participants will be randomly assigned to take either 20 milligrams a day of a statin -- Crestor, made by AstraZeneca -- or a placebo. Some experts say the latest findings make it clear that doctors should monitor CRP levels in patients with severe heart disease and do whatever it takes, including giving high doses of the most powerful statins, to get levels below two milligrams per liter of blood. ''What these two papers are saying is that not only is CRP a risk factor on its own, but we should be aggressively treating it,'' said Dr. Valentin Fuster, former president of the American Heart Association and director of the cardiovascular institute at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
Others said that what amazed them was that a single gene could so profoundly affect the length of life. For nearly a century, scientists have been creating mutations in fruit flies and looking for such an effect, said Dr. Michael Rose, an evolutionary biologist and fruit fly researcher at the University of California at Irvine. It proved to be all but impossible. ''It has been very hard to find a mutation that abolishes aging,'' Dr. Rose said. ''You can find mutations that abolish vision or coordination or courtship.'' But, he said, the only ways scientists found to extend flies' lives came with terrible trade-offs:  either the flies had to starve or they could not have offspring. For example, one mutation, called grandchildless, created females with no ovaries, which made them unable to reproduce but let them live at least 50 percent longer than ordinary flies. The closest anyone has come to creating a fly that could live longer than normal and still be healthy was a fly, called methuselah, discovered a few years ago by Dr. Seymour Benzer and his colleagues at the California Institute of Technology. The methuselah flies have an average life span that is 35 percent longer than normal. But no one knows the function of the gene that was mutated to create them.
South Korean researchers are reporting today that they have cloned what scientists deem the most difficult animal, the dog. The group worked for nearly three years, seven days a week, 365 days a year and used 1,095 eggs from 122 dogs before finally succeeding with the birth of a cloned male Afghan hound. The surrogate mother was a yellow Labrador retriever. Dogs have such an unusual reproductive biology, far more so than humans, scientists say, that the methods that allowed cloning of sheep, mice, cows, goats, pigs, rabbits, cats, a mule, a horse and three rats, and creation of cloned human embryos for stem cells, simply do not work with them. Woo Suk Hwang, the principal author of the dog cloning paper, being published in the journal Nature, wrote that the puppy, an identical twin of the adult Afghan but born years later, was delivered by Caesarean section on April 24. The pregnancy lasted a normal 60 days and the newborn pup weighed 1 pound 3.4 ounces and was named Snuppy.
Usually, Dr. Geis said, he has already discussed the data in his talk, but he does so again. ''We systematically go through our data,'' he said, and he carefully explains again that the Celebrex studies found no such effect. Dr. Topol, the heart disease researcher, said his analyses of the data on Celebrex and Vioxx indicated that the drugs might be making blood more likely to clot and so might slightly increase the risk for a heart attack. All of his patients already have heart disease, he said. And, he added, ''We don't have a clue to what we should be doing in patients with heart disease.'' He tells them to take other drugs for pain if they can tolerate them. And, he said, someone -- Merck or Pharmacia or the federal government -- should conduct a study in patients with heart disease to find out conclusively if the cox-2 inhibitors increase heart disease risk.
Dr. Linda Birnbaum, director of the experimental toxicology division at the environmental agency, dismissed the arguments. ''You can spend a lot of time arguing about the numbers and the exact details,'' Dr. Birnbaum said, ''but in some ways I think it's more useful just to look at the levels. They are so much higher in farmed salmon. That gives you an indication that maybe there's something there that you don't want.'' She added, ''Personally, I eat a fair amount of fish, but I try to limit my consumption of farmed fish.'' Dr. Hahn had a different view. ''I love salmon, and I eat it a couple of times a month,'' he said. He read the Science paper carefully, he said, and ''I'm not going to change my eating habits.''
Rather, the issue comes up when scientists try to develop new stem cells, abroad or with private money. Some say this is necessary because the existing lines are insufficient and may not be safe for human use. Most of these human cells were exposed to mouse cells while being coaxed to grow in the laboratory, to prevent them from developing prematurely. This has raised the question of whether mouse cells could transmit viruses to human patients. There are no national data on the number of frozen embryos. But the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology says that most of the approximately 400 American clinics that offer in vitro fertilization also freeze embryos. The frozen embryos are one to five days old and consist of one to 120 cells. They are less than three-thousandths of an inch in diameter. Some clinics routinely ask patients if they want to donate embryos for research. Others -- the majority, fertility experts say -- do not ask.
After 20 weeks of a training program, in which the subjects worked up to exercising for 50 minutes a day, four days a week, at 85 percent of their maximum heart rates, the results were clear. ''We had large differences in respiration, in maximum oxygen uptake, in the results of muscle and adipose tissue biopsies,'' Dr. Bouchard said, referring to changes in endurance and ability to exercise at a high intensity as well as changes in body fat and in the sizes of different types of muscle fibers. ''Some did not gain in fitness,'' he added. ''Others improved by 50 percent, 60 percent. But they were all compliant.'' He did the studies again with pairs of identical twins, finding that if one twin responded well to training, so did the other; if one did not respond, neither did the other. Now, Dr. Bouchard is directing a national study, taking place at five universities, to search for the genes involved in the training effect. It includes 100 white families and 100 black families, with a total of 742 subjects.
But many medical researchers say not so fast. While rimonabant may be intriguing, these experts say, the mythology in the making is hardly justified by what is known so far. There are no published studies from clinical trials to justify any of the claims for what some patients are already calling a miracle drug. The data that the company has presented indicate that rimonabant is about as effective for weight loss in obese people as two other drugs already on the market. Nor are there any clinical tests to indicate how or whether it would work in people who are only moderately overweight, hoping to lose a few pounds after the holidays. Rimonabant has not been approved for sale in the United States or anywhere else. Sanofi-Aventis has not yet submitted its application for marketing to the Food and Drug Administration. The company says it plans to apply early next year. If the agency decides it is a high-priority application, it must issue its decision within 6 months; if not, it has 10 months to decide.
The proposed reasons are as unexpected as the changes themselves. Improved medical care is only part of the explanation; studies suggest that the effects seem to have been set in motion by events early in life, even in the womb, that show up in middle and old age. ''What happens before the age of 2 has a permanent, lasting effect on your health, and that includes aging,'' said Dr. David J. P. Barker, a professor of medicine at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland and a professor of epidemiology at the University of Southampton in England. Each event can touch off others. Less cardiovascular disease, for example, can mean less dementia in old age. The reason is that cardiovascular disease can precipitate mini-strokes, which can cause dementia. Cardiovascular disease is also a suspected risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The effects are not just in the United States. Large and careful studies from Finland, Britain, France, Sweden and the Netherlands all confirm that the same things have happened there; they are also beginning to show up in the underdeveloped world.
In the eight weeks since the fed eral government announced that it had halted a study of a popular hormone therapy used by postmenopausal women, doctors say they have been deluged by an ever-growing tide of promotional material for anything and everything that could substitute for Prempro, the drug used in the study. The alternatives run the gamut: prescription drugs that consist of slightly different hormone formulations, nutritional supplements made of herbs and vitamins, soy products said to be natural sources of estrogen, and even what might be termed menopause accessories, such as one company's ''cooling comfort towelettes'' to wipe the sweat from hot flashes. But many doctors and scientists say they are alarmed by the profusion of Prempro substitutes. The trouble, they say, is that these drugs and supplements have been studied less than Prempro has. Their benefits and risks are simply unknown. That is especially true for nutritional supplements. Their advertising receives far less government scrutiny than claims for prescription drugs, which the Food and Drug Administration regulates closely.
As reactions to the estrogen and high-fiber diet studies show, years of such careless use of language can make preliminary evidence appear to be ironclad. ''It's one of the biggest problems in this business,'' said Dr. Gilbert S. Omenn, a public health expert who is executive vice president for medical affairs at the University of Michigan. Yet even in the aftermath of the high-fiber diet studies, researchers were speaking confidently about other measures people could take to ''prevent'' colon cancer, like exercising and staying thin. And they were saying that there were reasons to keep eating fiber because it could ''reduce the risk'' of heart disease. When asked about the evidence for these statements, the researchers confessed that it was, of course, the lower level hypothesis-generating kind. Dr. Omenn came across this problem after a study he directed, and he has some advice. Dr. Omenn's large and rigorous study asked whether beta carotene, the ingredient in fruits and vegetables that many thought protected against cancer and heart disease, could, in fact, protect people. He found that not only were beta carotene supplements ineffective but they actually increased the risk of lung cancer in smokers. His findings, and those of others who found the same thing, were met with shock, denial and dismay.
The same could be said of the Bell Labs case. Dr. Beasley said that at least ''the system worked.'' Fraud was detected, the perpetrator identified. But he said that the scientific community needs to address the question of a co-author's responsibility. Should scientists essentially audit their collaborator's work? At what point would trusting relationships become adversarial? ''Obviously, you don't want prescriptive things that drive it into the mire,'' he said. ''But people need to know what in the real world are the rules of the game. And I don't think we do.''
Astonishingly, there is some evidence that even the stress of low-level radiation seems to make cells hardier, Dr. Warner said, not that he or anyone else is advocating that you subject yourself to X-rays for your health. ''I think this is not unreasonable, that the body evolved a general mechanism to respond to stress,'' Dr. Warner said. Low-calorie diets, he added, might be just one way to elicit it. And the stress-free life, Dr. Mattson added, might be the worst way to live. ''If you are a couch potato, getting no physical exercise and no mental exertion, your cells become complacent. They are not stressed so why should they do anything?'' Flex Those Nerves
There also are veiled threats at some of the medical groups. ''We have worked with a number of physicians in a confidential way,'' said Dr. Freedman, of the Tufts Health Plan. ''We say, 'You appear to have dramatically low scores. We would like to understand your justification for why and explain what actions you intend to take.' '' And, he added, ''if they don't make bona fide efforts to improve, we can go through a disciplinary process that can result in termination.'' As for future doctors, they will at least have to show they know the basics of being nice. As of 2011, all new residents will have to exhibit empathy while examining an actor posing as a patient. The residents know they are examining an actor and that the actor will be assessing their performance, Dr. Lown said. ''We are putting teeth in the need to change,'' she added.
The actual testing method ''is a real bugaboo,'' said Dr. John McKinlay, the senior vice president and chief scientist at the New England Research Institute who directs the Massachusetts Male Aging Study, which follows men and measures testosterone levels, among other things, as they age. Some methods are fraught with errors. Amory, who reviews doping cases for the United States Anti-Doping Agency, said tampering was a concern. ''When we get cases to review, the chain of custody is really paramount,'' he said. ''If it gets out of sight for two seconds, someone can squirt testosterone into it. And there are people like that who would like to see an American, the winner of the Tour de France, disgraced. That's why the chain of custody has to be codified.'' And that is why the urine samples are divided in two, the A sample and the B sample. For now, Amory said, it was too soon to convict Landis in the court of public opinion.
They looked for a disordered growth pattern in the tumor tissue. They examined the individual cells, looking for irregular shapes and enlarged nuclei. In just 11 of the 37 tumors did all the experts come to the same conclusion about what they were seeing. The Skewed Screenings  'Overdiagnosis': A Growing Problem Neuroblastoma is the sole cancer in which such clear evidence exists that a screening test did harm without doing good. But some experts say there is reason to believe that other cancer screening tests produce similar effects, but perhaps not as pronounced. Those experts call the problem overdiagnosis, or finding tumors that are not dangerous but that cannot be distinguished from ones that may become lethal. Those experts see signs of overdiagnosis in prostate cancer, where men 50 and older are urged to have a blood test known as the P.S.A. (or prostate specific antigen); in melanoma screening, which looks for the malignant skin cancer; and in lung cancer screening, with a new test, the spiral C.T.
At a recent meeting of a Las Vegas chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, eight burly men crowded into a library meeting room. All had experienced the equivalent of the Civil War tent problem. ''At the re-enactments, all the directors, all the costume directors say the re-enactors are just too darn big,'' said George McClendon, a hefty 67-year-old retired airline pilot. Mr. McClendon is right. Men living in the Civil War era had an average height of 5-foot-7 and weighed an average of 147 pounds. That translates into a body mass index of 23, well within the range deemed ''normal.'' Today, men average 5-foot-9 1/2 and weigh an average of 191 pounds, giving them an average body mass index of 28.2, overweight and edging toward obesity. Those changes, along with the great improvements in general health and life expectancy in recent years, intrigued Dr. Costa. Common chronic diseases -- respiratory problems, valvular heart disease, arteriosclerosis, and joint and back problems -- have been declining by about 0.7 percent a year since the turn of the 20th century. And when they do occur, they emerge at older ages and are less severe.
But to their own amazement, scientists are now finding that untangling the genetics of cancer is not impossible. In fact, they say, what looked like an impenetrable shield protecting cancer cells turns out to be flimsy. And those seemingly impervious cancer cells, Dr. Golub said, ''are very much poised to die.'' The story of genes and cancer, like most in science, involves many discoveries over many years. But in a sense, it has its roots in the 1980's, with a bold decision by Dr. Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University to piece together the molecular pathways that lead to cancer. It was a time when the problem looked utterly complicated. Scientists thought that cancer cells were so abnormal that they were, as Dr. Vogelstein put it, ''a total black box.'' But Dr. Vogelstein had an idea: what if he started with colon cancer, which had some unusual features that made it more approachable?
In a way, it is irresistible, this fixation on genetic predestination -- especially when evidence can be seen in the mirror. But as my father's view of his family's longevity demonstrated, it can be deceptive. Remember the Jim twins? They were the subjects studied a decade ago by Thomas Bouchard of the University of Minnesota. Identical twins reared apart, they both just happened to be named James -- James Lewis and James Springer. Each just happened to marry and divorce women named Linda, then remarry women named Betty. The Jim twins named their dogs Toy and their firstborn sons James Alan and James. Could genes really be so controlling? Not exactly, say statisticians. It is a classical example of the multiple-end-point problem, something that undoubtedly is prompting all of us to give more weight to genetics than is warranted. The difficulty is that there are hundreds of thousands of traits that any two people can share, and if you look at any two people plucked randomly, you are sure to find that they have one or two traits in common, independent of genetics. If both Jim twins had not been named Jim, they both might have worn wire-rimmed glasses or lived on streets named Elm Road, for example.
Scientists have discovered that monkey cells have innate protection against infection with the human AIDS virus, a clue that may help explain why some people are susceptible to certain viral infections while others are not. The finding, reported in today's issue of the journal Nature, offers one of the first concrete examples of what researchers call an intracellular system of innate immunity and may open the door to the development of new antiviral therapies, the scientists said. The monkeys were protected from the virus by a mechanism that resides within cells and that is independent of the antibodies and white blood cells of the immune system. The mechanism appears to have evolved to protect animals from specific viruses. In the case of AIDS, the researchers found, the monkeys blocked the human immunodeficiency virus, or H.I.V., as soon as it slipped into cells, using a protein that prevented the virus from shedding the hard casing around its genes. The protein, called TRIM5-alpha, apparently floats inside the monkey cells, looking for H.I.V.
''I knew science was a great topic, with its rituals and hierarchies and moral ambiguities and dysfunctions,'' Ms. Goodman said. She added: ''People write about kings and queens and the important part of society. To me, the scientists, that's the nobility. The questions they work on are so fundamental.'' Ms. Goodman, a 38-year-old car-pooling mother of three grade school boys and a 3-year-old girl, is not a complete stranger to science. Her husband, David Karger, is a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Her sister, Dr. Paula Fraenkel, studies zebrafish at Harvard Medical School. Her mother, Madeleine Goodman, was an epidemiologist at the University of Hawaii. Some of her friends are scientists, and she has seen their struggles and triumphs, but at a distance. Ms. Goodman was always the literary one in her family. At 15, she was obsessed with John Donne. She received a Ph.D. from Stanford in English literature in 1997.
But while the study, in Sweden, was large, with 695 men ages 60 to 70, and done according to the strictest scientific design, its patients were not exactly like the typical prostate cancer patient in the United States today. The Swedish men generally discovered that they had prostate cancer because the tumors had grown large enough to cause symptoms, like difficulty urinating. In the United States, most men find out they have prostate cancer when they have a screening test, the P.S.A., or prostate specific antigen, that looks for a protein in the blood that can be indicative of a cancer too small to feel. It is not certain whether surgery for cancers that small would be better, or worse, than it was for the larger tumors. But the study, published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, resolved a thorny issue. Until now, some doctors had argued that the popular cancer surgery might not stop the disease from spreading. It was possible, they argued, that aggressive cancers that could kill had already spread beyond the prostate by the time they were detected, making the operation futile, while the less aggressive ones would never spread in a man's lifetime, making the operation unnecessary.
He went home and lay on his bed. ''I knew at that point that it was not a pulled muscle,'' Mr. Orr said. ''It's a completely different feeling of pressure and discomfort. You feel as though something is genuinely wrong.'' It was 3:15. And the pain was no longer intermittent. It was constant. Mr. Orr called Mr. Friedman and asked him to drive him to an emergency room. A few minutes later, the two set off for Brigham and Women's Hospital, about a 10-minute drive. ''Keith was hunched over and he didn't put his seat belt on,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''I kept asking him, 'Is it getting better or getting worse or staying the same?' For the first 10 minutes he said, 'It's about the same.' Then, when we were a block or so away, he said: 'I'm not doing well. I think it's getting worse.' '' When they arrived at the hospital's emergency department, Mr. Friedman explained that his friend was having chest pains. Immediately, Mr. Orr was wheeled off for an electrocardiogram, showing his heart's electrical signals. It was ominous, including one pattern called the tombstone T wave because patients who had it died in the days before there were aggressive treatments to open arteries.
In a hotel meeting room, in Gaithersburg, Md., an expert advisory committee will weigh the company's data and hear the pleadings of implant supporters and critics. Then it will decide whether the company has made its case, that silicone breast implants are safe enough to return to the market after a 10-year hiatus. It would be highly unusual for the agency to allow the implants, a leading drug law expert said. The expert, Peter Barton Hutt, a Washington lawyer who was chief counsel at the drug agency from 1971 to 1975, said products that were removed from the market for safety reasons almost never came back. ''Most are just abandoned, and for good reason,'' Mr. Hutt said. ''Once the F.D.A. takes a position that something is unsafe, it is virtually impossible to get them to reverse it.'' Arguments about implant safety, and even whether women should be enlarging their breasts in the first place, have been heated, emotional and wrenching. Lawsuits sent one implant maker, Dow Corning, into bankruptcy and forced it and other companies to set up a multibillion-dollar fund to compensate women who the implant makers had argued were never sickened by the devices in the first place.
After months of deliberations and negotiations with academic and commercial laboratories, Mr. Golden said, the hospital decided to charge a royalty fee of $12.50 per test. The money, he said, would partly offset the hospital's own costs in paying for Dr. Matalon's research, and the amount would not be overly burdensome to people paying for the test. The hospital hopes to use some of the royalty money to publicize the test, he added. But the families who got the research going are not assuaged. They want the gene test in the public domain, available to laboratories free of charge and free of the encumbrance of licensing agreements. ''We gave our samples to be used for the public good,'' said Judith Tsipis, a parent of a boy with Canavan disease and the director of the genetic counseling program at Brandeis University. ''They were not given to Miami Children's,'' she said. ''Had they told us they wanted to patent it, we probably would have found another researcher who had the same goals as we did. Finding the gene is not an impossible task.''
But as the lung scans are being  promoted, one gap in the logic remains. Dr. Henschke's study had shown that spiral CT scanners could find tiny lung cancers. What it did not show was whether finding them saved lives. And that is fueling the bitter debate over how much evidence of that is necessary. ''It's the fundamental question,'' said Dr. David F. Yankelevitz, Dr. Henschke's colleague at Cornell. ''These are critical issues, and it's a discussion that needs to happen.'' A Questionable Study Dr. Henschke cannot convince herself that there is much more to ask. She knows the hypothetical problems with early detection, but she does not believe they apply to lung cancer. ''Logically, we know you can cure cancer only when you get it at an early stage,'' Dr. Henschke said. ''CT gets it much much earlier. The only thing that has to be documented is how many lives are saved.''
''There is no guarantee that your vote goes into the computer the way it looked on the touch screen,'' Dr. Neumann said. One thing is sure: with touch-screen computers, there is no chance for a recount. Last week, after jamming supermarkets and lining up at gas stations to fill their tanks in preparation for a monster snowstorm that essentially missed them, New Yorkers were amused, disappointed, and, in some cases, angry. Can't the weather forecasters get it right? No, said Bob Gall, the lead scientist for the United States Weather Research Program. ''The error we're seeing in the forecast of something like the storm on the East Coast is probably close to the limit of technology today,'' he said. It is impossible, because of measurement errors, to perfectly specify atmospheric conditions at any one time, he said. And once the conditions are plugged into a computer program, any tiny error gets compounded. The bulk of a storm can -- did -- end up in Connecticut, not Manhattan.
Yet few want to give up and accept the idea that this is a nation of obese people. In a campaign that resembles the antismoking crusades of an earlier era, the Washington Business Group on Health, an organization of 175 large employers that provides benefits for 40 million people, is starting an initiative to help its members lose weight Worried about the effects of obesity on health care costs and productivity, the umbrella organization is starting a new initiative, helping its member companies encourage their workers to lose weight. ''We are all stunned as we listen to the statistics,'' said Helen Darling, the group's president. She pointed to studies concluding that obesity is now as much of a health problem as tobacco used to be, and as much of a drain on the economy. Today, 35 percent of Americans are overweight, and 27 percent are obese. (Overweight -- a body mass index of 25 to 29 -- translates into a weight of 150 to 174 pounds for a 5-foot-5 woman, for example, and 182 to 213 pounds for a 6-foot man. Obesity, a body mass index above 30, would mean weights above those levels.) The incidence of diabetes increased by 50 percent in the past 10 years. And half of all obese people are either diabetics or incipient diabetics.
In both cases, the investigators found, patients at community hospitals fared at least as well as those at academic medical centers. With pneumonia, for example, patients are supposed to receive antibiotics within four hours of being admitted to the hospital. ''If you go to a community hospital, you had a 72 percent chance of getting your antibiotics within four hours of hitting the door,'' Dr. Lindenauer said. ''If you go to the large teaching hospital, you have a 56 percent chance.'' ''Our study wasn't able to answer why,'' Dr. Lindenauer added, but he said he has a hunch. ''A routine case of pneumonia may not command all of the resources and personnel of the emergency room in the way it might in a community hospital.'' The study of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease came to the same conclusion: The hospitals that took care of more of these patients really did no better than the hospitals that took care of fewer, he said.
''I think of this as the 'storm clouds on the horizon' phenomenon,'' Dr. Goldman said. Others remain circumspect. Perhaps obesity will lead to increased disability, some say. While disability is declining over all, said Dr. Richard M. Suzman, director of the office of behavioral and social research programs at the National Institute on Aging, ''if you hadn't had the increase in obesity, would disability have gone down much faster?'' The problem for now, Dr. Williamson says, is that there is so much concern over obesity that other factors may be ignored. He tells of a recent episode that illustrates his point, when he went with some Italian colleagues to see a photography exhibit. ''We were looking at pictures of Pennsylvania coal miners in the late 1800's and early 1900's,'' Dr. Williamson said. ''A lot of these people were kids.'' ''The Italians said to me, 'Oh, look. These kids were so thin.' ''
And it might be expected that after a certain point, more years of school would not add to a person's life span. That, however, is not what the data shows. The education effect never wanes. But most researchers say they are swayed by Dr. Lleras-Muney's work and the studies in other countries. That, though, leaves the question of why the education effect occurs. Dr. Lleras-Muney and others point to one plausible explanation -- as a group, less educated people are less able to plan for the future and to delay gratification. If true, that may, for example, explain the differences in smoking rates between more educated people and less educated ones. Smokers are at least twice as likely to die at any age as people who never smoked, says Samuel Preston, a demographer at the University of Pennsylvania. And not only are poorly educated people more likely to smoke but, he says, ''everybody knows that smoking can be deadly,'' and that includes the poorly educated.
Carmen Franco, who owns six clinics in Detroit, said she expects to charge women $450 for a mifepristone abortion with the full three-pill dose. It is less than her costs. But, she said, by making it available, she expects to draw patients to the clinic where they can see the full range of options she provides. ''We probably will use it as a loss leader,'' she said. A Subsidized Competitor Dr. Hern used to have plenty of patients for first-trimester abortions at his clinic in Boulder, where he was charging $375. Then, a Planned Parenthood clinic opened in nearby Fort Collins, charging less than $300. Subsidized by the nonprofit Planned Parenthood Foundation, the clinic was able to keep its fees lower than Dr. Hern could even contemplate. ''Within a month after that clinic opened, my patient numbers dropped by 25 percent,'' Dr. Hern said. Independent abortion providers say Planned Parenthood clinics can easily undercut them.
The papers are accompanied by two editorials that call into question the widespread public assumption that the mammography debate has been settled. It is a debate mostly taking place among researchers and some advocacy groups. Guidelines from major medical organizations are in accord that women should have regular mammograms starting in their 40's. Dr. Steven Goodman, a biostatistician at the Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center who wrote one of the editorials, said in an interview last week that the arguments among researchers continued because the data were so inconclusive. ''If we are still unsure after looking at something like half a million women, that points to how small the risks are and how much smaller the benefit is in absolute numbers,'' Dr. Goodman said. ''There is statistical uncertainty around the estimates of benefits and harm, but perhaps the biggest unknown is how much harm women will find acceptable for an uncertain benefit,'' he added.
An estimated 10 million American women take Premarin, an estrogen that was approved only to alleviate the symptoms of menopause, like hot flashes, and for the prevention and management of osteoporosis. The drug's maker, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, a subsidiary of the American Home Products Corporation, says  the estrogen is the best-selling prescription drug in America. Doctors and individual women say that one reason for estrogen's popularity is that there is a widespread belief that it will prevent heart disease. But that hypothesis came from indirect evidence. Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said in a statement on Monday that the new information is ''preliminary.'' It does not address the larger issue of long-term benefits and risks of hormone replacement therapy, he said, ''and, therefore, it should not influence current medical practice.'' Previous studies have shown that women who take estrogen after menopause have fewer heart attacks than women who do not. But since women who take the hormone tend to be better educated, less likely to smoke and more likely to eat balanced diets and exercise, it was hard for researchers to tell whether the therapy or other factors in their lives contributed to their lower risk. The only way to know for sure was to do a large study like the current one.
''The implant industry has taken away my health,'' Ms. Dowd said. Then there was Mary Ann Ward of Cocoa Beach, Fla., who said she had implants 24 years ago, at age 28, to improve her appearance. ''I've been thrilled with the look and the feel of my breasts,'' Ms. Ward said. ''You've heard many compelling stories today, many of them sad. My story is no less compelling because it is a happy one.''
Editors' Note:  December 4, 2002, Wednesday  A front-page article on Monday described the use of steroids by men and women seeking larger, more chiseled bodies. The article traced the spread of the drugs from the world of weight lifting and bodybuilding to the general society. In discussing the history of steroid use in athletic competition, the article cited a comment by Frank Shorter, a former Olympic marathon champion, who said that before a meet in France in 1969 he saw the hammer thrower George Frenn inject a steroid into his leg. Mr. Shorter is now chairman of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, which performs drug tests for Olympic-related sports. The article said Mr. Frenn was a Frenchman, and Mr. Shorter said he died at an early age. On Monday, a freelance track journalist alerted The Times that Mr. Frenn was alive and was a native of the United States. Telephoned at home in Sacramento, Mr. Frenn said, ''Frank Shorter never ever saw me inject myself.'' He declined to answer further questions. In an interview later that day, he added, ''How dare Frank Shorter say something like that.''
But when Ms. Buchanan received a diagnosis of breast cancer a few years ago, she stayed with the local doctor who found her tumor, Dr. Rachel P. Dultz, at University Medical Center, a community hospital in Princeton, N.J. She just had a good, warm feeling about Dr. Dultz, she said, and could not imagine that she would receive better care from anyone else. ''If I went to a Sloan-Kettering, I'm sure there are fabulous people there, but you've got to have total confidence in the person who's going to be taking care of you,'' Ms. Buchanan said. Patsy Brandt of Cherry Hill, N.J., came to the opposite conclusion. She went to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia, and never investigated any other options for her breast cancer treatment. ''It's sort of a no-brainer when one lives in a doable radius of a major teaching and research hospital,'' Mrs. Brandt said.
''The a priori hypothesis would be that antioxidants are protective, but there hasn't been any evidence of protection and there has been a hint of harm,'' he said. But the evidence of harm was weak, so he and his colleagues decided to pool data from 19 studies to get more definitive answers. Their paper, however, failed to convince some statisticians, who noted that it is notoriously difficult to pool data from disparate studies with different populations and weak results. ''They may well be right, but as a statistician I find this paper unpersuasive,'' said Dr. David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California at Berkeley. But since there also is no evidence that the vitamin can help, he added, ''I personally wouldn't recommend that you take large doses.'' Dr. James Robins, a Harvard statistician, had a similar reaction. ''They may be right but they somewhat oversold it statistically,'' Dr. Robins said. ''It is definitely true that there is no evidence that the low dose does anything for you, and a high dose may be bad. I wouldn't tell anyone to take this stuff, but this is hardly definitive evidence.''
EVERYONE has heard of urban legends, stories -- like alligators in the sewers or LSD on stickers handed out to schoolchildren -- that spread around the country, repeated so often that people swear they are true. Skeptics who try to track such tales to their sources find that the grapevine that transmitted them trails off into mist. It is a phenomenon that seems totally alien to the world of science. In all its branches, science is proudly defensive of its rigorous, disciplined empiricism, methodically excising unproven beliefs from its discourse and brushing off pseudosciences that try to attach themselves to its validating coattails. But two Danish researchers offered science a humbling lesson last week, saying in a paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine that the placebo effect does not exist. Now the placebo effect -- which is supposed to account for the fact that about a third of patients get better when given a dummy pill or a sham treatment -- has been cited in textbooks and journal articles for decades. It is part of the medical mainstream and the popular culture. So established is the placebo effect that some scientists focus their careers on exploring how it works, looking for changes in the immune system or in hormones that allow the mind to affect the body.
So in 1994, when Mr. Massey arrived at Massachusetts General Hospital, he had been infected with H.I.V. for 16 years. Now 46, he has been infected for more than half his life. Soon, Mr. Massey was meeting with Dr. Bruce Walker, an infectious disease specialist there who was interested in people who were beating the odds. In an H.I.V. infection, Dr. Walker said, the virus attacks the very immune system cells it needs to guide the body's defenses. He describes these cells, a subset of the helper T-cells, as generals directing the troops, which are the killer T-cells of the immune system, to seek out and destroy the virus. When H.I.V. kills the helper cells, Dr. Walker said, ''it is as though you have this infantry but no generals telling them what to do.'' So the first question Dr. Walker asked was, Did Mr. Massey have this subset of helper T-cells, the CD4 cells, that could coordinate an attack on H.I.V.?
They were not. The students could, however, recite chapter and verse on the importance of activity and proper nutrition. They also ate less fat, going from 34 percent to 27 percent fat in their total diet. Alas, said the study's principal investigator, Benjamin Caballero, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, ''it was not enough to change body weight.'' The paper appeared in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2003 to no acclaim, Dr. Caballero said. No press release, no media coverage, no invitations to speak about the results at scientific meetings. On the journal's Web page, a search of articles that refer to the study comes up empty. It has not been cited anywhere. The second study, of 5,106 children in 96 schools in California, Louisiana, Minnesota and Texas, had a similar design and the same results: all that help made no difference in the children's weights.
Sex hormones may also play a role, Dr. Blackman said. ''Sex steroids stimulate the growth hormone system,'' he said. ''At least in younger people, when one is awry, the other one goes down.'' In their study, the researchers tried to recreate in older people the hormone levels of a 20-  or 30-year-old. They recruited 57 women and 74 men, with ages from 65 to 88, giving them hormones or dummy medications. The most striking results were in the men who took both growth hormone and testosterone. They gained almost 10 pounds of lean body mass and lost a corresponding amount of fat. They also increased their cardiovascular endurance, a measure of their ability to exercise. Men who took growth hormone alone gained seven pounds of lean body mass and lost a similar amount of fat but their endurance did not change. The women who took growth hormone, with or without estrogen and progesterone, gained a few pounds of lean body mass and lost five pounds of fat. In both men and women, sex hormones alone did not significantly change their body composition. Growth hormone appeared to be the major factor.
''People don't like to hear this stuff,'' said Dr. Leslie Laufman, an oncologist at Hematology Oncology Consultants of Columbus, Ohio. ''People cling to mammograms. They cling to the idea that there is something they can do to protect themselves. If we take away that as a security blanket, people turn to you and say, 'So what am I supposed to do?' '' The mammogram story shows both the uncertainty of scientific progress and the slipperiness of scientific truth. ''There is a great ignorance of the scientific process,'' said Dr. Leon Gordis, a public health expert at Johns Hopkins University. All too often, science progresses in fits and starts, reexamining data, reinterpreting evidence -- a path that can be hard to accept in medicine, when answers are needed now. It happened recently with hormone replacement therapy for women after menopause. First it seemed that all women could benefit. Then scientists cautioned that estrogen might spur breast cancer. But, they said, it protects the heart, and more women die of heart disease than breast cancer. Now, it looks as if estrogen pills do not protect the heart. Estrogen does slow bone loss, and so it may help prevent fractures from osteoporosis. And it alleviates hot flashes. Who should take it? Experts disagree.
''These are decisions that are going to have to be discussed between people and their health care providers,'' Dr. Lichtenfeld said. Dr. Parnes worries that men with low P.S.A. levels and their doctors will see the study results and decide unequivocally that the safest thing to do is have a biopsy. In that case, since about 90 percent of men have levels that are below 4, huge numbers would have biopsies, huge numbers would be told they have cancer, and huge numbers might opt for treatment that is perhaps unnecessary. Prostate cancer is exceedingly common; autopsy studies in which prostates are examined section by section find microscopic cancerous cells in most elderly men. But it tends to smolder silently, never spreading or causing problems in a man's lifetime. Still, it can be deadly. Prostate cancer kills 30,000 American men a year. As yet, there is no way to know for sure whether a cancer will spread and kill, so most men choose treatment although it can lead to impotence or incontinence.
In a way, this story begins in the late 1970's, in the office of Dr. William R. Waddell at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. One of Dr. Waddell's patients had a rare inherited condition known as familial adenomatous polyposis, or F.A.P.. People with F.A.P. eventually develop hundreds or thousands of polyps in their colons -- too many to excise one by one. Since colon cancers start out as polyps, the only way to protect these patients is to remove their colons. Dr. Waddell had removed the woman's colon when she was 23 but by August 1978, at the age of 31, she had developed another common consequence of F.A.P.: noncancerous  scarlike tumors in her abdomen. In addition, polyps were starting to grow in her rectum and Dr. Waddell expected that they would proliferate until she would have to have her rectum removed as well. For the time being, however, Dr. Waddell had to treat the tumors in her abdomen.
Other critics said that the study made a mistake in even aiming for 20 percent of calories as fat. Dietary fat should be even lower, they said, as low as 10 percent. But Dr. Rossouw said this was unrealistic, because try as they might, people are not able to change their eating habits that much. ''You can't do that,'' he said. ''Forget it. It's impossible.'' Critics now are telling the investigators that the study was useless because it focused on total fat in the diet, rather than on saturated fat, which raises cholesterol levels. If the women had focused instead on getting rid of fats like butter, had substituted fats like olive oil and had eaten more fruits and grains, then the study might have shown that the proper diet reduces heart disease risk, they claim. ''Lifestyle goes beyond a modest difference in saturated fat,'' said Dr. Robert H. Eckel, president of the American Heart Association.
The report said that for groundwater, the cost of going from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's limits of 25 millirem a year to the level that the Environmental Protection Agency wants could be billions of dollars. Scientists usually rely on a mathematical model in estimating radiation risk. The most widely used model is known as the linear-nonthreshold dose-response model. It assumes that there is no safe dose of radiation and that the risk of getting cancer or genetic damage increases along with radiation exposure. ''For better or worse, that is our model,'' said Stephen Page, the director of the environmental agency's office of radiation and indoor air. And with that model, he said, ''the E.P.A. has tried to be as protective as possible.'' The agency, he added, uses that model to make sure the risk from radiation is within the allowable range from toxic chemicals, 1 in 10,000 to 1 in a million chance of developing cancer.
The review of the trial data on abdominal aortic aneurysms, along with the task force's recommendations, is being published today in the Annals of Internal Medicine. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a small weakened area of the aorta, the large artery that carries blood from the heart and winds down along the spinal cord to the abdomen. Over the years, the weak spot slowly balloons and eventually bursts. There are no symptoms as the aneurysm grows, but once it reaches five and a half centimeters, or a little over two inches, in diameter, it may burst at any moment. That is the time to repair it, medical researchers say, explaining that smaller aneurysms posed too little danger to be worth the risk of operating on them. Of course, finding small aneurysms also leads to a screening dilemma: patients will discover that they have a time bomb in their body but will have to wait and monitor it before getting it fixed. Still, vascular surgeons say, that is far better than the current situation, in which most aneurysms are found by accident, or when they rupture.
''I thought the pedals were going to fall off the bike,'' he said. ''It was the weirdest feeling. It turned out that it wasn't the pedals. It was the chain wheel flexing back and forth.'' My custom bicycle is not the lightest possible -- it is made of steel. But it was nothing like the ready-made bicycle I had been riding. It was completed on a steamy Friday last July, ready for pickup at a local bicycle shop that had done the paperwork, measured me, and added its components, like a seat and a chain wheel. I left work early to get it. The dimpled young man at the shop was crestfallen when I grabbed the bicycle and dashed out. He wanted me to ride it around the parking lot. ''Why?'' I asked. ''I wanted to see the expression on your face,'' he explained. I scoffed. After all, this was just a bicycle, I thought. The difference is it will fit me. The pain in the back of my neck will no longer plague me and I will do better on hills.
''If you go out six hours, it can be pretty accurate,'' Dr. Gall said of weather projections. ''Two days can be problematic. At 10 days, you can get almost anything.'' ONE historian, Edward Tenner, now a visiting researcher at Princeton,  who keeps a file on counting problems, says the census and the voting quandaries are typical of what always occurs when people try to change a way of formulating a number. The trick, he said, is either to learn to live with known inaccuracies or to be sure that any new number is really an improvement. The issue reminds him of the unopened packs of cigarettes bartered in Europe after World War II. ''Everyone knew they were probably stale, but as long as no one opened them, you couldn't be sure,'' he said. ''A lot of numbers are like that. As long as you accept them at face value, they work. They are based on a common suspension of inspection.'' But, he said, the moment that stance is abandoned, ''you have a very hard time agreeing again on another standard.''
The data indicate that if 10,000 women take the drugs for a year, 8 more will develop invasive breast cancer, compared with 10,000 who were not taking hormone replacement therapy. An additional 7 will have a heart attack, 8 will have a stroke, and 18 will have blood clots. But there will be 6 fewer colorectal cancers and 5 fewer hip fractures. The study was to continue until 2005, said Dr. Jacques E. Rossouw, who is its acting director. For the first few years that the women took the drugs, they were at no increased risk of cancer, heart disease or blood clots, and the study did not address the benefits of using the drugs for a short period to relieve the symptoms of menopause. The decision to end the study came on May 31, in a periodic look at its accumulating data by an expert panel, the data safety and monitoring board. Suddenly, Dr. Rossouw said, after women had taken the drugs for an average of 5.2 years, the data had crossed a line. ''The breast cancer risk exceeded the predefined boundary for safety,'' he said.
Health of Nations
''Now here we are a few decades later saying that patients at high risk should take their L.D.L. levels to 70 or less,'' Dr. Nissen said. He and others, like Dr. Valentin Fuster, director of the Cardiovascular Institute at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, predict that the optimal levels for L.D.L. cholesterol will go lower still. Clinical trials under way are expected to provide even stronger evidence of the value of intense cholesterol lowering, Dr. Fuster and others said. Dr. Fuster added that in the future even L.D.L. levels of 70 would seem too high for those at greatest risk. ''I can predict that the guidelines will be modified to be more and more aggressive, and it will happen in the next three years, if not earlier,'' he said.
AS surely as middle age brings on a receding hairline and, all too often, a growing waistline, it also brings, for most men, an embarrassing problem. Its medical name is B.P.H., for benign prostatic hypertrophy, or hyperplasia and, as its name implies, it is an enlargement of the prostate that is not caused by cancer. It shows up as a problem with urinating. ''Most men, by the time they get into their 50's and 60's, have a decrease in urinary function,'' said Dr. Albert G. Mulley Jr., a specialist in internal medicine and medical decision making at the Massachusetts General Hospital. ''A lot of men won't talk about it, but the stream isn't what it used to be. It becomes awfully hard to empty your bladder and not to feel like you have to empty it again. There's lots of dribbling.'' What can men do about it? About a decade ago, the choices were bleak. ''Men lived with their symptoms, and if they got really bad, they had surgery,'' said Dr. Peter C. Albertsen, a urologist at the University of Connecticut Health Center.
While Dr. Prine's scheme may seem reminiscent of the contortions doctors went through decades ago before abortions were legal, what makes her unusual is not so much her plan as the fact that she will offer mifepristone at all. Although the abortion pill's distributor, Danco Laboratories, says it will begin shipping the drug later this month, many private doctors say they still have no plans to offer it to their patients. That would leave it to abortion clinics to provide the pill. But many doctors at abortion clinics say they will advise their patients to choose a surgical abortion instead because they think surgery is a better method. Their decision to offer mifepristone, some say, is dictated more by competitive reasons than by their conviction that it is the best way to end a pregnancy. Doctors say they know that the situation is paradoxical. For abortion rights supporters who have waited for years for mifepristone, the drug's great promise was that it could take early abortions out of clinics, where women can be harassed and doctors threatened, and bring them to private doctors' offices. There, no one but a woman and her doctor would know that she had decided to terminate her pregnancy.
The results showed that death rates from the disease could be cut by nearly 25 percent, a result so decisive that the study ended last March, nine months ahead of schedule. One of the principal investigators, Dr. Roy G. Brower of Johns Hopkins University, announced the findings at a medical meeting in April and began preparing a paper for publication. That paper was accepted about two weeks ago by The New England Journal of Medicine, and an edited version was completed this week, Dr. Brower said. The journal deemed the results so important that it released the paper yesterday, posting it on its Web site (www.nejm.org). The paper will appear in the issue dated May 4. One treatment strategy was to push large volumes of air into patients' lungs, at high pressure. The advantage was that sufficient oxygen got into patients' blood. But the concern was that the pressures would damage the lung tissue, slowing healing or making it impossible.
When Dr. Satcher took office in February 1998, he said his priorities were giving a healthy start to all children; persuading Americans to eat healthy diets, exercise and shun tobacco; eliminating racial disparities in disease; and giving mental health the same priority as physical health. He also said, ''I want to be known as the surgeon general who listened better than any other surgeon general before.'' In 1999, Dr. Satcher released the first surgeon general's report on mental health, concluding that one in five Americans suffered from some form of mental illness and that the main obstacle that these people faced in receiving medical care was that mental illness carried a stigma. That year, he also issued ''The Surgeon General's Call to Action in Preventing Suicide.'' Dr. Satcher said the mental health and suicide reports grew out of his policy of listening -- reading letters he received, paying attention when he spoke to the public. And the response has been gratifying.
Doctors said that virtual colonoscopy appeals to some who shun other screening methods. Many people abhor the idea of sedation, used in traditional colonoscopy. Others worry about the risks -- most notably a chance of one in several thousand that the colon will be perforated. That requires major emergency abdominal surgery. In the new study, about 54 percent of patients said regular colonoscopy was more uncomfortable than virtual, about 38 percent said virtual was more uncomfortable and about 8 percent were undecided. But almost 70 percent of the patients said virtual colonoscopy was more convenient. ''Some of the appeal of virtual colonoscopy is its name,'' said Dr. Douglas K. Rex, a professor of medicine at Indiana University and president of the American College of Gastroenterology. He added that many experts call it ''C.T. colonography'' instead. ''Some of the appeal goes away when you call it that name,'' he said. For all its promise, medical experts say, there are problems to be worked out with virtual colonoscopy. One is when to refer such patients for regular colonoscopy. In general, the larger the polyp, the more worrisome it is. But do you use 10 millimeters in diameter as a cutoff point? If so, then 3 to 5 percent of patients will need a regular colonoscopy to cut out the polyps found on a virtual one. Do you choose six to nine millimeters? Then at least 30 percent will need traditional colonoscopy.
Two other rulings by lower courts rebuked the agency on similar grounds. In 1998, the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia overturned F.D.A. regulations preventing companies from freely distributing information about unapproved uses for approved drugs and devices. (The agency's challengers were represented by Mr. Troy, a constitutional lawyer who was in private practice before coming to the F.D.A. in 2001.) The court said it was not enough for the agency to argue that it was protecting the public. ''To the extent that the F.D.A. is endeavoring to keep information from physicians out of concern that they will misuse that information,'' the federal court said, ''the regulation is wholly and completely unsupportable.'' The decision was vacated on appeal. Another ruling, in 1999, involved the F.D.A.'s refusal to allow dietary supplement makers to put four health claims on their labels. The agency said the claims failed its test of ''significant scientific agreement.'' But the United State Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the First Amendment requires a ''preference for disclosure over outright suppression.''
Dr. Paul E. Greene, a neurologist at the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons and a researcher in the study, said the uncontrollable movements some patients suffered were ''absolutely devastating.'' ''They chew constantly, their fingers go up and down, their wrists flex and distend,'' Dr. Greene said. And the patients writhe and twist, jerk their heads, fling their arms about. ''It was tragic, catastrophic,'' he said. ''It's a real nightmare. And we can't selectively turn it off.'' One man was so badly affected that he could no longer eat and had to use a feeding tube, Dr. Greene said. In another, the condition came and went unpredictably throughout the day, and when it occurred, the man's speech was unintelligible. For now, Dr. Greene said, his position is clear: 'No more fetal transplants. We are absolutely and adamantly convinced that this should be considered for research only. And whether it should be research in people is an open question.''
In the case of a diabetic, scientists would prod the stem cells with an as-yet-undefined cocktail of chemicals so they would grow into islet cells of the pancreas. That could replace those lost to the disease. Voil√†, a cure. But no one has yet made a cloned human embryo. In two reported attempts, one by scientists at Advanced Cell Technology and the other by scientists in China, the efforts utterly failed. The eggs died almost immediately and no cloned embryos were produced. ''It's just a big failure,'' said Dr. Richard Schultz, a developmental and reproductive biologist at the University of Pennsylvania. As it turns out, cloning is not even the first hurdle. Scientists often find it impossible even to extract and grow stem cells from a normal human blastocyst. ''Forget cloning, just to get human stem cells is not trivial,'' Dr. Schultz said. ''They are difficult to generate and difficult to maintain.''
Renee Chelian, the director of Northland Family Planning, a Detroit abortion clinic, said no private doctors in her area offered the pill either, as far as she knew. ''It's too much trouble,'' she said, and it is easy for women to get Mifeprex from the many abortion clinics in Detroit. ''There are so many clinics that it's, Why bother?'' Ms. Chelian said. Ms. Chelian said she had provided Mifeprex to about 75 women, which is less than 1 percent of the women having abortions at her clinic. They tend to be women who had bad experiences in the past with surgical abortions, Ms. Chelian said. Those women, however, report that they preferred the medical abortions. ''I frankly have been very surprised,'' Ms. Chelian said. Dr. Prine said she advertised that she offered the pill and that many who received it from her were not her patients -- they sought her out. So far, she said, she has provided medical abortions to 240 women, but added that many women still were unaware that they had any choice other than surgery to end a pregnancy.
And so, increasingly, scientists, like Dr. Macrina, who is a microbiologist, are formally teaching students the manners and mores of research today. His syllabus reflects the issues, which include tricky questions of data manipulation and conflicts of interest. On a recent Tuesday afternoon, the subject was the delicate relationship between graduate students and the professors who act as their mentors. What about the mentor who encourages students to compete with one another? Or one who insists on being the lead author on a published article that was based on a student's ideas and a student's work? Every year, scientists say, more is at risk. With increasing corporate funding, there are questions of who owns data and what constitutes a conflict of interest. With data sharing on the Internet, there are questions of what is being revealed, and to whom, prior to publication. With larger and larger collaborations, there are questions of who is an author.
Dr. Gotzsche and Mr. Olsen say this study, and four others, do not meet agreed-upon standards for well-conducted and reliable research. They question whether the subjects who had mammograms might have been substantially healthier than those who did not, and whether deaths among women who had mammograms might be less likely to be ascribed to breast cancer than deaths among women who did not have them. ''The quality of the trials was very surprising because it is pretty low,'' Dr. Gotzsche said in a telephone interview. ''Even if they are judged by yesterday's standards, the quality is low. In some cases, we know why that happened -- these trials were conducted by people who were unfamiliar with clinical trial methodology. They were run by enthusiastic clinicians.'' The researchers cite with greater approval a more recent study in Malmo, Sweden, that compared 21,088 women who had mammograms to 21,195 who served as controls. After nearly nine years, 63 women in the mammogram group had died of breast cancer, compared with 66 in the control group -- an insignificant difference. The other study the researchers approved of, done in Canada, involved 44,925 women who had mammograms and 44,910 who did not. There were 120 deaths from breast cancer in the screened group and 111 among the women who served as controls.
''Around noon, I called Ray Gilmartin and told him what was up,'' Dr. Kim continued, referring to Merck's chief executive. ''He said, 'Figure out what was the best thing for patient safety.' We then spent Friday and the rest of the weekend going over the data and analyzing it in different ways and calling up medical experts to set up meetings where we would discuss the data and their interpretations and what to do.'' On Sunday night and Monday morning, Dr. Kim and his team spoke to researchers doing studies and to medical experts in rheumatology, cardiology and gastroenterology. Some, he said, told him to take the drug off the market right away. Others could not decide what recommendation to make. Rheumatologists, however, told him that there were patients who needed the drug. By late Monday morning, Dr. Kim had made his decision. ''We were going to withdraw,'' he said.
But because aspirin is a cheap nonprescription product, drug companies have not been particularly interested in investing the money required to determine whether it has anticancer effects. ''Much of the work was by academicians, not companies,'' said Dr. Ernest Hawk, who directs cancer prevention research at the National Cancer Institute. ''It was in the realm of interesting scientific observations, not drug development.'' That changed when two companies, Merck and Searle (now Pharmacia) developed drugs known as cox-2 inhibitors. Like aspirin, they reduce inflammation. And they seem to have the same effect as aspirin on cancer cells. But they cost far more than aspirin and require prescriptions. Dr. Hawk said the cancer institute had joined with Pharmacia, the maker of Celebrex, one of the new drugs, to sponsor 15 placebo-controlled studies of cancer prevention and treatment. Merck, which makes Vioxx, another cox-2 inhibitor, is doing studies on its own. Some of the first hints of a link between aspirin and cancer emerged in the 1970's when Dr. William R. Waddell of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center noticed that a similar drug, sulindac, actually seemed to make some colon polyps disappear in a few patients with a hereditary disease, familial adenomatous polyposis, which results in hundreds or thousands of polyps in the colon and rectum and a 100 percent chance that the person will eventually develop colon or rectal cancer.
He had another scan, using a special dye, to examine his kidney and learned that the lumps were renal cysts, a common and innocuous occurrence. In fact, Dr. Casarella said, half of all people over 50 have them. But the inch and a half lump on his liver was still a mystery even after another scan with a dye. So he had a biopsy. ''The pathologist couldn't tell whether it was benign or malignant,'' Dr. Casarella said. ''Then we had the lung lesions,'' he continued, which looked as if they could be cancer. He had two options: he could wait to see what happened. Or he could have a major operation to find out what they were. If they were cancer, however, the operation would not cure him because there were too many lumps and they were too large. ''I didn't want to sit around thinking I had a malignant lesion,'' he said. ''A lot of that was psychological -- I was either normal or I was terminal. It's kind of tough going around for a couple of years thinking about that.''
You're a man, 65 years old, and you've been having trouble urinating. Your doctor tells you that you have a cancer in your prostate making the gland press on the tube that carries urine. The good news is that the cancer seems confined to your prostate; there is no evidence that it has spread. Now you must make a decision. You can have an operation that removes your prostate. It may leave you impotent or incontinent. You may need to wear adult diapers. But a study from Sweden published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine finds that you will also reduce your risk of dying of prostate cancer by 50 percent. Do you want the surgery? Your doctor may then tell you the rest of the story: the study found that after an average of 6.2 years of follow-up there was no change in the overall death rate of men in the study. The number of men who died in those years was the same in the group that had the surgery as it was in the group that did not. Why should you care about the overall death rate? After all, your problem was prostate cancer. If the death rate from it was reduced, isn't that good?
Last Friday, the study investigators sent each of the women a letter, gingerly informing them that those who took estrogen were having slightly more heart attacks, strokes and blood clots in their legs and lungs than those taking the placebo. The total number of women who experienced these serious problems was very small, less than 1 percent of the women. And the effect seemed to  fade with time. But, the study investigators said, they had to tell the women about it. Another recent study, of women who already had heart disease, also found that hormone replacement therapy increased the likelihood of heart attacks and strokes for the first two years. Although the trend reversed itself in that study, the net effect of estrogen was neither to protect nor harm the heart. Many gynecologists were convinced by the weaker comparative studies, however. Dr. Nanette Wenger, a cardiologist at Emory University, said she went to a medical meeting recently and tried to explain the questions about hormone replacement therapy and heart disease to an audience of about 700 obstetricians and gynecologists. They were surprised, she said, telling her that they had thought that it was well known that estrogen prevented heart disease. As a result, Dr. Wenger said, ''often coronary disease is cited as the reason to prefer estrogen over other therapies.''
''A lot of people say, 'Gee, we don't know a lot about the risks of radiation,' '' Dr. Boice said. ''I say: 'We know a whole lot. We've studied populations all over the world since the turn of the last century. We know what happens at high doses. We know what happens at medical doses. And we know that at low doses the risks are low. The controversy is just how low are they. Are they really low or are they really, really low?' '' As with other toxic substances in the environment, the stricter the standards, the more it costs to meet them. The G.A.O. report last year, which had the subtitle ''Scientific Basis Inconclusive, and E.P.A. and N.R.C. Disagreement Continues,'' gave some examples of the costs of complying with standards setting different levels of radiation. The cost of cleaning soil around reactors and nuclear weapons facilities could range from thousands of dollars to more than $100 million, depending on whether the standard was an exposure of 15 or 25 millirem a year, the report said.
A lot of men who take alpha blockers report a 50 percent reduction in their symptoms, as measured on a scale that asks questions like how frequently they urinate during the day and at night, and how often their bladder empties incompletely. Another type of drug, finasteride, also known as Proscar, actually shrinks the prostate about 20 percent. By itself, Dr. McConnell said, it is not quite as useful as an alpha blocker. But in the long run, it reduces the risk that B.P.H. will progress. ''If the goal is to prevent or delay progression, the combination of the two therapies is better than either alone,'' he said. New data from the N.I.H. study predict which men with B.P.H. are likely to get worse over the years. A man's prostate must clearly be enlarged upon physical examination and he must have slightly elevated levels of a protein, P.S.A., whose levels soar when a man has prostate cancer.
In what some call a taste of the future of genetic medicine, Boston University has created a company to analye a valuable cache of medical data from a federally financed study that has lasted 52 years. The university expects that companies will want to use the data to facilitate the search for new drugs. The study, the Framingham Heart Study, is administered by theuniversity under contract with the ational Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. Begunin 1948, it has followed thousands of residents of the twon of Framingham, Mass., gathering medical data about them and, more recently, storing DNA. The data have always been public, and will continue to be freely available to researchers who request them, the university explained. And the study's participants, who are anonymous, will remain so. But the new company, Framingham Genomic Medicine, supported by $21 million from venture capitalists, will assemble the study's data in ways useful to companies or scientists. For example, researchers seeking clues to genes and environments that protect against heart disease will be able to sift through participants' medical histories and genetic data to home in on the information they want.
Heart disease researchers have long wondered what would happen if they increased people's H.D.L. levels. Many thought it would prevent heart attacks because H.D.L. is associated with a reduced risk of heart disease in epidemiological studies. They were stymied, however, in going further. They knew how to treat L.D.L. and so prevent cholesterol from being delivered to arteries. That was with statins, drugs that lower L.D.L. levels and, studies showed, prevent heart attacks. Companies tried, Dr. Rader said, looking for a pill to activate the H.D.L. genes. ''That's like a holy grail for the pharmaceutical industry,'' he said. ''It hasn't been found.'' A second, but obvious choice, would be to give people H.D.L., infusing it into their veins. But there was a problem. The idea of giving ordinary H.D.L. was in the public domain and not protected by patent and so companies were uninterested. There was, however, one patented H.D.L., and Dr. Roger Newton, the president and chief executive of Esperion Therapeutics, of Ann Arbor, Mich., licensed the rights to develop it. Dr. Newton had developed a cholesterol-lowering drug; he was a discoverer of Lipitor, the most prescribed statin in the United States. His goal in forming Esperion in 1998 was to develop H.D.L. therapies.
''I said to myself, 'I'm going to eat it,' '' Ms. Litman declared. But then, she told herself, ''If you do, you have to walk home from work and eat a salad for dinner.'' Which is exactly what she did. She plans ways to keep her portions small. ''If I buy a pound of grapes and leave them in a big package, I'll eat every one of them,'' she said. ''If I put them in baggies, I'll eat what's in a baggie.'' When she wants mint candy, she buys Junior Mints rather than a large mint patty and eats a few at a time. ''If you buy a mint patty, it's gone,'' Ms. Litman said. Others have more extreme regimens. ''I've been in pretty good shape now for decades,'' said Dr. Richard Wurtman, who directs the clinical research center at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''But it's only because of being concerned every day with what I eat and what I burn up.''
''Many physicians don't consider the consequences of false positives,'' Dr. Waxman said. Instead, he explained, they worry about the consequences for themselves if they counsel against a Pap test for the rare woman who turns out to have vaginal cancer. ''If the doctor didn't do a Pap test, then there's the litigation threat,'' he said. Dr. Noller said he tried to dissuade women who do not need Pap tests. ''I will present the facts to them,'' he said. ''I will try to talk them out of it.'' But, he said, ''if they still insist, I would probably do it.''
''A lot of people told me that what we had found was unimportant,'' Dr. Liggett said. ''They were wrong.'' Last year, in a paper in The Journal of Clinical Investigations, Dr. Liggett and his colleagues showed how the genetic variants affected disease prognosis in congestive heart failure. Reporting on tests of 259 patients who had come to the University of Cincinnati to be evaluated for possible heart transplants, the researchers found that those with one particular beta-2 adrenergic receptor gene variant did far worse than those with another. A third group was in the middle. Within 100 days after they arrived at the hospital, about 60 percent of the patients with an isoleucine amino acid at position 164 in the protein chain were dead or required a heart transplant. That is the variant that Mr. Wegele has. Patients with a different amino acid, threonine, at position 164, had a much better outcome. About 95 percent of them were alive after 100 days without having had a heart transplant, and half were still alive 900 days after they first arrived at the hospital.
WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW  Blood Pressure, Cholesterol and Smoking: Controlling the Risk Factors Can Provide Crucial Aid in Prevention Dr. Elizabeth Nabel, a practicing cardiologist and researcher studying the genesis of plaque in coronary arteries, became director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute on Feb. 1, 2005. A firm believer in prevention, she exercises vigorously nearly every day and can recite her blood pressure, blood cholesterol and body mass index. She thinks everyone should know five things about heart disease: A KILLER -- Heart disease is the leading killer, killing one in four women and one in four men. PREVENTION -- The overwhelming majority of heart disease could be prevented by controlling blood pressure, cholesterol and cigarette smoking. About 85 percent of people who had fatal heart attacks had at least one of these risk factors. Men 45 and older and women over age 65 should take an aspirin every day to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Those at high risk should take up to 325 mg daily; all other men and women over 65 but at lower risk should consider 81 mg a day or 100 mg every other day. Consult with your doctor before starting aspirin.
One problem is to stop outbreaks when not everyone has been immunized. With smallpox, that can be done. It is clear when people are infected: they break out in horrible pox. This makes it possible to identify and isolate them and to trace their contacts. With polio, Dr. Robbins said, most people who are infected never realize it, and so when immunization is incomplete, the disease can spread. Polio patients usually develop mild, temporary gastrointestinal symptoms. Rarely do people suffer the paralysis that makes polio so terrifying. A World Health Organization campaign began in 1988 with the goal of eradicating polio by 2000. It reduced the number of reported cases from 350,000 in 1988 to 3,500 in 2000, but the disease remains in 20 countries, mostly in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. It also helps to know how many people are immune to the disease. With smallpox, scars mark those who have recovered and the vaccination leaves a distinctive mark. But the only way to know if someone is immune to polio is to look for antibodies to the virus in their blood.
But a past president of the orthopedic surgeons' academy, Dr. Douglas Jackson of Long Beach, Calif., said that the study's population, mostly men in a veterans' hospital, was not typical of what he had seen in his private practice, but that he would tell his patients about their experience. The research began when an orthopedic surgeon at the Houston veterans' hospital, Dr. J. Bruce Moseley, who is now the team physician for Houston's two professional basketball teams, approached Dr. Wray suggesting a study that would compare washing the knee joint with washing and scraping in patients with arthritis. Dr. Wray had a bolder idea. ''She said, 'How do you know that what you are seeing is not a placebo effect?' '' Dr. Moseley recalled. ''My response was, 'This is surgery.' She said, 'I hate to tell you this, but surgery may have the biggest placebo effect of all.' '' Placebo studies of surgery are almost never done. Many doctors consider them unethical because patients could undergo risks with no benefits. Working with Dr. Brody, the ethicist, the group tried to make the placebo treatment no more dangerous than daily life. Still, of 324 consecutive patients who were asked to participate, 144 declined.
At the National Institute on Aging, scientists have come to the opposite conclusion. The institute had two studies under way testing whether hormone replacement therapy could prevent or slow the course of Alzheimer's disease. Less definitive studies had shown an association between taking hormones and a lower incidence of Alzheimer's. One Alzheimer's study supported by the institute on aging involves 900 women, 65 or older, with a close relative who had the disease, doubling or tripling their own chances of getting it. Those who had uteruses took Prempro; the others, just estrogen. A group overseeing the study decided that the women's risk of Alzheimer's was so high and that it was so important to know if estrogen could lower their risk that continuing the study was worth the gamble. The other study, which involved women who already had Alzheimer's, was testing an estrogen patch in combination with progestin for women with uteruses and by itself for women who had had hysterectomies. The hope was that it might slow the course of the disease. It was a question that had been addressed before, in three studies that tested Prempro. Those studies found no benefit from the hormones, said Dr. Neil Buckholtz, who is chief of the institute's division on dementias of aging.
Ten years after the study began, there was no benefit from breast self-examination. Like the women in China, the Russians who examined their breasts had the same mortality rate as those who did not. Their cancers were not found earlier, but they had more biopsies for benign lumps. The scientists who conducted the study in China cautioned that it was not certain what their data meant for women in developed countries who have regular mammograms. The scientists say they cannot conclude that self-examination would help the women survive breast cancer or that self-exams would find cancers earlier than they might otherwise be detected. The scientists wrote that women who chose the self-exam ''should be informed that its efficacy is unproven and that it may increase their chances of having a benign breast biopsy.'' In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Russell Harris and Dr. Linda S. Kinsinger of the University of North Carolina say that the study should spur doctors to change their advice to women. Until there is evidence that there is a benefit from self-exams, they wrote, ''North American physicians can stop spending time routinely teaching women's fingers to do'' breast exams.
But, the researchers wrote, they compared the heat shock proteins made by unexposed worms that served as controls, with those made by worms that were bombarded with microwaves. The investigators kept the fluid in the petri dishes at various temperatures and noted when the worms made heat shock proteins. At a certain temperature, all the worms make the proteins. But those exposed to microwaves made them when the fluid was slightly cooler by about three degrees centigrade than those that were not exposed to microwaves, they reported. Some scientists questioned how the results could be translated to infer possible risks to human health. ''Frankly I can't see what this has to do with children using cell phones,'' said Dr. Eleanor Adair, who is a senior scientist at Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, studying electromagnetic radiation effects. ''It's terribly difficult to make accurate measurements of temperatures in petri dishes because the temperature varies all over the place,'' Dr. Adair said.
An expert panel of the Census Bureau  recommended that the census not be adjusted, but its decision neatly sidestepped Democratic arguments about its failure to fully  count minorities and poor people and Republican defenses that the Constitution calls for an ''actual enumeration.'' The panel's reasoning: it could not conclude that an adjustment would bring the census any closer to the truth. The commerce secretary, Donald L. Evans, said he relied on the panel's conclusion in deciding last week that unadjusted census figures would be used to draw up Congressional districts and distribute federal money to the states. The reason it is hard to make the census more accurate is because methodological improvements have already lifted accuracy nearly as high as it seems able to go, said David Freedman, a statistics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. In 1990, the national population count was 98 to 99 percent accurate, he said, and in 2000 it was even better. To improve further, scientists have to work within the remaining margin of error, using statistical methods to get better estimates of the number of people who were not counted, but should have been, and those who were counted, but should not have been.
''We looked at vasomotor symptoms and also difficulty concentrating and in women who had forgetfulness or mood swings,'' she said. But, she added, ''there was no difference whether they reported those symptoms or not.'' ''Then we said, 'Let's just look at the 50- to 54-year-olds who also reported moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms. There were 574 women in that group, which makes it one of the largest clinical trials for quality of life,'' she said. ''The only measure that was statistically significant was sleep. We saw a one-point improvement on a 20-point scale.'' The drugs did alleviate hot flashes, but even then the data were surprising, Dr. Hays said. There were 2,000 women in the study who reported moderate-to-severe hot flashes at the study's start. Among those taking Prempro, 77 percent reported that their hot flashes were eased. But so did 52 percent in the placebo group. ''We will never know how much of this is a placebo effect and how much is the natural history of menopause,'' Dr. Hays said, explaining that hot flashes gradually diminish over time so that two-thirds of women are better within five years.
Larry Spears, a director of enforcement at the F.D.A., says the agency is still investigating. ''We have a number of different lab results for the same product,'' he said. ''We need to find out what happened -- and we will.'' Ms. Davis, who said the company was working on getting its studies published in the United States, also says Boston Scientific's tests indicate that reprocessed devices can have subtle changes in their functions that could be devastating to patients. Other safety studies were published in leading medical journals. In one, Dr. Richard A. Kozarek, who is chief of gastroenterology at Virginia Mason Medical Center in Seattle, examined the reuse of an argon beam plasma coagulation probe, a $190 device that is used to stop bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract. If used 10 times, it would cost $24 per procedure, even with the cost of cleaning and sterilizing; if used five times, it would cost $42. The device was first introduced in Europe and Asia, labeled for multiple use. It even came with instructions for cleaning, Dr. Kozarek said. A few years ago, it was introduced in the United States, labeled for single use only.
To avoid asking women to decide whether they want to give up a weapon in this war, Dr. Lerner said, many doctors are acting as though the scientific questions are not serious. Last week, for example, Dr. Stephen Brenner, an internist in private practice in New Haven, asked his female staff and a male resident a pointed question: was there anything to this new debate over whether mammography lowers the death rate from breast cancer? The unanimous response, Dr. Brenner said, was that the entire argument was without foundation. ''It's just a way for insurance companies to save money,'' they told him. In the meantime, he said, not a single patient has told him she questions the value of mammograms. But ultimately, said Dr. Lerner, the data do cast doubt on long-held beliefs -- and they do not replace them with definitive answers. ''This is a story of the limits of evidence in science,'' he said.
''Because we had cases we thought were pertussis and because we had vulnerable patients at the hospital, we lowered our threshold,'' she said. Anyone who had a cough got a P.C.R. test, and so did anyone with a runny nose who worked with high-risk patients like infants. ''That's how we ended up with 134 suspect cases,'' Dr. Kirkland said. And that, she added, was why 1,445 health care workers ended up taking antibiotics and 4,524 health care workers at the hospital, or 72 percent of all the health care workers there, were immunized against whooping cough in a matter of days. ''If we had stopped there, I think we all would have agreed that we had had an outbreak of pertussis and that we had controlled it,'' Dr. Kirkland said. But epidemiologists at the hospital and working for the States of New Hampshire and Vermont decided to take extra steps to confirm that what they were seeing really was pertussis.
Others are not convinced. Richard H. Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers, said he had serious concerns about the reconstruction of the virus. ''There is a risk verging on inevitability, of accidental release of the virus; there is also a risk of deliberate release of the virus.'' And the 1918 flu virus, Dr. Ebright added, ''is perhaps the most effective bioweapons agent ever known.'' But Dr. D.A. Henderson, a resident scholar at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Biosecurity and a leading expert on bioterrorism, said he agreed with the decision to reconstruct the virus and publish its genetic sequence. ''This work is of the greatest importance, and it is very important that it be published,'' he said. The story of the resurrection of the 1918 flu began in 1995. Until then, scientists had thought the task hopeless. Viruses had not been discovered in 1918, so no one had isolated and saved the one that caused the flu.
Dr. Hwang said he knew that the work would elicit strong responses but that the research was so important it should be done anyway, adding that there was strict oversight by an ethics committee. ''Of course,'' he said, ''we acknowledge that there will be controversy. But as scientists, we think it is our obligation to do this.'' The paper describes the successful process in detail, with precise information on how to start the embryos growing and what solutions are best to nourish them. That recipe appears to advance the likelihood of reproductive cloning. When fertility laboratories fertilize eggs, grow embryos to the same developmental stage as the embryo clones and implant them in a human uterus, 40 to 60 percent end up as babies. The scientists stress that all the research was in the laboratory, in petri dishes. No embryo was implanted in a woman. The women who provided unfertilized eggs that were needed to start the cloning process were not paid.
The women taking Prempro did have slight benefits in three measures: sleep disturbances, physical functioning and bodily pain. But, Dr. Hays said, those were ''almost imperceptible and not clinically meaningful.'' The differences in sleep disturbances amounted to 0.4 point in a 20-point scale, physical functioning was 0.8 point on a 100-point scale, and pain was 1.9 points on a 100-point scale. Even those differences vanished after three years of hormone therapy. The researchers were taken aback, Dr. Hays said, and cast about for explanations. ''Maybe we looked at the wrong women,'' she said, noting that the study had been criticized because most of the women in it were long past menopause. They decided to focus on subsets of women in the study. ''We thought, 'Let's just look at the younger women and women with symptoms of menopause,' '' Dr. Hays said. But even then, she said, ''we saw no differences depending on age or whether they reported symptoms at baseline.'' They continued to comb the data, asking if there were quality of life effects for women who had particular complaints.
''If you had an abnormally low blood sugar level, would you be surprised if you got hungry and agitated?'' Dr. Leibel said. Yet, he added, few would question that such behavior is driven by the brain, independently of willpower or free will. Support for Range Theory Dr. Leibel and others say that the existence of preset weight ranges is consistent with results from voluminous research on dieting. For example, an expert panel convened by The National Institutes of Health, reviewing the most rigorous studies it could find, said that dieters lose an average of 8 percent of their weight, 16  pounds for a 200-pound woman, for example, after dieting for three months to a year and that the goal after six months of dieting should be to simply maintain whatever weight was lost. In fact, obesity researchers say, looking back, they have had hints since the 1930's that there is a system in the hypothalamus in the brain that seems to control eating.
But Dr. William Catalona, director of the prostate cancer program at Northwestern University, said he was primarily responsible for generating interest in using the P.S.A. as a screening tool, first advocating its use at a 1988 meeting of the National Cancer Institute. The test finds a protein, the prostate specific antigen, that is released by prostate cells. Its levels go up slightly early in the course of cancer, but also when the prostate grows larger as a man ages. When cancer is advanced, P.S.A. levels soar into the thousands, but the test is looking at levels where only a biopsy could tell whether or not cancer was present. Dr. Catalona knew that, but, he said, given the seriousness of the disease, ''we were willing to pay that price.'' Not everyone agreed. ''I was howled down,'' at the cancer institute, he said. ''They were looking for something like a pregnancy test; when it was positive you always had cancer and when it was negative you never did.''
The company decided to withdraw the drug from pharmacy shelves after a study that it had hoped would show that Vioxx prevented colon polyps, which can sometimes become cancerous. Merck quickly ended the trial after the results of the study showed last week that the drug led to heart attacks and strokes. The risk was small -- 15 cases of heart attack, stroke or blood clots per thousand people over three years compared with 7.5 such events per thousand patients taking a placebo. But the data were so unambiguous that Merck told federal regulators this week that it had halted the trial and would take the drug off the market; it announced that decision yesterday. ''What we found in this study is that beginning after 18 months, there was a discernible and unexpected increase in cardiovascular disease rates,'' Dr. Peter S. Kim, president of Merck Research Labs, said in an interview yesterday.
A recent clinical trial involving very sick people indicated that the devices were effective. But Dr. Alan Garber, a physician and economist at Stanford University, said the question was not whether they worked. ''The big question is, 'In whom else does it work?' '' he said. ''The people in the trial had extraordinarily severe congestive heart failure and were being kept alive in intensive care units. That's the tip of the iceberg in congestive heart failure.'' ''We seem to be getting new technologies that are effective for common conditions, like congestive heart failure, like emphysema,'' he went on. ''If you are talking about a treatment for a rare genetic disorder that affected 500 or even 1,000 patients a year it would not make much difference. But in the case of L.V.A.D.'s, or with lung volume reduction surgery, the potential number who will get it is quite large so it will force the issue. How are we going to make it available to Medicare beneficiaries without wrecking the Medicare budget?''
The university was about to offer the job to Dr. Ribisl but decided at the last minute to interview Dr. Costill, he later learned. He still does not know who sent him the ad. ''The envelope had a Columbus, Ohio, stamp on it. That's all I could ever find out.'' Arriving at Ball State, Dr. Costill learned that there was little money to study sports, so he decided to seek some. Gatorade had just come onto the market, he said, so he wrote to the company and suggested a study on dehydration among marathon runners. A company doctor called him back. ''He said, 'I'm really excited by your idea but there is one problem: you asked for $800,' '' Dr. Costill recalled. ''I said, 'Oh, gee.' Then he said, 'You ought to add another zero to that.' '' Astonished, Dr. Costill did, and used the money to buy laboratory equipment. That was the beginning of a long career in which he pursued every avenue to scrounge money for research in a field that had never been lavishly financed. At the same time, he avoided making deals or giving endorsements.
Dr. Schwab named the method damage control, a Navy term he recalled from the 10 years he spent on an aircraft carrier in Vietnam. When a ship was hit, he recalled, the idea was to patch it up and keep it afloat, doing the major repairs later. He tried it with trauma victims. ''We would control bleeding and any contamination from the GI tract,'' he said. ''Then we would continue to resuscitate them and bring them back in two or three days and do definite surgery.'' To assess the method, he compared patients treated with damage control with similar, seriously injured patients who had had traditional surgery. With damage control, 75 percent survived. With traditional surgery, almost every patient died. A decade later, after further refining of the technique, 90 percent are surviving, Dr. Schwab said. As the approach spread in trauma centers across the country, military surgeons started showing up at Dr. Schwab's hospital for training.
Three years ago, Dr. Beatrice Hahn got a call from a colleague asking if she wanted some body parts from a chimpanzee that had died a decade ago. The colleague said, ''I have the spleen, the brain and the lymph nodes in my freezer. I need to clean my freezer, so before I throw it out, do you want to look at it?'' Then the scientist said the animal had antibodies in its blood very much like ones that people develop when they are infected with the AIDS virus. Dr. Hahn leapt at the chance. It was a long shot, but it was possible that the long-dead chimpanzee could be a missing link in the search for the origins of AIDS. A few days later, Federal Express delivered a huge box of frozen chimpanzee parts, packed in dry ice, to Dr. Hahn's laboratory at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where she is a professor of medicine.
It is hard to see evidence of steganography in such files because the detection methods look for statistical evidence that an image's data have been distorted. But JPEG files are distorted by their very nature -- the digital data are altered when the files are compressed to send them electronically. Dr. Fridrich said that a steganography detection program she developed also had that limitation but that she had greatly improved the program so that, even though it still did  not work well for JPEG images, it was much better at finding images in other formats. She said she was providing it to the Air Force, which was paying for her group's work. ''I believe that the Air Force made this program available to other government agencies,'' she said. The best published method for finding steganography in JPEG files, Dr. Fridrich said, is one developed by Niels Provos, a graduate student at the University of Michigan. Mr. Provos said he had seen no steganography in the two million images from eBay he had examined.
The federal Medicare program is expected to decide this week whether to pay for an aggressive and expensive lung operation that could offer a lifeline to tens of thousands of elderly patients. But health economists and medical experts say the treatment, however alluring, is part of an unsettling trend: new and ever pricier treatments for common medical conditions that are part and parcel of aging -- procedures that could potentially benefit tens of thousands of patients, at a total cost that would far exceed the kind of prescription drug benefit now being considered by Congress. The questions, these experts say, are how much Medicare can or should pay, and whether cost-effectiveness should enter into the decisions. The procedure under consideration this week is an operation for people with severe emphysema, whose lungs are so scarred that they are constantly out of breath. In keeping with its policies, the government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services has consulted with medical experts and professional societies and says it expects to issue its decision as early as tomorrow.
Before ICSI, said Dr. Sherman Silber, the director of the Infertility Center of St. Louis, at best 5 percent of infertile men could be treated. Now, he said, 99 percent can father children. The method, he added, ''has completely revolutionized the treatment of male infertility.'' It is so successful, Dr. Silber said, that some infertility centers do not even bother with normal fertilization, but simply inject each man's sperm into his partner's egg, reasoning that fertilization rates will be higher with ICSI. But even as the technique was coming into wide use in people, some biologists wondered about its safety. The question was difficult to study in the usual small mammals, like hamsters and mice, because the molecular biology of fertilization is different in these animals and even the size and texture of their eggs differ. Until Dr. Schatten's studies, no one had used ICSI on any primate other than humans.
A new study of fillets from 700 salmon, wild and farmed, finds that the farmed fish consistently have more PCB's and other contaminants, but at levels far below the limits set by the federal government. The study, the largest so far to look at contaminants in salmon, is being published today in the journal Science. It found more than a sevenfold difference in PCB levels, with farmed salmon having an average of 36.63 parts per billion and wild salmon having 4.75. The authors advised people to limit their consumption of salmon. ''Although the risk/benefit computation is complicated,'' they wrote, ''consumption of farmed Atlantic salmon may pose risks that detract from the beneficial effects of fish consumption.'' Dr. Barbara Knuth, a study author who is chairwoman of the department of natural resources at Cornell University, said, ''It indicates that the vast majority of farm-raised Atlantic salmon should be consumed at one meal or less per month.''
Scientists report today that they have used a precise molecular recipe to turn normal human cells into cancer cells in the laboratory, triumphing in a task that sounded simple but that had eluded molecular biologists for more than 15 years. In the end, what was required was just three genes. One pushed cells to grow unrelentingly, one inactivated signals for cells to stop growing, and the third released a brake on the cells' life span. The work, by Dr. Robert A. Weinberg and his colleagues at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Mass., is published today in the journal Nature. It is accompanied by a commentary, by Dr. Jonathan B. Weitzman and Dr. Moshe Yaniv of the Institut Pasteur in Paris, calling it a ''landmark paper.'' While the discovery does not lead immediately to a new treatment or cure for human cancer, some researchers hope it will help lead to an early test for cancer. Others said it would enable them to cut through the thicket of genetic alterations that they see in naturally occurring human cancer cells and learn pathways for turning healthy cells into tumors.
Exercise physiologists say there are three components to great running: A high VO2 max, the volume of oxygen an athlete can consume at maximum exertion; great running efficiency, a measurement of the energy used to run at a particular pace; and an ability to keep going at a high level of exertion for a long time, expressed as the percentage of VO2 max that can be sustained during a run. Athletes with a high VO2 max can pump large volumes of blood to their muscles, usually because they have large and powerful hearts, said Dr. Paul Ribisl, an exercise physiologist and a runner at Wake Forest University. The heart of an average adult pumps about 15 liters a minute. The heart of an elite distance runner typically pumps at least twice that amount. VO2 max increases with training, as a person goes from physically unfit to physically fit. But, physiologists say, even when elite runners are out of training -- when they have not run for months or longer -- they have a VO2 max substantially higher than that of a recreational runner.
Women who had implants to augment their breasts had about a 24 percent chance of needing to go back to the operating room in three to five years to repair problems or complications with implants, Dr. Ernster said. Those who had implants after a mastectomy had a 23 to 40 percent chance of needing a second operation in three to five years. In recent years, most women who had implants have received devices filled with saline -- salt water -- rather than silicone, Dr. Bondurant said. Preliminary studies suggest that these devices have fewer complications, with just a 1 percent to 3 percent chance of deflation per year, he said, but more research is needed. Sybil Goldrich, founder of Command Trust Network, an information clearinghouse for women with silicone problems, said in a telephone interview that rupture was ''not a trivial problem.'' Women whose implants rupture, she said, can ''end up with a lifetime of medical bills that can be staggering.''
Other common medical conditions have not been systematically studied, but Dr. Lindenauer said he would not be surprised if the same held true -- community hospitals will be at least as good as major medical centers for ordinary illnesses. ''A colleague of mine drew an analogy to driving and the idea that you just need to be a good enough driver to avoid accidents,'' he said. Beyond that, he said, ''we don't really differentiate that much between great and good enough.'' The situation is different for more-complex matters like heart surgery and cancer care, researchers say. In such cases, where you go can matter -- a lot, depending on the condition. ''Not that I want to oversimplify to this degree, but for cardiovascular care, pick a very busy, high-volume surgeon,'' said Dr. John D. Birkmeyer, a professor of surgery at the University of Michigan who has analyzed Medicare data. ''For cancer care, focus on the hospital.''
FOUR nanograms of prostate specific antigen, or P.S.A., per milliliter. For more than a decade, that has been the line between normal and abnormal on a common annual blood test used to screen for prostate cancer. Above four and you need a biopsy of your prostate to look for cancer. Below four and you go home. But a new study, published last week in The New England Journal of Medicine, showed that no matter how low his P.S.A. level, a man could have prostate cancer. In addition, it has long been known that men whose prostates are enlarged, a normal consequence of aging, can also have P.S.A. levels indistinguishable from those with early prostate cancer. So the question arises: How did four become the standard? Even some leading urologists say they aren't sure. Dr. E. David Crawford, the head of urologic oncology at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, says a 1986 paper by a test maker, Hybritech (now part of Beckman Coulter), proposed that number as the divider between normal and abnormal P.S.A. levels.
But it was thought that leptin acted like most other hormones, attaching itself to brain cells and directly altering their activities. Investigators did not anticipate that leptin could actually change connections in the brain, strengthening circuits that inhibit eating and weakening ones that spur appetite. And few considered the possibility that there might be a critical period early in life when the hormone shaped the brain's circuitry, possibly affecting appetite and obesity in adulthood. ''It's fascinating,'' said Dr. Rudolph Leibel of Columbia University. ''Obviously, we don't know what this looks like in humans, but it is possible that some of the differences in regulation of body weight that have been attributed to psychological processes or fat cell effects may be reflecting these central nervous system processes.'' Dr. Jeffrey Flier of Beth Israel-Deaconess Hospital in Boston said the effects of leptin reminded him of brain changes when memories are stored. It is almost as if the brain is developing a memory for the weight it wants the animals to be, Dr. Flier said, raising intriguing possibilities about weight regulation in people.
The moment the little boy was born, the hospital staff knew there was something unusual about him. His muscles looked nothing like the soft baby muscles of the other infants in the nursery. They were bulging and well defined, especially in his thighs and upper arms. ''Everybody noticed,'' said Dr. Markus Schuelke, a pediatric neurologist at Charit√© University Medical Center in Berlin. The baby, it turned out in the first such documented case in a human, had a double dose of a genetic mutation that causes immense strength in mice and cattle. Drugs are under development that, investigators hope, will use the same principle to help people whose muscles are wasting from muscular dystrophy or other illnesses. Experts say the little boy, now 4 1/2 and still very strong, offers human evidence for the theory behind such drugs. The boy's story, written by Dr. Schuelke and colleagues, appears today in The New England Journal of Medicine.
''It's a double betrayal,'' he said, ''first to ignore the contribution of patients in past studies and then to ask for the same contribution from future patients.'' Moreover, he said, in this case researchers could have found all the previous studies simply by typing ''aprotinin'' into a medical database. In addition, despite the previous studies, a recent statistical analysis of 4,374 patients, led by Dr. Dennis T. Mangano of the Ischemia Research and Education Foundation in San Bruno, Calif., found that aprotinin may increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure. The statistical evidence that led to this conclusion, however, could not have shown up in the many small-scale studies of the drug. But Dr. Gregory Nuttall of the Mayo Clinic said that while it may seem that the time for using placebos in aprotinin studies had come and gone, that question ''is never as cut and dried as it seems.''
Dr. Fallon said he saw many such patients in his private practice and would continue to refer them to colleagues for long-term treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Dr. Sigal said, however, that in addition to the expense of long-term intravenous antibiotics -- and some patients end up taking them for years -- the drugs are dangerous. Some patients have died of infections caused by the catheters in their bodies, and others have experienced side effects from the drugs, including destruction of bone marrow, requiring a bone marrow transplant. ''These are not benign drugs --  they're all poisons,'' Dr. Sigal said. When they are needed to fight an infection, their risks, of course, are outweighed by their benefits. But when there are no benefits, he added, the risks are naturally unacceptable.
Many scientists have longed to know whether Dolly's telomeres are of normal length. To make Dolly, Dr. Wilmut and his colleagues slipped an udder cell from a six-year-old sheep into a sheep's egg whose own genetic material had been removed. Using the udder cell's genes as a blueprint, the egg divided and grew, eventually becoming Dolly, who is a clone, an identical twin of the sheep whose udder cell was used to create her. The udder cell that was used to create Dolly had shortened telomeres, the Roslin scientists report in their paper, which is what they expected because the animal was 6 years old, ancient for a sheep. And, most important for telomere length, the udder cell had been grown in the laboratory before it was used for cloning, a process that is known to markedly erode telomeres. The question was, would Dolly's telomeres be short, commensurate with her origins in an aged, laboratory-cultured cell?
It's a prospect that is still very much on the horizon, and it is impossible to predict when, or even if, it will lead to treatments. But at least in the eyes of many scientists, the possibilities are real. ''It is an explosive topic with very important therapeutic implications,'' said Dr. Pier Paolo Pandolfi, the head of the molecular and developmental biology laboratory at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The story of how and why the process was discovered dates to 1982, when the first human cancer gene, ras, was found in bladder cancers. Like the many other cancer genes that have been found since, it was a normal gene that had been mutated so that it no longer functioned. Ras turned healthy-looking normal cells into cancer cells, with ugly jumbled chromosomes and wild, uncontrolled growth. There was one glitch, but few paid it much attention. The ras gene did not convert every type of cell into cancer, and in particular, it seemed to work best with one type of cell. Those were so-called immortalized cells.
''Their perception is very different from the scientific perception,'' Dr. Gammon said of the Long Island women. ''They live day to day with the fear that's out there, and I live with the scientists, knowing that the majority of scientists don't believe there is an environmental cause of breast cancer.'' She also takes calls, many calls, from the worried public. One, she said, from a panicked woman, was typical. ''She said, 'I have to move to Long Island. Where is it safe?' '' It turned out that the woman was living in Bergen County. ''I explained to her that where she lived had a higher rate of breast cancer than where she was moving to,'' Dr. Gammon said. ''You could hear the silence on the other end of the phone.'' News Analysis
Staff members said in a survey that they would never go back to the old system. ''I just knew there had to be a better way,'' Dr. Sargent said. ''I just wish I had thought of it.'' Patients in Groups Dr. John Scott, a geriatrician at a Kaiser Permanente clinic near Denver, had his own problems with the way medical offices were run -- and came up with his own solution. His breaking point came one morning when he realized that every patient he saw had gotten short shrift. ''Every time I closed the door on a patient, I knew there were other things that should be addressed,'' Dr. Scott said, ''but in 20-minute visits, you just don't have the time.'' Wondering why things had gone awry, he decided that doctors were focusing on the wrong group of patients. Everything was set up to help patients with acute problems --  heart attacks, bleeding. But most had chronic diseases and their needs could not be satisfied by doctors who had time for little more than checking their blood pressure and pulse.
''The message to really consider when you look at the yellow fever in 1793 and anthrax today is that panic results from a lack of knowledge,'' said Dr. Allen R. Myers, president of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia and professor of medicine at Temple University. ''In the 1790's, we had useless treatment and we certainly had no understanding of the epidemiology of the disease,'' Dr. Myers said. ''In the case of anthrax, we know a great deal about the organism but we're really trying to understand more about the transmission.'' Of course, the anthrax attacks, while terrifying, have had nothing like the death toll of that yellow fever epidemic, which killed about 55,000 people in Philadelphia. To put it in perspective, said Dr. Marc Micozzi, the executive director of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, it would be as if a disease were to sweep through Washington and its suburbs today killing about 400,000 people between late August and November.
But, Dr. Wasson added, it may take a while. ''If you look at it from a five-year point of view, it will make a huge difference,'' he said. At first, he predicted, many doctors will bide their time, to see just how good Vista is. Dr. Alan Garber, a Stanford University economist and internist, said of the Medicare plan: ''It's a good idea. It's not foolproof.'' But, Dr. Garber added, Medicare's investment and the program's many appealing features ''are all signals that it might be around for a long time and a doctor in a small office would not be taking an enormous risk.'' Medicare has not estimated what its software giveaway is worth. But Duncan Pringle, chief Vista technologist at Perot Systems, said that each doctor in a practice paid about $20,000 to $25,000 to get started with a commercial system, including costs of software, a license fee charged to each doctor, installation and servicing.
Makers of prescription estrogens and progestins take a different tack, he said. Because those drugs are regulated by the F.D.A., they may not make unproven claims. ''I have been bombarded with very subtle ads,'' Dr. Schiff said. ''They can't say their product is safer because they don't have the evidence.'' Instead, he said, they try an indirect approach: '' 'We make product ABC and we don't make the product that was involved in the Women's Health Initiative.' It is like having a bad relative and making sure you don't sit next to them. They are pushing themselves away from the table.'' Dr. Marcia L. Stefanick of Stanford University, the principal investigator for the Women's Health Initiative, said some doctors were too quick to say that the risks of Prempro were specific to Prempro but not to other formulations of estrogens and progestins -- or that estrogens from plants were safe because they are ''natural.''
But many women and their doctors said that the drugs had quality-of-life benefits that overrode their small health risks. They not only relieved symptoms of menopause, like hot flashes and night sweats, many women said, but also made them feel more energetic, made sex more pleasurable, improved their memories and gave them mental clarity. The slight health risks, they said, were well worth it. The new data cast doubt on that belief, investigators said. The results will be published in the May 8 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, but the journal released the results yesterday, saying they were too important to hold. Medical experts cautioned that the study did not include the minority of women with symptoms so severe that they were ineligible, unable to accept the possibility of taking a placebo. In addition, they said, the memory test was not sensitive enough to pick up subtle changes. A study that could pick up such changes will be published soon.
''We used to say try a diet first, but we realized that wasn't working,'' Dr. Grundy said. ''Now we say if you are at high risk, you're supposed to start drugs simultaneously with diet. For the others, we used to say try six months of diet. Now we say three months; at least we give them a chance.'' Some doctors are prescribing doses that are too low, Dr. Cleeman said. ''I believe that doctors give a starting dose of a drug and don't ratchet it up to get enough L.D.L. lowering,'' he said. Many doctors and patients worry about side effects, but the drugs are very safe, he added. One that was more risky, Baycol, was taken off the market. The heart institute, along with the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, wrote a paper on statins' risks (www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines /cholesterol/statins.html) noting that the worst side effect, severe muscle disease that can be fatal if the drugs are not stopped, afflicts less than one patient in a million. Other problems -- muscle breakdown in one patient in a thousand and elevated liver enzyme in about 1 percent, may require that a person take a lower dose of the drug, change to a statin made by another company or stop taking the drug temporarily.
He pleaded, ''I urge you, please, cast a vote for embryonic stem cell research.'' The idea of stem cell research is to take embryo cells that have the potential to become any type of cell, be it liver, heart, nerve, pancreas or blood, and grow them in petri dishes, adding chemicals to turn them into replacement cells to cure disease. A person with diabetes, for example, would get pancreas cells to replace ones that have died. Someone with Parkinson's disease would get replacement brain cells. Researchers, however, have not yet cured any disease or even routinely turned embryo cells into specific adult cells. They got furthest in mice, where they converted mouse stem cells into brain cells like those lost in Parkinson's and into blood cells. Dr. Ronald McKay, a stem cell researcher at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, counseled patience. ''We are essentially getting cells to differentiate without the rest of the embryo,'' Dr. McKay said. ''That has to be controlled and it has to be controlled in the lab. It's tricky stuff and it will take quite a while to figure out.''
But Dr. Robinson is the first to say that there are more questions than answers about why a growing number of American children are obese. Is his program a way to help curb the trend, or will the children, already subject to the social miseries of being overweight, end up feeling like failures? Will they lose little or no weight? Or will they lose weight only to regain it? The statistics on fat children are not encouraging. From 1976 to 1980, the National Center for Health Statistics reported, 6.5 percent of children ages 6 to 11 were overweight, defined as heavier than 95 percent of children of the same age in population studies in the 1960's and 1970's. A decade later, that fraction had nearly doubled. From 1990 to 1994, the center said, 11.4 percent of children in that age group were overweight. Mexican-American children, like those in Dr. Robinson's program, appear to be among the most affected, although it is not clear why. National statistics show that  from 1990 to 1994 the percentage of overweight Mexican-American children increased to 17.7 percent from 13.3 percent in the period 1976 to 1980.
''The last trial of unmodified hemoglobin was in 1978,'' Dr. Gould said. Researchers from Warner Lambert gave tiny amounts of the protein to six healthy volunteers. ''They saw these toxicities,'' he said. ''It happened 100 percent of the time, to every one of them.'' Dr. Gould called one of the drug company scientists. ''He said: 'It's worse than it sounds in the paper. It scared the daylights out of us.' '' But it appears that the toxicities disappear if the hemoglobin molecules are linked together in chains. The only problem, Dr. Gould said, is that virtually no small unlinked hemoglobin molecules can be in the mixture. ''We gradually started to purify,'' he said, testing the substance in baboons and finding that he had to go below 1 percent unlinked hemoglobin or the artificial blood was dangerous. With its solution of purified chains of hemoglobin, the company began small studies and was buoyed by success. Doctors have given as much as 20 units, or pints, of the artificial blood, PolyHeme, in 20 minutes, Dr. Gould said. An adult normally has about 10 units of blood. But with a severely injured patient, blood loss can be so rapid that it is lost as quickly as it is given, necessitating transfusions of 20 or even 30 units.
Others drew fine distinctions over what it meant to have a capacity to develop into a human being. They pointed out that Dr. Nagy and Dr. Rossant had to wrap their embryonic stem cells in an artificial placenta when they dropped them into a female mouse's uterus. The ''placenta'' was a clump of genetically disabled cells that could not grow or become part of the developing fetus but could temporarily protect the stem cells and help them attach to the uterine wall. Dr. Nagy and Dr. Rossant ''had to manipulate'' the embryonic stem cells, said Dr. Skirboll, ''so that they would at least look like they're developing along the lines of an embryo.'' Dr. John Gearhart of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who led one of the two research groups that isolated human embryonic stem cells, said the real question was whether the stem cells by themselves could grow into a person. ''The bottom line has to be that these cells in and of themselves are not capable of doing that,'' he said.
Macie Mull was 82 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade when she developed pneumonia. Her nursing home rushed her to the hospital where she spent the night, receiving intravenous antibiotics. The next day she was back at the nursing home, more confused than ever. Now she was choking on her pur√©ed food; eating was becoming impossible. And so, one Sunday afternoon, the administrators of her nursing home in Hickory, N.C., asked Mrs. Mull's daughter what to do: Did she want a feeding tube inserted? At that point, Mrs. Mull muttered only a few random words and could no longer recognize her daughter. The feeding tube would almost certainly prolong her life, but was it worth it? The question of how aggressive to be in treating late-stage Alzheimer's patients is one of the most wrenching and contentious issues in medicine. For every patient who, like Mrs. Mull, reaches the final stage of the disease, there typically are about five or six family members faced with decisions about whether to authorize medical treatments for patients whose bodies live on though their minds are gone.
The next question was, What does this gene do? The researchers discovered that it directs cells to make a protein that is in membranes and helps move nutrients into cells. The protein is concentrated in places where nutrients are absorbed and utilized. ''It looks like it is important for generating energy and storing it,'' Dr. Helfand said. But why would slightly disabling the gene extend the life span? ''What we think is happening -- we haven't proven it -- is that we inadvertently created the effect of caloric restriction genetically,'' Dr. Helfand said. Eventually, Dr. Helfand said, scientists might be able to create a drug to mimic the action of the altered gene. If so, said Dr. Steven Austad, a zoologist at the University of Iowa who studies aging in rodents and birds, ''this is the most exciting thing.'' He explained, ''People have been trying to take the hundreds of effects of caloric restriction and trying to figure out what to look at.'' For example, he said, restricting calories decreases estrogen and testosterone production, it increases the levels of stress hormones, it increases the production of a class of stress-related proteins called heat shock proteins, and it slows the rate of cell turnover. The discovery of this single altered gene, Dr. Austad said, ''gives us something quite specific that we can look at quite easily.''
Dr. Schuelke cited one concern: Muscle cells are surrounded by immature satellite cells that lie dormant until the muscle is injured. Then they migrate into the muscle, replacing injured or dead cells. A recent paper indicated that myostatin might normally function to keep satellite cells quiescent. Without myostatin, he said, the satellite cells might be so active building muscle that they become depleted early in life. For now, the little boy is healthy and very strong, able to hold two 6.6-pound weights horizontally with his arms extended. But while the muscles in his arms and legs are twice as big as the muscles of other children his age, Dr. Schuelke said, ''he is not extreme: you wouldn't recognize him if you saw him on the street.'' The question is, What will happen when he grows older? Will he be an athlete, a bodybuilder? Or will his satellite cells be used up so that his muscles start to deflate when he is 30 or so?
Huge clinical trials involving thousands of arthritis patients -- the principal intended users of the new drugs -- showed that the drugs performed as expected. They were as effective in relieving inflammation as aspirin and the other nonsteroidal anti-inflammmatory drugs available over the counter. And the incidence of stomach ulcers and their complications plummeted. But a few years ago, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, a University of Pennsylvania scientist, raised a theoretical question: can cox-2 inhibitors shift a biochemical balance so that blood will be more likely to clot? If so, patients taking cox-2 inhibitors may be at greater risk for heart attacks and strokes. As a consequence, said Dr. Edward Scolnick, the president of Merck Research Laboratories, the company decided to look specifically for excess heart attacks and strokes in a new study it was designing. The study, known as Vigor, involved 8,000 rheumatoid arthritis patients who were randomly assigned to take Vioxx or naproxen. Its main objective was to look for gastrointestinal side effects. It found that patients taking Vioxx had less than half the incidence of these disorders -- 2.09 percent had the complications, compared with 4.49 percent of patients taking naproxen.
''It would be morally indefensible,'' said Dr. Brigid Hogan, a professor of cell biology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville and an investigator with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. Dr. Jaenisch said, ''It would be reckless and irresponsible,'' adding, ''What do you do with humans who are born with half a kidney or no immune system?'' And, he said, what about the possibility of creating children who appear to be normal but whose genes for neurological development work improperly? Scientists say they see what appear to be genetic problems almost every time they try to clone. For example, some mouse clones grow fat, sometimes enormously obese, even though they are given exactly the same amount of food as otherwise identical mice that are not the products of cloning. The fat mice seem fine until an age that would be the equivalent of 30 for a person, when their weight starts to soar, said Dr. Ryuzo Yanagimachi, a University of Hawaii researcher who first cloned these animals and has studied cloning's consequences in them.
But, Dr. Garcia said, ''this CT machine in an emergency room could take a picture and very quickly tell'' whether the pain is from a blocked artery, or not. He added: ''That's a phenomenal potential. I am convinced it will change the practice of medicine.'' Dr. Garcia's colleague, Dr. Steven Nissen, head of clinical cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, has a very different opinion. ''To me, it's a nightmare waiting to happen,'' said Dr. Nissen, who is calling for strict guidelines overseeing use of the new machines. ''I am concerned that it is going to be difficult to control and it could bust the health care system in terms of cost.'' It is, medical experts agree, an extraordinary time in cardiology. Depending on which way the scanning market goes, the nation could save a fortune on diagnostic tests, and medical care could be improved. Or expenses could soar and patients could be harmed. The question is, how, if at all, can the technology be controlled?
Their initial study led the researchers to focus on 70 genes that they identified in a small study. The study indicated that the genes' activity appeared to predict prognosis, but that needed confirmation. So they began the new study involving 295 consecutive patients at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. The women, aged 52 and younger when their cancers were diagnosed, had had standard treatments from 1984 to 1995. Doctors had stored tissue from the women's tumors. They knew which tumors had spread to the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. They also knew whether a woman's cancer spread throughout her body or whether she remained cancer-free after her initial treatment. And they knew who had died of breast cancer within a decade of diagnosis. ''We asked whether the gene signature would be able to predict disease outcome in these patients,'' Dr. Bernards said. ''The answer is very clear. It is so powerful that it is better than any of the known criteria used today in deciding if patients need further therapy.''
The harsh truth about the status of the frozen embryos ''changes the debate,'' said Dr. Thomas Pool, scientific director of the Fertility Center of San Antonio. If the embryos already existed, were unwanted byproducts of in vitro fertilization, and were never going to be used to make babies, Dr. Pool said, people could ask, ''Could I save them and do some good with them?'' That was ''a warm and fuzzy way for people to get around the question of making them,'' he added. ''It's an easy way to not have to come back to the salient question: What are these things that we make in I.V.F. labs?'' This conundrum does not arise in the area where President Bush has proposed allowing federally financed research. He would permit work to go ahead on existing lines of stem cells -- Mr. Bush says there are 60 lines, while others say there may be as few as a dozen usable ones.
He added, ''If I were a woman and in need of an abortion, I would go for the three-minute surgery rather than the two- week medical abortion.'' So far, he said, his clinic has done 207 medical abortions since the pill became available and about 8,000 surgical procedures. Abortion providers said they know of no doctors in private practice who are offering the pill. One of the few who does, Dr. Linda Prine, a family practice doctor in New York, said doctors worried about malpractice coverage and reimbursement by health insurers. ''Even physicians who want to use it are facing obstacles,'' she said. Another reason doctors in private practice hesitate, Dr. Ramos said, is the requirements that must be met. Doctors must be able to be sure that a pregnant women does not have an ectopic pregnancy, in which the fetus is lodged in a fallopian tube rather than the uterus, and they must be trained to use Mifeprex. They need to have backup surgical services available in case the medical abortion fails. Such requirements, Dr. Ramos said, limit the drug's appeal to doctors in private practice. ''To my knowledge, no private doctors in the area are offering it,'' he said.
Ms. Goodman visited the labs only a few times in the late winter of 2001 and early spring of 2002, ''an afternoon here and there over a few months,'' she said. ''I was trying really hard to make the most of whatever time I had there.'' She kept detailed notes, printing names and dimensions of equipment in a notebook, drawing little pictures of what a mouse's cage looked like, where the water bottle was, noting what was on the bottom of the cage and what the food smelled like -- ''slightly fermented granola just going bad.'' She asked how the scientists punched holes in the animals' ears to attach tags that identified them. She jotted down that the mice had ''tiny pink toes.'' She watched an autopsy of a female mouse and noticed that female mice have rows of mammary glands that go up to their chins. She noticed that when mice are anesthetized their bodies go limp but their ears are erect. She drew a picture. And she drew a map: 36 cages on a rack, 300 mice in the room.
Renee Chelian was worried about her business. With competitors charging lower prices, she needed something special to draw customers. So she created an almost a spa-like atmosphere at her offices, with low light in the rooms, aromatherapy, candles and relaxing music. Ms. Chelian runs three abortion clinics in the Detroit suburbs, where competition is so fierce that each clinic owner is looking for an edge. In Detroit, and in other large metropolitan areas around the country, there are not too few abortion providers, as abortion proponents have lamented for years. There are too many. It is still true that fewer hospitals are providing abortions, fewer doctors outside abortion clinics are offering the procedure and 86 percent of counties in the country have no abortion provider. But, over the past few years, as the number of abortions has declined, abortions increasingly have been concentrated in specialty clinics in cities and pockets of competition have developed.
''One of the main diagnostic features is the deposit of this insoluble material in the brain,'' said Dr. Eliezer Masliah, a professor of neurosciences and pathology at the University of California at San Diego. ''This gunk accumulates in the brain in very specific regions where memory and functions like them happen, like in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus where memories are recorded.'' For years, he added, people thought this material was the main problem in Alzheimer's. But, in 1989, he and Dr. Robert Terry, who was chief of the laboratory there, noticed a problem with the plaque hypothesis. They had brains from people who had been severely demented and those with only mild memory impairment. They expected to see many more plaques in those with severe dementia. They did not. In fact, they found no tight link between plaque levels and the degree of dementia. ''We were quite surprised,'' Dr. Masliah said. The idea that plaque caused dementia ''had been such a dominating force for so many years.''
While Mr. Nace says he shudders to think that Bendectin may return, obstetricians say they welcome it. Dr. Charles Lockwood, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at New York University School of Medicine, said he had seen large numbers of pregnant women whose lives were made miserable by nausea and vomiting. ''We try all sorts of different remedies,'' Dr. Lockwood said. ''We've literally tried everything from acupuncture bands, which don't seem to work, to fairly aggressive medications that are psychoactive.'' For example, Dr. Lockwood said, he sometimes prescribed Reglan, a drug that controls nausea but also makes women drowsy. ''The amount you have to give to have an effect tends to make them sleepy all day long,'' he said. Dr. Scialli said one of his pregnant patients recently got Bendectin from Canada because she was afraid to take other drugs whose safety in pregnancy had not been as well studied.
Dr. Ginger Constantine, a Wyeth vice president, said that since the drug also slows bone loss that occurs at menopause, there could be an increase in osteoporosis if women stop hormone therapy. ''The reaction to a new scientific finding is really in proportion to the dogma it is upending,'' said Dr. Elias Zerhouni, the director of the National Institutes of Health. ''We had a strong dogma'' about hormone therapy, he added, so it should perhaps be expected that the reaction was swift and heated. Some proposed that other menopause treatments be examined in studies as large and as rigorous as the Women's Health Initiative. ''We would love to think we could do more of those kinds of studies,'' Dr. Vivian Pinn, who directs the Office of Research on Women's Health at the National Institutes of Health, said. ''But can we really justify spending the kind of money we spent on the Women's Health Initiative to study other preparations?''
The death rates from cardiovascular diseases have plummeted by 60 percent since 1950, a Federal agency is announcing today, making advances against this leading killer of Americans one of the major public health achievements of the 20th century. It has been known for years that death rates from heart attacks and strokes have been falling. But this report, in summarizing the trends over a century, sharply illustrates what has been accomplished, health experts said. In today's issue of Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said that the number of deaths from strokes had steadily declined since the beginning of the century while those from heart disease peaked in the 1960's and had  been falling ever since. For example, if the death rate from heart attacks in 1963 had been repeated in subsequent years, an additional 621,000 Americans would have died in 1996 alone, the report said. The decline in the death rate has continued throughout the 1990's.
To those who ask what is wrong with simply doing every available screening test, Dr. Fost tells what happened with PKU, the first genetic screening test for newborns. Today every state tests for PKU, or phenylketonuria, and it is widely acknowledged as the perfect example of screening that saves lives and prevents disability. But Dr. Fost says that a few decades ago, the situation was not nearly so rosy. The disease, affecting one in 14,000 babies, or about 300 each year, involves a missing or defective enzyme that metabolizes the amino acid phenylalanine. Untreated, it leads to mental retardation and neurological damage. But a special diet low in phenylalanine can prevent those consequences. PKU and its cause were understood by the 1950's, but little could be done. By the time anyone knew there was a problem, the baby was several weeks old and the damage was done. In 1959, Dr. Robert Guthrie, a microbiologist at the University of Buffalo whose niece had PKU and who was passionate about stamping it out, developed a simple blood test for the condition. Then he began to lobby and soon every state had a law mandating that newborns be tested for PKU.
Before Dolly's debut in 1997, scientists thought mammals could not be cloned. But now they have cloned not only sheep but also mice, cows, pigs and goats. With mice, they have even made clones of clones on down for six generations. Dolly is apparently normal. Two infertility specialists recently announced that they wanted to clone humans. Initial fears -- that clones would age rapidly or develop cancer -- turned out to be unfounded, scientists said. But as scientists gained more experience, and tried to discern why efforts so often ended in failure, new questions about the safety of cloning arose. Fewer than 3 percent of all cloning efforts succeed. In cloning, scientists slip a cell from an adult into an egg with its genetic material removed. The egg then reprograms the adult cell's genes so that they are ready to direct the development of an embryo, then a fetus, then a newborn that is genetically identical to the adult whose cell was used to start the process. No one knows how the egg reprograms an adult cell's genes, but that, scientists think, is the source of the cloning calamities that can occur. The problem, they say, seems to be that an egg must do a task in minutes or hours that normally takes months or years. In the months it takes sperm to mature, their genes are being reprogrammed. The same thing happens in eggs, where over years they slowly mature in the ovaries. And this reprogramming must be perfect, scientists say, or individual genes can go amiss at any time in development or later life.
Dr. Elizabeth McNally of the University of Chicago, who wrote a commentary that accompanied Dr. Schuelke's paper, is hopeful. In mice with muscular dystrophy, blocking myostatin helped overcome muscle wasting, she said. There is also the potential to help people who have muscle loss from normal aging or from cancer and diseases like those of the lung or kidneys. In the future, people may be able to have their myostatin genes tested to decide whether to train to become professional athletes. ''Although the ethics of using such genetic information is questionable,'' Dr. McNally wrote, ''the feasibility of identifying this information should not be doubted.'' In addition, myostatin blockers could be used as performance enhancers. ''Myostatin blockade,'' Dr. McNally wrote, ''will probably work its way into professional and amateur athletics, as well as into the ever-growing business of physical enhancement.'' But, researchers say, it is too soon to know if such drugs would be safe. While the mice and cattle seem normal, said Dr. George Vlasuk of Wyeth Research in Cambridge, Mass., ''the long-term effects of inhibiting this molecule aren't known.''
He added, though, that other scientists had questioned the Air Force findings and methods. A major criticism of the Air Force study, Dr. Michalek said, has been that it is hard to sort out a dioxin effect from an effect of simply being overweight. Dioxin is stored in fat, so the fatter a person is, the higher his dioxin levels are likely to be. But the fatter someone is, the more likely he is to develop diabetes. The question scientists asked was, is the effect due to dioxin or to obesity? ''We know diabetes is highly related to body fat, and so is dioxin,'' Dr. Michalek said. ''That's why these diabetes findings are so difficult to interpret. People are concerned that we haven't done the right body fat adjustment.'' Dr. Michalek said he and his colleagues first started seeing a link between Agent Orange and diabetes in 1991. Though ''the findings were met with criticism in the scientific community,'' he said, Air Force researchers have continued to see the effect, even after searching assiduously for other factors that might have explained it away.
For anyone who might harbor a thought that frailty is inevitable with age, there is the abundantly robust exception of Jack LaLanne. Most middle-aged Americans know him; he was a body builder and athlete who starred in a nationally televised exercise program from 1958 to 1985. As he aged, he continued to show up periodically in the news with astonishing feats of strength and endurance. When Mr. LaLanne was 42, he did 1,033 push-ups in 23 minutes on live television. When he was 61, more than a quarter century ago, he swam the length of the Golden Gate Bridge underwater, towing a 1,000-pound boat behind him. On the day he turned 70, he towed 70 boats, each with a passenger on board, a mile and a half through Long Beach Harbor. Some passengers, his wife, Elaine, said, weighed as much as 250 pounds. Now, at 88, he says he's as vigorous as ever and attributes his strength and energy to a lifetime of attention to his diet and a lifetime of awe-inspiring exercise.
In South Korea, Dr. Moon said in a telephone interview, there was no advertising for egg donors and no payments. The 16 women who donated the 242 eggs were ''personal contacts,'' he said, declining to elaborate. The Koreans are to discuss their findings today in Seattle, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. The investigators selected 176 eggs that were in a developmental stage that made success seem most likely. To start the cloning, the team removed the genetic material from the eggs and replaced it with genetic material obtained from cumulus cells, the adult cells that cling to eggs. Cloning experiments with mice had indicated that the cells were especially amenable to the process. Dr. Moon explained, ''The cumulus cell is easy to get,'' because it is on the surface of the egg. The abundance of eggs enabled the scientists to experiment with ways of having the egg cells start to divide and of growing the embryos in the laboratory.
Instantly, a market was born. ''All the hucksters jumped on that,'' Dr. Hoberman said. By 1918, Dr. Leo L. Stanley, the prison doctor at San Quentin, was transplanting testicles from executed prisoners into healthy ones, asserting that the treatment restored health and potency. Soon, Dr. Stanley was substituting testicles from rams, goats and deer, and contending they were just as effective. Hundreds of patients sought him out. His papers appeared in the prestigious journal Endocrinology. By 1935, scientists had isolated testosterone itself. ''From that point on, you have the real thing,'' Dr. Hoberman said. It was the start of a new era, with doctors giving testosterone to women to treat breast cancer, to athletes to increase their muscle mass, to homosexuals to ''cure'' their sexual orientation, to trauma patients to increase their blood cell production and to healthy men to counteract aging. On April 15, 1939, The Journal of the American Medical Association published a paper called ''The Male Climacteric.'' The recommended treatment was testosterone therapy. ''Testosterone had just come on the market,'' Dr. Hoberman said. ''You tell me if it was an accident that we suddenly had a male menopause.''
IN 1996, Rakesh Vohra, a professor at Northwestern University, and his colleague Dean Foster published ''A Randomized Rule for Selecting Forecasts,'' a paper in the journal Operations Research. It illustrated how a random investor could outperform a group of professional stock pickers simply by following a ''buy and hold'' investment strategy. It was important research, the authors believed, until they learned that the same discovery had been made at least 16 times since the 1950's. And no one,  Dr. Vohra said, ever realized they were not doing original work. The discovery that your discovery has already been discovered is surprisingly common, said Stephen Stigler, a statistician at the University of Chicago who has written about the phenomenon. Not only does it occur in every scientific field, he said, the ''very fact of multiple discoveries has been discovered many times.'' The result of duplicative research may be no more serious than chagrin over wasted time. But in other cases, say those involving medical research, there can be a real risk of harm to patients.
Eventually, he and his wife devised a plan: he'd park their car in front of the store, she'd run in to buy the diapers, and, if she knew anyone, she would say the diapers were for their dog. Gradually, the professor got better and now just uses pads, two a day. Impotence, too, was a problem. But the professor has hope. ''I had an occasion, it was very promising,'' he said. ''It came upon me of an instance in the shower. I realized there was a stirring down there, so I encouraged that stirring. Even though I realized it was not a full erection, it was enough that I was able to achieve a kind of pleasure.'' He told his doctor. It was eight weeks since the operation. The doctor ''said it was a very very promising sign.'' The professor added, ''The general feeling is that I'm on the road, and with a little bit of help from Viagra, I would be able to return to function.''
It was not the typical scientific meeting. At least half the people in the room wore runners' watches on their wrists and running shoes on their feet. The meeting adjourned for 2 1/2 hours in the late afternoon so the participants could go for a run and eat dinner. And it seemed that no training tip was too minor to be of interest. The overwhelming challenge, the group agreed, was to run well in high heat and humidity. Dr. Martin, analyzing performance records for men, calculated that the optimum temperature for a fast marathon was about 54 degrees. Running times, he said, slow by one minute or more with every seven degrees above that, because it becomes more difficult for the body to cool itself. When it is humid, sweat does not easily evaporate, so the body sweats even more. Blood volume drops, and the body has to make a choice: divert blood to the skin for cooling or divert it to the muscles for performance. It sends blood to the skin.
Dr. Kozarek and his colleagues put the device through a rigorous test, contaminating it with spores from the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, among the most difficult organisms to kill. ''We found organisms too numerous to count throughout the device,'' Dr. Kozarek said. But after he cleaned it and sterilized it, they were gone. The investigators also asked if the device still functioned and found that it did. ''The long and short of it was that it was reusable for up to 10 times and we didn't test it more than 10 times,'' said Dr. Kozarek, who published his results in the American Journal of Gastroenterology in May 1998. Dr. Kozarek also tested sphincterotomes, which are used to cut open abnormal sphincter muscles in the bile duct. His group again found that the devices could safely be cleaned, sterilized, and reused, publishing their data in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy in 1997. Dr. Kozarek's group began reprocessing the devices and, among 1,000 patients treated, found two who had become infected. They checked, fearing the infections had arisen from improperly sterilized devices. But ''they were brand-new devices,'' Dr. Kozarek said. The infections turned out to be unrelated to the devices.
Dr. Antman has a message for patients: With a disease as serious as heart disease, those who take responsibility are often the ones who survive. Having a heart attack, even if it turns out well, as his did, is a life-altering experience, Mr. Orr said. His first heart attack, Mr. Orr said, ''came out of the blue.'' When he was discharged from the hospital, he was terrified that it would happen again when he was alone and unable to call for help. ''I had a really hard time with it,'' he said. ''I only stayed in my own house for one night and then I moved to a friend's house for two weeks.'' Now Mr. Orr plans to be serious about taking his medication and getting back to his diet and exercise program. He will call an ambulance if he ever has symptoms again. Still, he hates to think of himself as a patient. ''I'm a little freaked out that I will have to take medication for the foreseeable eternity,'' Mr. Orr said.
Then the scientists tried to use those sperm to fertilize eggs, asking whether the added jellyfish genes became part of the developing embryos. The gene encodes instructions for a protein that gives jellyfish a green glow. If it got into the monkey embryos and functioned, the embryo cells would glow green under a fluorescent light. In one set of experiments, the scientists fertilized about 20 monkey eggs in vitro, mixing sperm and eggs in a petri dish. With that method, which mimics natural fertilization, the sperm swims to the egg and discards its protein coat as it enters. The extra gene was discarded with the coat as the sperm penetrated the egg. Only the sperm's genetic material got in. The scientists also fertilized 81 eggs by directly injecting them with the gene-containing sperm. Then, they report, the jellyfish genes entered the eggs with the sperm. The consequence was clear when the scientists shined a fluorescent light on the embryos. ''More than a third of the embryos fluoresced,'' Dr. Schatten said.
Dr. Kusiak said 9 in 10 doctors cited relief of such symptoms as a reason they prescribed the drugs. ''For the longer term, particularly beyond the four-year point, we would advise that it has to be an individualized risk-benefit analysis,'' she said. Dr. Deborah Grady, who directs the University of California at San Francisco/Mount Zion Women's Health Clinical Research Center, said she would urge most women taking the hormone combination to stop. ''This is a dangerous drug,'' Dr. Grady said. Many women, she said, can simply stop cold. If there is no return of menopausal symptoms, then great, she said, but if the symptoms return and are intolerable, the woman can take the hormones for another year and then try again to stop. But, Dr. Grady said, if a woman has taken the hormones for four or more years, the time when her risk of breast cancer emerges, she should try harder, tapering her hormone dose until she can do without them.
Military medical experts said the hope, with all of these new products, is that they will keep the wounded alive until they can see a surgeon. Surgeons will be using a method pioneered a decade ago in trauma centers in cities reeling from an epidemic of drug-fueled violence. One of its leading innovators was Dr. C. William Schwab, a trauma surgeon at the University of Pennsylvania, who was troubled by the number of patients treated there who died later. ''We started to see that even though we would get the injury controlled and fixed, even though we put them back together, they would die,'' Dr. Schwab said. Patients would go into shock, their temperatures would drop, their blood would become acidic and coagulate, forming fatal clots. Dr. Schwab decided to try doing the absolute minimum surgically to stop the bleeding, so doctors could turn their attention to stabilizing the patients. Later, he reasoned, surgeons would complete their repair.
''This is a profoundly important report,'' Dr. Mulshine said. ''It is a remarkable result.'' Members of an advocacy group for lung cancer patients, the Lung Cancer Alliance, agreed. ''This is the most important breakthrough for the lung cancer community,'' Laurie Fenton, the group's president, said in a news release. And, says Dr. Henschke's colleague Dr. David Yankelevitz, it makes sense that early detection can save lives. Lung cancer screening is analogous to screening for breast cancer, Dr. Yankelevitz said. In both situations, he added, ''treatment is easier and the outcomes are better when the tumor is small.'' But mammograms are endorsed by many national groups, whereas lung cancer screening is not. And while praising the new study's careful accumulation of data, representatives of groups like the American Cancer Society, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, say the study is unlikely to persuade them to recommend screening as a public policy.
The Black Market  Illegal to Sell, But Easy to Find Cy Willson wanted testosterone, and he wanted his health insurer to pay for it -- the pure drug, produced for human and not veterinary use, could cost $20 a month for the dose he wanted. So he needed a prescription. But the only approved use is for people with demonstrated testosterone deficiencies. So Mr. Willson, a 21-year-old student at a large Midwestern university, set out to give himself a deficiency. In the April 2001 issue of Testosterone magazine, in an article titled ''Your Doctor, Your Dealer,'' he explained how he did it -- what symptoms to feign, what to eat (very little, and no carbohydrates or fat), what to drink (beer) and whether to exercise (yes, twice a day). A little sleep deprivation also helps, he wrote. Mr. Willson says his testosterone levels plummeted and he got his prescription. He says he is taking testosterone ''for aesthetic purposes,'' explaining that he gained 20 pounds of muscle.
''I like the fact that we help people who are poor,'' Dr. Pardes said. But, he said, the financial pressures on his hospital are so great that ''the last thing we want is to get a reputation as the place to go for somebody who's poor.'' He recently got a call from a friend at another hospital who had a poor, uninsured patient who needed an expensive treatment. Dr. Pardes's friend said his hospital could not afford to do it. Could New York-Presbyterian take it on? Dr. Pardes' staff members advised him to say no, that they already were accepting too many charity cases. ''I'm left as the final decision maker,'' Dr. Pardes said. ''I told them to do it. Then I put the phone down and I started to cry.'' ''It is a real ethical and personal dilemma for me,'' Dr. Pardes said. Kenneth E. Thorpe, the chairman of the department of health policy and management at Emory University's School of Public Health, said he thought he knew about health care prices and the differences between what could be negotiated and what individuals might be charged.
''We were very moved by the testimony we heard,'' Dr. Ernster said. ''But it does not appear that the implants were the cause of the systemic illnesses.'' Asked if another group of equally qualified and objective scientists could look at the same data and come to a different conclusion, Dr. Bondurant said, ''No, I can't imagine that.''
The clinical signs of Alzheimer's disease are all too familiar -- the erosion of memory for recent, then distant events, the declining ability to reason or to think. Eventually, there is the blank look, a sort of Alzheimer's stare, and a failure to recognize a husband, a wife, a child. But the real question has been, What is going on in the brain, and why do patients suffer the terrible forgetfulness? For years, the prevailing notion was that Alzheimer's was a disease of brain-cell death. Pathologists could see that progressively, relentlessly, brain cells died, leaving behind piles of debris that they detected in autopsies and that are the hallmarks of the disease. But now, many researchers are asking if that old hypothesis is correct. They cite accumulating evidence that memory starts to fail long before brain cells die, and that the disease, with its memory loss, begins as an interruption of the signaling between living and healthy brain cells.
Dr. Valentin Fuster, a cardiologist at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and a past president of the American Heart Association, noted that this aspect of the guidelines was a pronounced change. ''You are targeting a population that has never had a heart attack,'' Dr. Fuster said. Those people used to be handed a diet to start and given more modest goals for cholesterol reduction. Now, he said, the guidelines told doctors to ''go in aggressively, as aggressively as in patients who already had heart disease.'' Another change was in how to treat people who have had a heart attack, said Dr. Michael Lauer, who directs clinical research in cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation and is a co-author of an editorial accompanying the guidelines in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Heart-attack patients with high cholesterol levels used to be put on a diet. After several months they would have their cholesterol re-checked, Dr. Lauer said.
To produce a clone, scientists slip the genetic material from a patient's cell into an unfertilized egg from another person whose genetic material has been removed. The genes from the patient's cell take over, directing the egg to divide and develop into an embryo that is genetically identical to the patient. About five days later, when the cloned embryo contains about 100 cells and is about 0.08 inch in diameter, it changes its form, looking like a ball of cells encased in a sphere. That ball of cells, when removed and grown in the laboratory, becomes the embryonic stem cells. The process, however, fails more often than it succeeds, and, in humans, it seemed to fail almost all the time. In a previous report, published last February, Dr. Hwang and Dr. Moon used 248 human eggs to produce a single embryonic stem cell line, a group of cells that came from one embryonic cell and could grow on a petri dish.
Despite an assiduous search, scientists have found only a half-dozen people in the world who make no leptin. These people eat voraciously -- one 3-year-old girl consumed 2,000 calories at a sitting. When several of these people were treated with leptin, they lost their appetites and their weight plummeted. Now some experts suggest that the hormone's role is to signal the brain that there is fat on the body. Animals and people who lack the hormone get no such signal and they eat continuously. It makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint that leptin would serve to signal the brain that there is fat on the body rather than signal the body to get rid of fat, said Dr. Jeffrey S. Flier, the chief of endocrinology at the Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston. ''Evolution would favor people who could get obese when they have an opportunity to eat,'' he said. ''Starvation is so much more of a threat to survival than obesity that it is reasonable to propose that the role of leptin is as a switch to tell the brain that you are in danger from food restriction or that you are okay.''
It is not known how many patients have had the surgery, which came into use in the early 1990's. In 1996, a government survey showed that more than 3,000 had had the operation at 27 medical centers. There are no national records of how many operations have been done since. The new results are from 140 patients out of 1,033 who have enrolled in the federal study and had their treatment assigned at random, either surgery or medical treatment.  The 140 patients, whose average age was 60, were so sick that their ability to force air out of their lungs was no more than 20 percent of normal, and they had extensive lung damage. Such severe illness means that a person might be able to walk around a room, but could not walk half a block. Almost all needed supplemental oxygen. Sixty-nine of the 140 patients had the operation but had no improvement in their quality of life. Sixteen percent died in the month after the operation, as compared with no deaths among study participants who were just as ill but did not have the operation.
Dr. Hrobjartsson said he had been telling other investigators what he found and watching their responses. ''People react with surprise, but also with a kind of satisfaction,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''They start reflecting.'' Experts interviewed this week had a range of responses from ready acceptance of the conclusion to great surprise to a skepticism and the desire to see the details of the analysis. Dr. Donald Berry, for example, a statistician at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said: ''I believe it. In fact, I have long believed that the placebo effect is nothing more than a regression effect,'' referring to a well-known statistical observation that a patient who feels particularly terrible one day will almost invariably feel better the next day, no matter what is done for him. Another physician, Dr. Jonathan Moreno, director of the Center for the Biomedical Ethics at the University of Virginia, said it rang true to him. ''Maybe it is one of the urban legends of medicine,'' he said.
''That told me a whole lot about Alzheimer's,'' Mr. DeBaggio said. ''It's a disease you hide.''
That leaves a mystery -- if the drugs are so effective, where is the virus coming from? Along with the work on early treatment, the search for the virus's hiding places is one of the most provocative areas in the frontier of AIDS research, medical experts say. The answer to the question of where the virus hides can determine if AIDS can ever be cured. If there is a virus reservoir that can be attacked -- perhaps by surgically removing the infected tissue or finding drugs that home in on it -- maybe doctors can one day rid people of H.I.V. for good. But if the reservoir is inaccessible, a cure may not be possible. Dr. Siliciano, for one, holds out little hope of eradicating the H.I.V. reservoir, even if a person is treated early. People like Bob Massey or Jim H., he says, are like people who have had chickenpox. The virus is still there -- just hiding -- and their immune system keeps it in check. In the case of chickenpox, the virus hides for a lifetime in nerve cells, tamped down by the immune system when it tries to re-emerge.
For that reason, he said, he is not confident in the study's conclusion that mammography led to a lower breast cancer death rate. Dr. Freedman said he was confident in the data because of the study's setup. One reason, he said, is that Mr. Shapiro made a correction to try to make the two groups of women equivalent. If breast cancer was diagnosed, the researchers would examine the patient's records and if they discovered that she had had breast cancer before the study began, they dropped her from the study. In the end, Dr. Freedman said, about equal numbers of women in the two groups who were kept in the study developed breast cancer. That, he says, tells him that the two groups were not so different. Dr. Berry said he was not at all comforted by Dr. Freedman's arguments. ''Any bias associated with the women who had been excluded at the start of the study cannot be repaired retrospectively by guessing whether someone had cancer at the time of randomization,'' he said. In fact, he added, it can make a bias worse.
But, they say, clinical research is different from medical therapy; its aim is not to help those in the study but to help future patients. To be ethical, they say, a study with placebo surgery must meet three criteria: it must not place patients at undue risk; the benefits of learning whether the surgery works must be worth any potential risk to the patients; and the patients must give informed consent. In the current case, they wrote, all those objectives were met and the study ''exemplifies the ethically justified use of placebo surgery.'' In the second editorial, Dr. David T. Felson of Boston University and Dr. Joseph Buckwalter of the University of Iowa note that if there were large beneficial effects from the surgery, the study should have found them. ''Although the study may not have been large enough to permit the detection of any small effects,'' they wrote, ''the data presented do not suggest that there were any.,''
Ms. Buchanan said that sort of care made all the difference for her. After learning she had cancer, she decided to have both breasts removed. She had a strong family history of breast cancer and was terrified that she might get cancer in her other breast. And she decided to have breast reconstruction at the same time as her mastectomies. Dr. Dultz and Dr. Marc Alan Drimmer, a Princeton plastic surgeon, did the operation. ''When I woke up after the surgery, she was holding my left hand and he was holding my right hand,'' Ms. Buchanan said. ''When I think about it, it makes me want to cry.''
The practice of reusing devices that are approved only for one-time use is not necessarily dangerous, experts say, but it generally violates federal regulations. So far, the government has declined to ask the companies that reprocess the devices to submit evidence that they are safe and effective but under pressure from device makers it is now reconsidering its approach. ''We have used what we call enforcement discretion not to go after them,'' said Dr. Larry Kessler, who is director of the office of surveillance and biometrics at the Food and Drug Administration. One reason is that the agency has little evidence of a safety problem, Dr. Kessler said, although everyone admits that research is urgently needed. ''There's a big yuck factor to reusing devices,'' Dr. Kessler said. But he added that ''there are no products where we have significant evidence that there is immediate harm to public health.'' Some doctors and federal officials say the issue is more about economics than safety. Device makers make less money when  single-use devices are cleaned, sterilized and used again.
''With mammography, we have multiple studies showing what happens to mortality rates if you get this versus if you don't,'' Dr. Fletcher said. ''With these newer technologies, we don't.'' The new study of computer-aided detection was an analysis of 429,345 mammograms obtained from 1998 to 2002 at 43 mammography centers. During that time, seven of the centers switched to computer-aided detection. That enabled the investigators to compare results with and without computer software to help radiologists find suspicious spots. Computer-aided detection, the researchers wrote, ''was associated with significantly higher false positive rates, recall rates, and biopsy rates and with significantly lower overall accuracy.'' With computer-aided detection, 31 percent more women were called in for additional tests and 20 percent more had biopsies. And there was another potential problem: CAD did not clearly increase the detection of breast cancer. If anything, it seemed to increase the detection of a precancerous condition, D.C.I.S., for ductal carcinoma in situ.
The heaviest users of hormone therapy were women in affluent places like Marin County, where high breast cancer rates had long troubled women and researchers. Women in those areas also largely abandoned the treatments after the 2002 report and their cancer rates declined accordingly, Dr. Clarke said. Dr. Marcia Stefanick, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and chairwoman of the steering committee for the Women's Health Initiative, said she found the hormone argument persuasive and felt it helped clear up the mystery in Marin County. ''Everyone kept saying, What is it? What's in the environment?'' she said. Now, she said, it is becoming clear. ''The best explanation is hormone therapy.''
But, she said, she will not return to her old ways when the county's grant ends this year and will accept less income if she has to. ''We made the culture change and there's no going back,'' Dr. Safford said. ''It changes everything. I look at this as a wonderful blessing.''
The information provided by advocacy groups is blunt. Y-Me states that breast cancer is ''the overall leading cause of death in women between the ages of 40 and 55.'' It adds: ''In the United States, 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer in her lifetime. This year, breast cancer will be newly diagnosed every three minutes and a woman will die of breast cancer every 13 minutes.'' CapCure, the organization founded by Michael Milken to fight prostate cancer, states similar statistics: ''In 2002, an estimated 189,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer. This represents one new case every three minutes.'' While the figures are accurate, some medical researchers are concerned by the messages they convey. Such statements, they say, may lead people to exaggerate their chances of getting and dying from a fearsome disease. In an effort to provide another way to look at cancer and other disease risks, three investigators published charts in the June 5 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, showing how cancer compares with other causes of death at various ages. The result, medical investigators say, shows how the same numbers presented in different ways can have very different emotional tones and gives a glimpse at the slippery nature of human perceptions of risk.
But history shows that developing even seemingly straightforward treatments can take many years, and many detours. In the early 1970's, scientists started talking about making ''magic bullets'' to treat cancer, hooking toxins to monoclonal antibodies and creating a sort of smart bomb that would zoom in on tumors and kill them. But it proved harder than most expected to find a therapy that worked. The first such drug, Mylotarg, made by Wyeth, was approved in 2000, for acute myelogenous leukemia, a rare but deadly form of the disease. Research leading to that drug began in 1981. And therapeutic cloning is far more complicated and the science far less understood. ''It's definitely a baby field,'' said Dr. Denise Faustman, an associate professor of medicine at the Harvard Medical School. Scientists are excited by the promise for basic science. Dr. Weissman, of Stanford, likens the discovery of cloned embryonic stem cells to that of recombinant DNA.
SKELETAL muscle, Dr. Bouchard said, burns about 13 calories per kilogram of body weight over 24 hours when a person is at rest. A typical man who weighs 70 kilograms, or 154 pounds, has about 28 kilograms of skeletal muscle. His muscles, when he is at rest, burn about 22 percent of the calories his body uses. The brain would use about the same number of calories, as would the liver, Dr. Bouchard said. If the man lifts weights and gains 2 kilograms, or 4.4 pounds of muscle, his metabolic rate would increase by 24 calories a day. Dr. Jack Wilmore, an exercise physiologist at Texas A&amp;M University, said that the average amount of muscle that men gained after lifting weights for 12 weeks was 2 kilograms, or about 4.4 pounds. Women, of course, will gain much less. A corollary to the hypothesis that you burn more calories simply by adding muscle is the belief that muscle can noticeably change your body weight. The idea is that when you do resistance training you may actually be thinner yet weigh the same or a little more, because muscle is heavier than fat.
Moreover, colonoscopy requires an uncomfortable bowel cleansing, and patients are almost always sedated for the procedure. Healthy patients need a test only once a decade. Sigmoidoscopy involves a less onerous cleansing and no sedation. But it does not show the entire colon and should be repeated every five years. Fecal occult blood testing must be repeated every year or two to be sure that polyps, which periodically ooze blood, are found. While doctors in a few places, like New York, say there are so many specialists ready to do colonoscopies that patients rarely have to wait, specialists elsewhere are overwhelmed. An alternative test, so-called virtual colonoscopy, which uses C.T. scanners to look for colon polyps, may eventually help meet the demand, medical experts say. But the procedure is still under study, and insurers do not pay for it. At the Oschner Clinic in New Orleans, the number of colonoscopies doubled in the last few years, according to Dr. David E. Beck, the clinic's chairman of colon and rectal surgery. Now, the wait is three months, even though the doctors increased their efficiency, getting one patient ready while they work on another, and began working Saturdays.
The logic has long sounded so compelling that few have questioned it: A particular protein seeps out of the prostate of a man who has prostate cancer. The more of that protein in the bloodstream, then, the worse it must be for the cancer patient. But now a group of scientists at EntreMed, a biotechnology company  in Rockville, Md., say the prostate protein -- prostate specific antigen, or P.S.A. -- may actually be used by the body to fight cancer. They say the protein appears to be an angiogenesis inhibitor, one of a class of compounds that cut off blood supplies to tumors, preventing them from growing. The researchers' report appears in today's issue of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, which published it with unusual speed, as an ''accelerated discovery,'' because it included not just test-tube evidence but also animal data pointing to a conclusion that could, if it holds up, eventually lead to important insights into the biology, screening or even  treatment of cancer, said Dr. Barnett Kramer, the journal's editor.
Some scientists theorize that Alzheimer's may result from what they term multiple hits -- someone on the edge of developing the disease may be pushed over by additional insults to the brain. The added hits could include, among other things, a stroke, high blood pressure or high cholesterol. The theory makes sense, Alzheimer's experts say, because almost any injury to the brain increases the risk of the disease, and the risk factors for cardiovascular disease, which can decrease blood flow to the brain, increase the risk for Alzheimer's. If the multiple-hit theory is correct, detecting and treating high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels early may help prevent the illness. Even if preventing Alzheimer's becomes a reality, some people will still develop it. For them, the goal is to find a way to reverse the progression, removing plaque in their brains and restoring the ability to think. No one knows how to do this. But to neurologists' amazement, they have found hints that it may be possible. The glimmer of evidence comes from failed efforts to treat Alzheimer's disease by eliciting an immune response to the beta amyloid protein in plaques.
Dr. Sulmasy, at St. Vincent's, said informed consent should be the rule. ''Most in my practice pick stool cards,'' he said, adding that he would choose that test himself when he turns 50 in three years. Not Dr. Beck, 50, who chose a colonoscopy, without sedation. It was no big deal, he said. ''You just have to go a little slower.''
Public health groups in Alaska are testing a pilot program to make emergency contraceptives available to women without requiring them to see a doctor, and groups in California and Oregon will soon put into place their own pilot programs. Earlier this month, Norway became the first country to make a similar drug, called NorLevo, available over the counter, on shelves and out in the open along with headache remedies and cold medicines. And on Thursday, the French Parliament changed its law on contraceptives to allow nurses to give NorLevo to teenage girls in schools, said Dr. Andre Ulmann, whose company, HRA-Pharma, makes NorLevo. Not only is Plan B approved in the United States as a prescription drug, but public health advocates have also gotten contraceptive pills approved in Canada and some African, Asian, and South American countries, including some, like Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela, where abortion is illegal. The new pill has the same ultimate effect as the old ''morning-after pill'' -- it uses high doses of hormones to prevent pregnancy. But the morning-after pill was never an actual product. Doctors would mix it up themselves, ripping open packets of birth control pills and telling women to take several of them -- the exact dose depended on the brand of pills. The regimen, while effective, often caused nausea and vomiting. The new pill, in contrast, is packaged, marketed and designed specifically to prevent pregnancy. It also has fewer side effects.
''She trained harder than anyone I've ever seen,'' Terry Todd said. But he added: ''No matter how hard she trained, it was a foregone conclusion that these other women were going to catch her, and they did. It's frustrating. It takes the fun out of the sport.'' One female power lifter, Tam Thompson, told Mr. Todd, in an interview he recorded on April 15, 1986, that she had begun taking drugs because she thought other women were taking them. Eventually, Ms. Thompson said, her voice deepened ''and I noticed these strange hairs showing up. I thought, 'Well, that's no big deal. A hair here, a hair there. Big deal. I can live with it.' The next cycle it got worse. But by then, I figured the damage had already been done, and I went ahead with the full cycle of steroids because I had a meet coming up.'' She added, ''I've been off the drugs almost two years now, but I still have to shave every day.''
For some common illnesses, there may be no difference in outcomes between community hospitals and academic medical centers, ones that are connected to medical schools and that serve as referral centers for patients with the most complicated, difficult cases. For heart surgery, what matters appears to be the surgeon's experience, not the number of such patients at the hospital. But for some cancers, the important factor seems to be the total number of patients with that cancer at a hospital, not the number any particular surgeon sees. Everyone agrees that medical statistics are not the only issue. People want to like and trust their doctors. And with a community hospital, patients have the convenience of staying close to home and may be more likely to receive warm, personal care. That was an important consideration for Mary Bruce Buchanan, a 60-year-old retired real estate broker from Flemington, N.J., whose decision about where to go for cancer care went against her own upbringing. Her father, a surgeon, had trained at the University of Pennsylvania and, she said, ''when anything was really wrong, that was where you went.''
The great appeal of the new stents is that they overcome a nagging problem. Ordinarily with stents, a third or more of the patients will develop scar tissue around the stent, obstructing the artery. The solution, some companies decided, would be to coat stents with drugs that staunch cell growth. Last year another company, Cordis, began marketing the first such stent, coated with the drug sirolimus. Boston Scientific, which used a different stent design and a different drug to coat it, paclitaxel, began marketing its stent in March. Some medical experts, like Dr. Renu Virmani, who directs the division of cardiovascular pathology at the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, have been collecting reports on the taxus stent. Dr. Virmani says she knows of 15 medical centers where there were documented serious incidents, including five patients who were rushed into emergency open heart surgery. Some leading cardiologists, on the other hand, said they were unaware of any reason for concern with the new stent.
''Not everyone can afford it,'' Mr. Haber said. But, he added, ''I am a person who's made a choice.'' He added that when Dr. Fenton suggests an expensive test he may go to his Aetna doctor and hope that he will recommend the same test, so it can be paid for by Aetna. ''That is not always easy,'' Mr. Haber said. In fact, he recently was turned down for a medical test by his Aetna doctor, forcing him into a decision on whether to pay for it himself. ''I will probably absorb the cost,'' Mr. Haber said. Health care economists predict that the two-tiered system may be here to stay, and that no national health care plan is going to obviate it. ''The notion that you're going to provide the same level of care for everyone,'' Professor Fuchs of Stanford said, ''means either that it's going to be enormously expensive or that it's going to be a level of care that's far below what some people are willing and able to pay for.'' But, said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, doctors with fee-for-service practices may find themselves under a new sort of competitive pressure. People who can afford such doctors also tend to be people who are comfortable using computers and the Internet, he said.
Other doctors believed in a gentler approach, reasoning that the body should be allowed to heal itself. They treated patients with rest and a mild diet, a bit of quinine and a cold bath every morning. In one of the newly discovered letters, Alexander Hamilton, who also contracted yellow fever in the epidemic, credits the treatment with saving his life. But while the College of Physicians letter is the original, its  text was well known because Hamilton sent it to Philadelphia's only newspaper at the time, The Federal Gazette and Philadelphia Advertiser, to attack Dr. Rush, who was a close friend of Hamilton's rival Thomas Jefferson, Mr. Greifenstein said. While there is still no treatment for yellow fever, it is now known that the disease is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which picks up the  virus while feeding on an infected person and transmits it to healthy people. There is a yellow fever vaccine, but the disease was eliminated in this country by wiping out the mosquito that carries it.
''People don't sit down and say: 'Here's $60,000. I want a year of life,''' he said. ''What you end up doing is to say, what's the cost of the program and how does that affect what I charge and does it help or hurt in the marketplace?'' The task force's role was a bit different, he said. ''Cost does not enter into the task force's recommendations,'' Dr. Calonge said. ''We're looking for a balance of harm to potential risk. You will have the benefit in terms of lives saved and years given back to those men.'' But for insurers, the question is a bit different, Dr. Calonge said, ''They will say, 'At what cost and can we afford this?'''
An extensive study of heart attack patients in New Jersey finds that those who arrived at hospitals on weekends were less likely to receive aggressive treatment and were slightly more likely to die than those who arrived on weekdays, researchers are reporting today. The study, based on an analysis of 231,164 heart attack patients admitted to New Jersey hospitals from 1987 to 2002, found a gap of almost 1 percentage point in heart attack death rates over one three-year span, 12.9 percent for weekend patients and 12 percent for weekday patients. The deaths occurred within a month of admission. In that period, 1999 to 2002, 10 percent of weekday patients had angioplasty to open blocked arteries on the day they were admitted, compared with 6.7 percent of weekend patients. Angioplasty within a few hours of the start of heart attacks can interrupt the attacks and save lives. The study, led by William J. Kostis, a fourth-year medical student at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J., who also has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering, is being published today in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Ms. Feldt of Planned Parenthood  said women in clinical trials said they liked mifepristone abortions because they felt more natural than surgical ones. ''They feel more in charge, more in control of their personal health,'' Ms. Feldt said. But Olivia Gans, who is the director of American Victims of Abortion at the National Right to Life Committee, said she worried that women might not understand what they were getting into when they took the drug. ''We are just seeking another way to deliberately end a life,'' she said. ''How honest are we going to be with the American public about what's at stake with this drug?'' Heather O'Neill, a Danco spokeswoman, said that the company had not yet set a price for the drug but that she expected insurance companies and government programs that now pay for surgical abortions to pay for mifepristone also. But doctors who want to use mifepristone may find that insurance questions and F.D.A. restrictions are just part of their requirements. In some states, abortion laws might restrict the drug's use. For example, many states require abortion providers to register and report every abortion. Some have detailed requirements for the design of offices and clinics. Some states require that fetal remains be examined by a doctor and in North Dakota, the remains must be cremated, incinerated, or buried, the law says.
The lesson, Dr. Weinstein says, is that ''you can have pain and still function.'' And while there may appear to be more treatments that ever, he adds, ''more isn't necessarily better.''
Dr. Flier says he is waiting for something to offer that truly works. But now, for the first time, he and others say there is real reason to hope. Obesity research seems to have entered a new phase. The excitement is in the lab and not yet in the clinic, much less in the drugstore. Nonetheless, experts agree, the field that many had dismissed as a scientific backwater has been shaken to its roots. Instead of endlessly rejiggering diets and exercise regimens, a new wave of scientists is getting at the molecular causes of appetite and satiety, unraveling elaborate chemical pathways that control how much animals, including people, eat. Some of the newly discovered molecules are thought to keep body weight stable by controlling appetite, so that someone who eats a huge meal one evening will not have a voracious appetite the next morning. Other molecules react to signals from the body that it is not fat enough, making people feel an urge to gorge on calorie-laden foods. Many scientists now believe that everyone's eating is controlled by these and other molecules that send signals between the brain and the body but that obese people are likely to have a different balance of them or are less reponsive to them.
Seppy Basili, vice president for learning and assessment at Kaplan Inc., a leading test preparation company, said there were big differences between test preparation courses. ''What we've seen over the past 15 years is this huge increase in weekend courses and one-day courses,'' Mr. Basili said. Kaplan's courses, which cost $800, last three months. ''This whole notion of grouping commercial courses with this broad brush causes a problem for us.'' He added that the company's surveys of its students showed that they increased their SAT scores by an average of 120 points. Though Mr. Briggs's study avoided many drawbacks of previous ones, it was not ideal, said Dr. James Robins, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health, who cited the fact that students were not randomly assigned to groups. As a result, Dr. Robins said, he would not be surprised if the true coaching gain was as much as 40 or 60 points -- or if it was even less than 20 points.
But still, Ms. Barton said, she often wishes she could just forget, for once, about what she is eating. ''I'd like to just live my life and not think about it,'' she said. The Fat Epidemic Previous articles in this series examined an extreme surgical treatment for weight loss, new obesity research and exercise and weight. Later articles will investigate overweight children, the psychology of eating and the diet business. The series will remain available online:  www.nytimes.com/obesity Correction:  October 19, 2000, Thursday  A front-page article yesterday about chronic dieters misspelled the surname of the director of the weight management and nutrition center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, who urged patients to have realistic goals. She is Cathy Nonas, not Monas.
Dr. David E. Martin, an exercise physiologist at Georgia State University in Atlanta, called the change revolutionary and overdue. He is a co-author of a new advisory statement on fluid replacement in marathons written for the International Marathon Medical Directors Association. It was a supporting statement for the track and field advisory. Dr. Martin said the old advice was leading to water gorging, with people stopping at every water stop, downing water cups and so diluting their blood that their sodium levels plummeted, a condition known as hyponatremia. The problem occurs in any endurance event that gives people the time to drink and drink and drink. It emerges among people who hike the Grand Canyon, in those who compete in Ironman Triathlons and, most notably, in marathons. Hyponatremia is not a problem for elite marathon runners, Dr. Martin said, because they go too fast to drink too much. ''Running at a five-minutes-per-mile pace,'' he said, ''there's no way you can drink enough to get hyponatremia.''
In one study being reported today,  investigators injected women's coronary arteries with a dye and then examined the arteries with X-rays. They found that the women's arteries gradually narrowed as the three-year study progressed, whether or not they took estrogen. Dr. David M. Herrington, a cardiovascular epidemiologist at Wake Forest University School of Medicine, the lead author of the new artery study, said he began the work in hopes of confirming the belief that  estrogen would help women with  heart disease. A study reported previously,  called HERS, had already shown discouraging results, but some researchers wondered whether the reason might be that the women in it took either a combination of estrogen and methoxyprogesterone, or a placebo. Some experts proposed that if the women took estrogen alone, the hormone would protect their hearts. So the 309 women in Dr. Herrington's study were randomly assigned to take estrogen alone, estrogen plus methoxyprogesterone, or a placebo.
Dr. Jacques E. Rossouw, who is acting director of the hormone replacement trial, said in an interview yesterday that even though it was too soon to say whether the increased risk of heart attacks and strokes would hold up as the study continued, he felt morally obliged to inform the women about the finding. ''This wasn't anticipated when they enrolled,'' Dr. Rossouw said. ''We told them all about the risks and benefits but we didn't tell them there might be an increased risk of heart disease.'' He added that he fervently hoped that the women would stay in the study and that other women would not panic because the number of women who had had heart attacks and strokes was minuscule. ''If my women friends ask me, 'How does this affect me?', my advice is it doesn't change a thing,'' Dr. Rossouw said. ''I would say there never was proof that hormones help heart disease and there still isn't. The only qualifier is, if you're expecting an early benefit from heart disease it looks less likely.''
''Lo and behold, this guy had huge helper T-cell numbers,'' Dr. Walker said. ''This was the first evidence that H.I.V. followed the rules that other viruses follow.'' It meant that the body's immune system could control H.I.V. Mr. Massey, in fact, had the AIDS virus under such exquisite control that Dr. Walker and a young doctor, Eric Rosenberg, who joined him in the research, could find no virus at all in his bloodstream. But the antibodies in his blood left no doubt that the virus had been there. Mr. Massey could hardly absorb what the doctors were telling him. ''Eric would say, 'Bob, you're the gold standard.' I couldn't quite believe that I was that important. They finally had to shake me and say, 'You're very, very unusual.' '' But was anyone else controlling the virus the way Mr. Massey was? Dr. Rosenberg started asking every doctor for patients who seemed to be controlling their H.I.V. infections without drugs. Slowly, the patients started to emerge.
For patients like Dr. Kreindel, the treadmill test, measuring how quickly his heart rate falls after he stops exercising, can help answer the question, to treat or not to treat? The test was not easy, Dr. Kreindel said. ''I felt like I was going to fall off the treadmill.'' But when he slowed down, his heart rate plummeted. ''He turned out to be low-risk,'' Dr. Lauer said. No treatment was warranted. ''People who are at high risk, the philosophy is, 'Let's get to work here -- we've got work to do,' '' Dr. Lauer said. ''But people who are at low risk should be left alone. Giving them treatments is an enormous waste.'' LESSONS OF THE HEART
The P.S.A. protein has become a workhorse of urology. Normally it does not appear in the bloodstream. But it emerges when a man develops prostate cancer, and its levels then soar. When the patient is successfully treated for prostate cancer, his P.S.A. levels ordinarily drop again. So blood tests to detect P.S.A. are widely used to screen for prostate cancer and to monitor men who previously developed the disease and  have been treated for it. Dr. John Holaday, the lead author of the new paper, said he became curious about P.S.A. three years ago, when he noticed a study showing that the protein also occurred in the blood of women with breast cancer and that the more P.S.A. in the blood of these women, the better their prognosis. That made Dr. Holaday ask why he had always assumed that P.S.A. was bad and that high P.S.A. levels were ominous. ''I went to the literature,'' he said,  ''and I couldn't find anything.''
We could be hopeful and optimistic that the patient will have an excellent quality of life. And we can be hopeful and optimistic that the patient will have excellent communication with relatives. Or we can have hope and optimism that patients will have excellent care, really wonderful care at the end of life. We can have lots of hope and optimism that we can effectively treat your symptoms. We can have hope and optimism that the patient will have a good death. Why should 40 percent of Americans die in pain? Most Americans describe a kind of a good death which, very sadly, we are failing to deliver. But not all patients want all the information all of the time. I deplore the practice of truth dumping, or terminal candor, that some physicians espouse. I am not trying to shift the burden of prognostic knowledge from the physician to the patient.
The heart surgery data were clear, he said. The patients who did best were those whose surgeons were most experienced. Some busy doctors at community hospitals had better results than less-busy doctors at major medical centers. ''High-volume surgeons at lower-volume hospitals did just as well as high-volume surgeons at high-volume centers,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. ''And even if you were already at a high-volume hospital, it mattered if you chose a high-volume surgeon,'' he added. ''I think it's partly to do with the complexity of the procedure. How well you will do in the short and long term after a cardiovascular operation is often a function of how well your operation gets done.'' ''But what we found with many or most of the cancer operations was very different,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. A patient's chance of dying during or just after surgery was more related to the number of operations the hospital did and less to the number of operations the surgeon did. And, he reports in a paper that will soon be published in Annals of Surgery, cancer patients who go to hospitals that have more patients with their type of cancer also have better long-term survival.
EVEN before Dr. Michael J. Miller, a plastic surgeon, arrived at a Food and Drug Administration meeting last week on breast implants, he was expecting a highly charged encounter. Which he got. Dr. Miller, a professor at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, was part of an advisory panel charged with deciding whether to recommend that silicone breast implants be allowed back on the market, after an 11-year hiatus. Over two days in Gaithersburg, Md., a crowd of interested observers, including more than 100 speakers, pleaded with the panel to vote their way. ''I went to the meeting very anxious about the level of contentiousness I expected to face and worried about alienating one side or the other,'' Dr. Miller said. ''I sat there wondering, why, why, why is this such a polarizing topic?'' The answer, he decided, was that while debate was cast as one of safety -- are the implants, made by a company called Inamed, safe enough to be sold? -- the underlying question was whether it was acceptable for a woman to enlarge or enhance her breasts. ''This goes far beyond medical considerations,'' Dr. Miller said. ''It involves society and womanhood. All of that is hidden in the question about safety.''
Dr. Westhusin cloned the first cat, in 2002, on his second try. But, he said, after trying for a few years to clone a dog, ''I quit.'' His work with cats and dogs was sponsored by a private company, Genetic Savings &amp; Clone of Sausalito, Calif. Its chief executive, Lou Hawthorne, said the company had spent seven years and more than $19 million in its attempts to clone a dog. It just opened a lab in Madison, Wis., with 50 employees. But, so far, no dogs have been cloned. Other researchers say dog cloning is so hard, they will not try it. George E. Seidel Jr. of Colorado State said Genetic Savings &amp; Clone approached him and ''I refused.'' As for the South Koreans, who succeeded in what is the Mount Everest of cloning, it was ''simply a heroic effort, a brute force heroic effort,'' Dr. Seidel said. Snuppy is the second coup this year for the Seoul researchers. In May, Dr. Hwang's lab announced that it had created cloned human embryos and extracted stem cells from them. The dog project is separate, and its goal, Dr. Hwang explained in an e-mail message, is to use dogs to study the causes and treatment of human diseases.
Some proponents said the scans would enable people to take their health care into their own hands. Critics said the scans were medical nightmares, a powerful medical technology gone out of control. But few anticipated the precipitous reversal of fortune for the scanning centers. In Seattle, Dr. Scott Ramsey of the University of Washington got a federal grant to study patients at nine centers, expecting to enroll 1,500 patients. Last year, when he was ready to begin, only two centers were left, and he enrolled just 50 patients. He also hoped to do a study with a company, ScanQuest, on the scans' effectiveness. ''We were in negotiations when they suddenly stopped returning our phone calls,'' Dr. Ramsey said. It turned out that ScanQuest had gone out of business. ''I've never seen a market for a medical technology collapse so completely,'' Dr. Ramsey said. Whole body scans erupted onto the national scene in 2000, helped in large part by Dr. Harvey Eisenberg, the owner of HealthView, a scanning center in Newport Beach, Calif. Oprah Winfrey, scanned there, featured him on her show, and his competitors watched with interest as he got attention on morning shows like ''Good Morning America'' and ''Today'' as well as in newspapers and magazines like USA Today and Men's Health. Soon, HealthView's waiting list grew to eight months.
''These things are all sort of intertwined together,'' Professor Haiken said. The ultimate example, of course, is plastic surgery, which began in earnest after World War I, according to Professor Haiken's book, and has now reached a point where new words are being used to describe ordinary body variations. ''Bat-wing deformity'' is ''redundant skin and tissue hanging from the upper arms.'' ''Aging neck deformity'' is wrinkled skin on the neck. Others, like ''spare-tire deformity'' and ''violin deformity,'' also called '''saddlebags,'' are just what you think they are. ''It brings you face to face with your own boundaries,'' Professor Haiken said. ''I mean, what is a deformity and what is unattractive? Where is the line? ''I was driving through Kentucky and I heard an ad on the radio: 'Are you not satisfied with your life? Do you think things are missing? Do you need a change that is more than skin deep?' '' she recalled. ''I thought it would be an ad for personal growth.'' But as she continued to listen, she discovered what it really was: an advertisement for plastic surgery.
Ms. Kipfer has also been lifting weights at a gym, which Dr. Gallagher told her would improve her muscle strength and might improve the quality of her bones. But the benefits of weight training are still unclear: there are no randomized trials that show it increases bone density, and several trials that show no effect. With the higher estrogen dose, she gained bone in her spine. Now, she said -- and Dr. Gallagher confirmed -- she has the bone density of a 62-year-old. Her goal is to maintain it. ''She's much better,'' Dr. Gallagher said. Estrogen, he added, ''has made a huge difference.'' The problem, he explained, is that Ms. Kipfer has no good alternative if she wants to prevent further bone loss. While there are effective drugs for osteoporosis, known as bisphosphonates, he worries about giving one to a 56-year-old woman who would have to take it for decades to prevent her bones from deteriorating. These are drugs, like Fosamax and Actonel, that protect against osteoporosis by permanently binding to the surface of bone and slowing the activities of osteoclasts, cells that break bone down.
''Cloned embryos have serious developmental and genetic problems,'' Dr. Yanagimachi said, which usually kill them before birth. Just after birth, he said, more die, usually of lung problems. He added that inbred strains are much harder to clone than hybrid strains of mice, which makes sense, he said. Inbred animals have much less genetic diversity and so less opportunity to bypass genetic errors than hybrid animals. Dr. Westhusin says that when he thinks about what happens in cloning, ''it's a wonder it works at all.'' Scientists knew that every cell in the body has the same genes so, in theory, all the instructions for making a new copy of an adult are present in every cell. But most of the genes in an adult cell, like a skin cell or a brain cell or a liver cell, are silenced. That is why those cells, which have reached their final stage of development, never change. A skin cell does not turn into a heart cell. A brain cell does not turn into a liver cell. And no one expected an egg cell to be able to reprogram such an adult cell, somehow stripping its genes bare of their chemical masks.
The federal government is now telling patients whether their local hospitals are doing what they should. For now, the effort involves three common and deadly afflictions of the elderly -- heart attacks, heart failure and pneumonia -- and asks about lifesaving treatments that everyone agrees should be given but that hospitals and doctors often forget to give. The expectation, though, is that this is just the beginning; other diseases, other treatments and surgery are next. Within a few years, individual doctors will be rated as well. Using incentives like bonus pay and deterrents like public humiliation, it is a bold new effort by the federal government, along with organizations of hospitals, doctors, nurses, and health researchers, to push providers to use proven remedies for common ailments. And it is a response to a sobering reality: lifesaving treatments often are forgotten while doctors and hospitals lavish patients with an abundance of care, which can involve expensive procedures of questionable value. The results are high costs, unnecessary medicine and wasted opportunities to save lives and improve health.
On the same day, the American Academy of Pediatrics, citing brain research, stated that children under 2 years old should not watch television. Period. These events surprised both scientists who study obesity and those who study brain development. Where, they demanded, are the supporting data? There are no data establishing that Americans are getting fatter because they are eating sugar, the researchers said. ''I don't think there's any sound scientific basis to it at all,'' said Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University. Neuroscientists dismissed the American Academy of Pediatrics' statement that television should be discouraged because ''research on early brain development shows that babies and toddlers have a critical need for direct interactions with parents and other significant caregivers (e.g., child care providers) for health brain growth and the development of appropriate social, emotional, and cognitive skills.'' ''There is no data like that at all,'' said Dr. Charles Nelson, a professor of child psychology, neuroscience and pediatrics at the University of Minnesota.
These days more and more patients are asking the same question. Laboratories offer tests for more than 700 human genes, with more being discovered almost daily. And, for almost every gene, some medical institution or some company owns a patent on its use. ''The value of patients' tissues has potentially gone up enormously,'' said Dr. Barry Eisenstein, the vice president for science and technology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. But, Dr. Eisenstein said, patients whose cells provided the genes that have been patented are rarely compensated. Whether any money has been made from tests based on their genes -- and in the case of the AIDS-resistance gene, none yet has -- some patients have become wary about providing their tissue for genetic research. A few have demanded money up front before providing tissue. Others are writing contracts spelling out what they are entitled to if they help scientists find genes.
Canadian scientists report today in a study that women who were exposed to organic solvents like phenol, xylene and acetone during pregnancy had a greatly increased chance of having a baby with a birth defect. But leading experts on birth defects said the study had serious methodological problems. They said they feared that the paper, published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association, would needlessly frighten pregnant women. The research, by Dr. Sohail Khattak, a pediatrician and a clinical pharmacologist, Dr. Gideon Koren, a clinical pharmacologist, and their colleagues at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, involved women who had contacted the hospital's program, Motherisk, for pregnant women who are worried that they have been exposed to something that  might harm their fetuses. The investigators focused on organic solvents that caused birth defects in animals when they were administered in high doses. They compared 125 women who said they were exposed to such chemicals, usually at work, with 125 women who said they were exposed to other chemicals or drugs that had not been known to cause birth defects. As a rough gauge of the exposure, the investigators asked the women if their eyes had watered or if they had had a headache or trouble breathing.
''It all comes back to the same issues -- the whole issue of appetite and weight regulation in humans,'' Dr. Flier said. ''It is at the interface of free will and determinism. There is certainly a strong biological underpinning to our drive to eat and maintain certain weights. We knew that before and we still know it. ''But now there is another layer of mechanisms by which things like hormones not only can affect the neurochemistry that affects how hungry you are but also can affect the wiring of your brain.'' In the first of two papers in Science, Dr. Richard B. Simerly and Dr. Sebastian G. Bouret at the Oregon Primate Research Center in Beaverton examined leptin's effects on the brain early in life. Until now, they had studied how sex hormones, like estrogen and testosterone, affected brain development. But they noticed an earlier paper by Dr. Flier showing that there is a surge of leptin in the brains of newborn mice, looking a lot like the surges of sex hormones that reshape the brain during critical periods early in development. Could leptin, they asked, be doing something similar?
A variety of studies have suggested that in 85 percent of cases it is impossible to say why a person's back hurts, said Dr. Richard Deyo, a professor of medicine and health services at the University of Washington. And most of the time, the pain goes away with or without medical treatment. ''Nearly everyone gets better, nearly everyone improves,'' said Dr. Deyo, citing evidence from large epidemiological studies. But he cautioned, ''Getting better doesn't necessarily mean pain-free.'' ''For a small number of patients,'' he added, ''surgery can offer quick relief, although even then it is common to have mild symptoms and recurrences.'' The Duke researchers, led by Dr. Xeumei Luo, used national data from 1998. Back pain expenses, they say, included $11.1 billion for office visits; $4.5 billion for hospitalization; $3.9 billion for prescription drugs; $4.7 billion for outpatient services; and $1.1 billion for emergency room care, with the rest made up of such things as medical devices. The total, $26 billion, was a 30 percent increase from 1977 after adjusting for inflation.
YOU might think if questions were raised about whether antidepressant drugs can make patients suicidal during the first few weeks of treatment, that scientists would turn to animal testing for further investigation. After all, suicides are rare enough that there are no firm human data on whether the drugs can cause them. But you can do experiments with animals -- examining their brains, giving them high doses of drugs -- that you could never do with people. That might seem like a reasonable course of action, especially after the Food and Drug Administration announced last week that it was so concerned about a possible, though very slight, suicide risk that it wants antidepressant drugs to carry warnings on their labels. But it turns out that animal experiments are not an option. The reason, said Dr. Alan Schatzberg, chairman of the department of psychiatry and behavioral science at Stanford University's School of Medicine, is that ''we don't have an animal model of depression.''
Q.  There has been a lot of talk about health care reform, and at least one major initiative, the Clinton health care plan. Do you foresee another, more successful attempt to reform health care on the horizon?  A.  The Clinton plan was a combination of ignorance and arrogance and it turned out to be a disaster. But I never believed for a minute that they could get major health care reform. Health care reform requires a substantial political investment. You're talking about one-seventh of the economy and huge numbers of interest groups of all kinds. To change the status quo in a major way means you have to achieve a tremendous political reform first. I've been on record for a long time saying that I only see a major health care reform coming to the U.S. in the wake of a war, a large-scale recession or large-scale civil unrest.  Q.  Don't Americans want health care reform?  A.  Two-thirds of the American people say they favor universal coverage, but the minute you start to spell out what that means -- subsidization for the people who are poor and who are sick, and that the plan has to be compulsory -- they are less supportive.  Q.  We subsidize health care in a way, don't we? What about Medicare?  A.  You pay for Medicare but there's going to be more and more resistance to it. Remember, Medicare started as a small program. It was going to be $4 billion or something like that. There's a generalized resistance to higher taxes. People don't exactly realize that a lot of their taxes are going to transfers to the elderly. They just know they are fed up with paying higher taxes. The average working person today pays more in Social Security and Medicare taxes then he pays in income taxes. But they don't express it directly that way. They just don't want to pay more taxes.  Q.  What about current proposals to provide Medicare coverage for prescription benefits?  A.  We see proposals to expand Medicare. And they're politically popular. But then they're going to have to try and figure out how to pay for it. One thing I'll go on record as saying is that the Clinton proposal for paying for prescription drugs makes absolutely no sense. It is a proposal to cover the cost of drugs from the first dollar up to a cap.  Q.  What's wrong the Clinton prescription proposal?  A.  The purpose of insurance is to protect the people who have big expenses. So you ask why do they propose a plan that does just the opposite? Because that's politically popular. People don't think they're paying for somebody else's drugs. Everybody thinks they're going to get a benefit. But that's not insurance. That's not what insurance is for.  Q.  So will Congress succeed in expanding Medicare coverage and reforming health care?  A.  That's a political forecast, isn't it? All my life I've tried to spend more time trying to figure out what the government should do than what they will do.  Q.  What should be done about health care?  A.  I think we should have universal coverage financed by a general, broad-based tax which is earmarked for health care -- such as a value-added tax -- which would give every American a voucher to be part of some health care plan.
The college of obstetricians, for example, cautions, ''The number and sophistication of most studies on alternative therapies, including botanicals, do not meet the current standards of evidence-based recommendations.'' It adds that '' 'natural' does not mean safe or effective,'' and that ''potentially dangerous or lethal drug-herb interactions can occur.'' The National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine also cautions women on its Web site, http://nccam.nih.gov/health/alerts/menopause/, about the claims being made for vitamins, herbs and products like soy that contain plant estrogens. ''At this time, there is not enough scientific evidence to determine whether these therapies are beneficial,'' the Web site says. ''In addition, we do not have sufficient information to show whether these therapies are as safe or safer than conventional drugs being used for menopausal symptoms, osteoporosis or heart disease.'' Makers of the supplements assert that they are safe and effective. Gayle Engles, education director for the Botanical Council, a nonprofit group that disseminates information on herbal medicines, says that many of the products have been in use for hundreds of years and that some have been tested in scientific studies.
Meanwhile, a second federally financed study of the operation is winding to a close, and some researchers say it is time to go back to animal studies and learn more about the complex roles of the brain cells involved in Parkinson's disease. Dr. Weiner said that if a patient came to him today seeking advice, he would say: ''The bottom line for patients is that human fetal cell transplants are not currently the best way to go. If you are willing to pay for them, you can still have them done. But my advice is you ought not to do this.''
A recent report, issued in June by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Risks, is 287 pages long and devoted entirely to evaluating the linear-nonthreshold model. It explains that the council ''has sought to leave no significant aspect of the subject unaddressed.'' Its conclusion? For lack of a better model, it recommends keeping the linear one. ''There is not conclusive evidence on which to reject'' the model, the report says, adding that ''it may never be possible to prove or disprove the validity of the linear nonthreshold assumption.''
Other studies, like the Minnesota Heart Survey, a survey of more than 5,000 people taken every five years in Minneapolis and St. Paul, came to similar conclusions: nearly 60 percent of men with high cholesterol levels were unaware of them or were untreated. Among women, the percentage was more than 67 percent. ''We have wonderful, powerful tools to normalize cholesterol and prevent heart disease,'' said Dr. Thomas A. Pearson, chairman of the University of Rochester's department of community and preventive medicine. ''We have all the tools we need. And we're not getting the job done.'' The guidelines in question recommend that levels of low density lipoproteins, or L.D.L., which carry cholesterol to the arteries, be below 100 for those at highest risk, below 130 for those of more moderate risk, and below 160 for others. Large clinical trials found that lowering L.D.L. to such levels sharply decreases the risk of heart attacks.
So far, though, the researchers at Advanced Cell Technology have not succeeded -- most of the eggs died without dividing even once. Their best attempt was an embryo that grew to six cells before dying. They had hoped to use cloned human embryos to extract stem cells, which are embryo cells that can in theory develop into any cell or body tissue and that the company hopes to use to treat diseases. With cloning, the embryos and so the stem cells could be made genetically identical to a patient who needs the treatment. But stem cells appear only after about five days of growth and the company's embryos were not even close. This lack of success was not a surprise to leading stem cell researchers and cloning experts who attended a meeting last week on regenerative medicine, which is based on the idea of using new cells and organs to regenerate failing human bodies. Most of these researchers have concluded that routinely cloning animals or growing human embryo clones long enough to extract stem cells could be years or even decades away, and Dr. Dominko said her experience with monkeys might tell why.
Dr. Fletcher said she was disappointed by the conclusion but not surprised by it. The study's directors had told the women in the study twice before, in 2000 and in 2001, that those taking the drugs seemed to have slightly more heart attacks, blood clots and strokes than those taking placebos, although the risks were not enough to stop the study. ''Even though I was upset by these results, that's the reason you do clinical trials,'' Dr. Fletcher said. Now the question is, what should women do? Dr. Victoria Kusiak, who is vice president of clinical affairs and North American director at Wyeth, the largest maker of the hormones, emphasized that there were no other effective treatments for the symptoms of menopause. While some women are not bothered by those symptoms, others are miserable, Dr. Kusiak said. ''Eighty-five percent of women do have symptoms,'' she said. ''The hot flushes, the night sweats, are not just annoying -- they can interfere with your life.''
Of course, there were people in previous generations who lived long and healthy lives, and there are people today whose lives are cut short by disease or who suffer for years with chronic ailments. But on average, the changes, researchers say, are huge. Even more obvious differences surprise scientists by the extent of the change. In 1900, 13 percent of people who were 65 could expect to see 85. Now, nearly half of 65-year-olds can expect to live that long. People even look different today. American men, for example, are nearly 3 inches taller than they were 100 years ago and about 50 pounds heavier. ''We've been transformed,'' Dr. Fogel said. What next? scientists ask. Today's middle-aged people are the first generation to grow up with childhood vaccines and with antibiotics. Early life for them was much better than it was for their parents, whose early life, in turn, was much better than it was for their parents.
In a report last year on radiation standards, the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said: ''The standards administered by E.P.A. and N.R.C. to protect the public from low-level radiation exposure do not have a conclusive scientific basis, despite decades of research.'' The situation is further confused, experts say, because regulatory standards are a hodgepodge. The Environmental Protection Agency advocates a standard for all radiation exposure from a single source or site at 15 millirem a year, with no more than 4 coming from ground water. A standard chest X-ray, in comparison, gives about 10 millirem to the chest, which is equivalent to 1 or 2 millirem to the whole body. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission sets its acceptable level of radiation exposure from any one source at 25 millirem a year. In contrast, the natural level of background radiation in the United States, on average, is about 350 millirem a year, and in some areas of the country it is many times higher than that.
Dr. Hahn said her group was starting to study chimpanzees that were completely wild, outside the groups where they live with primatologists,  collecting urine and feces from forests where the animals live. The group members will not be able to say which individual animals provided the samples or whether animals that may be infected are healthy or ill. But, she said, they will be able to ask whether infections are common or rare among other subspecies of chimpanzees, including Pan troglodytes troglodytes. In the meantime, AIDS researchers are looking at the course of infections among wild animals and wondering what that course says about the future of human AIDS. Why, they ask, are wild cats, African monkeys, and, it seems, chimpanzees, so impervious to illness from the viruses? Dr. Mark Feinberg, a professor of medicine, microbiology and immunology at Emory University, focused on sooty mangabeys, West African monkeys that are widely infected with a virus that is identical to H.I.V.-2, a human AIDS virus that has infected people in West Africa but has not caused a worldwide epidemic.
A general rule in medicine, Dr. Rossouw said, has been that treatments that reduce the risk of disease in healthy people are even more effective in people who already have the disease. At Harvard, statisticians, including Dr. Michels and Dr. Robins, are planning ways to look at the data from the nurses and find what went wrong. Did the analyses miss something? Was there a better way to make statistical adjustments? ''There must be an explanation,'' Dr. Michels said. ''There is only one truth.''
It's also very clear that over time the introduction of some drugs and some medical procedures does improve health. Neonatal intensive care units, the survival of low-birth-weight babies. That's improved enormously, and almost all of it is due to better medical interventions: both better scientific understanding what it takes to keep a 1,000 gram baby alive and the technology to do it. On the other hand, I don't want to overstate the payoff because medical research has done virtually nothing to lower the incidence of low birth-weight babies. In the cardiovascular and cerebrovascular area, the combination of a much more aggressive treatment of hypertension and better drugs had a big payoff in lowering deaths from heart attacks and -- probably more important -- in deaths from strokes.  Q.  Are you saying that even though some medicine makes a difference, more medical care can't do much to make us more healthy?  A.  I'm saying that almost everyone is getting the medical care that matters to health. Adding more care does not make much difference. The stuff that's really effective, the antibiotics, the appendectomies and so forth -- people get them. Health depends much more on the things we do to and for ourselves or that we don't do.
Rumors of steroid use persist in all sports. Major League baseball will begin testing for it next year. For athletes, the mixed messages are all too clear. Sports fans do not want to see smaller, slower linemen and backs in football or snooze through the 150th-fastest running of the 100 meters at the next Olympics, Dr. Yesalis said. ''They don't give a damn. They just want to be entertained.'' In Search of the Truth  The Street Word And the Textbooks Shalender Bhasin, the endocrinologist, used to think he knew all about anabolic steroids. He knew what was in the textbooks and the medical journals, which was very different from the word on the street. He knew that the folklore said the drugs increased muscle mass. ''The scientific opinion was that that was hogwash,'' Dr. Bhasin said. The folklore said higher doses produced greater effects. He did not believe it. The textbooks told him there was no evidence for that notion.
Over the next century, diet evangelism continued, with diet books and gurus extolling one program after another. Yet, notes Dr. Schwartz, ''We keep coming back to the same kinds of diets recycled under different names.'' With the emergence of each new trend, he said, ''there is a different explanation of why it is effective.'' Today, more than ever, those who want to lose weight find themselves pushed and pulled by diet converts. Jerry Gordon, a Philadelphia record producer, says that, at 5 feet 4 and 227 pounds, he is an obvious target for proselytizers, including his slender wife, who lives on a low-calorie diet. ''She has been trying to get me to eat and behave like her for the last 22 years,'' he says. On the other hand, it seems as if everywhere he looks, people are dropping pounds and telling him they are doing it not by restricting calories, but with a low-carbohydrate diet. Mr. Gordon enrolled in a research study, conducted by Dr. Foster, that randomly assigns people to the Atkins diet or a low-calorie one. He confesses that he was hoping for the Atkins diet. But he got the low-calorie one. ''My wife is real excited,'' he said.
Some experts, however, worry about stigmatizing Jews. ''It's a dilemma,'' said Jayne C. Gershkowitz, director of the National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases Association. Ms. Gershkowitz fears that Jews will be seen as a people uniquely afflicted with 10 genetic diseases. In fact, most diseases occur in the general population, too, although the genes are much less prevalent. Other ethnic groups have their own genetic diseases. For example, people of Mediterranean ancestry may have genes for an iron storage disease, beta-thalassemia, and blacks and Mediterraneans may have genes for sickle cell disease. Others worry about how people will use the screening information and whether or not they should. Lori B. Andrews, a professor of law and an ethicist at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, said the screening might be the start of a troubling era, as people receive information they may not be prepared to handle about diseases that may or may not prove deadly.
For several years now, Dr. Beatrice H. Hahn and Dr. George M. Shaw, AIDS researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, have been well aware that the scientific evidence for the origins of AIDS had a few crucial gaps. And they intended to fill them. But, as their new research has now shown, AIDS viruses do not always behave as expected. The investigation began when the Alabama scientists and others argued that the AIDS virus causing the devastating human epidemic originated in chimpanzees. It jumped to humans decades ago, they said, probably when infected animals were killed and eaten. The evidence was three captive chimpanzees, all infected with a virus closely resembling the one that causes AIDS and all of a subspecies, Pan troglodytes troglodytes, that lives in west-central Africa. So, scientists hypothesized, AIDS originated there. Investigators also found a fourth captive chimpanzee that was infected with a genetically distinct AIDS-like virus. No one knew where this animal came from, but Dr. Hahn and others said it must be from somewhere other than west-central Africa -- its virus was just too different from the one in the other three animals.
Dr. Hays cautioned that if a treatment was powerful enough to relieve the symptoms of menopause, it was also powerful enough to harm. But despite the uncertainties, she and the other investigators in the study say they cannot just shrug their shoulders and duck women's questions. They at least have to try to respond. ''I feel like this is our obligation,'' Dr. Hays said. ''We stirred up this hornet's nest.''
''We don't think there is a hint of a benefit,'' he said. The new study's conclusions, being published today in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come just a few months after another study concluded that early detection with CT scans could save lives. The main difference between the two studies, cancer researchers say, is the question of what counts as evidence of effectiveness, a decline in the death rate from lung cancer or an increase in survival time after a diagnosis. Estimating survival, as the previous study did, can be misleading, a number of researchers said, which is why they place less credence in it. The debate is unlikely to be settled until a more conclusive study, now under way and involving more than 50,000 people, is concluded. That study, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, randomly assigned people to have CT scans or not and asked whether the death rate from lung cancer was lower in those who had scans. It will be several years until its results are known. In the meantime, Dr. Bach emphasized that neither his study nor the previous one was definitive.
As steroid use seeped into sports and bodybuilding, historians say, muscles became more desirable for ordinary men and women. Steroids were classified a controlled substance by Congress in 1990, but cultural change made them seem more appealing. Men, Mr. Fair said, became entranced with Arnold Schwarzenegger and began craving big, hard bodies. Women, who had been barred from weight-lifting rooms, found that the doors had opened with the passage of Title IX, the 1973 law that required universities receiving federal funds to provide women with equal access to athletic facilities. Now, Dr. Pope of Harvard said, the transformation is everywhere. Women in the centerfolds of men's magazines are increasingly muscular. Male models in advertisements and on magazine covers increasingly appear shirtless, muscles bulging. Even G.I. Joe was affected. ''G.I. Joe in the 1960's used to be perfectly ordinary looking,'' Dr. Pope said. But over the years, he added, the action figure pumped up.
Another concern, obesity researchers say, is possible long-term effects of taking the drug for life. ''What else is this doing to the brain?'' Dr. Leibel asked. ''We know little or nothing.'' Yet over and over again in drug development, he said, it has turned out that ''long-term consequences are different than we might expect.'' Still, he and others say, rimonabant is a start. It represents a new way to help people lose weight, and might become one of several drugs that hit the body's weight regulatory system in different places, enhancing each other's effects. Dr. Pi-Sunyer says a combination of drugs may someday be found to effectively treat obesity. As for rimonabant, he said, ''it's another drug in the armamentarium; it shouldn't be called a miracle.'' Dr. Flier said he had similar advice for the drug companies and venture capitalists who call him: ''I tell them, 'Don't stop doing research because of this.'''
Asked in a telephone news conference if the agency will start requiring longer-term studies for drugs of this class, Dr. Galson said no decision had been reached. ''It's too early to say right now, but obviously we will be more interested in long-term data,'' he replied. Dr. Kim of Merck said he first learned of the new data on heart attacks and strokes on Thursday evening last week, when he got a call from an independent committee of scientists who were monitoring the colon polyp study. ''They recommended we stop the study,'' he said. ''On Friday, I looked at the data with my team,'' Dr. Kim said. ''The first thing you do is review the data. We did that. Second is you double-check the data, go through it and make sure that everything is O.K.'' At that point, he said, ''I knew that barring some big mistake in the analysis, we had an issue here.''
''I really think the news is good. The challenge is getting the patients to be aware of the fact that they have some risk.''
The agency's announcement last month that it would prohibit the sale of ephedra was a move sought by liberal Democrats like Senator Edward M. Kennedy and consumer groups like Public Citizen's Health Research Group. It was just the beginning of a crackdown on supplements, Dr. McClellan promised. ''While most supplements are probably safe in the dose people take them, we are concerned about a number of other dietary supplements that are currently on the market,'' he said in a speech Tuesday. ''And we intend to do more to take a closer look at them.'' In another move that could be construed as hindering business, Dr. McClellan deferred a decision on whether to allow silicone breast implants back on the market after more than a decade-long hiatus. He said the F.D.A. needed more data on safety. ''I've been pleasantly surprised,'' said Cynthia Pearson, executive director of the National Women's Health Network, which wanted ephedra banned and more data on implants.
''You hear their sad story,'' he said, referring to doctors who have been patients, ''and then you ask, 'Well, did you say anything to the person who was offensive to you or treated you poorly?' Ninety-nine point nine percent of the time the answer is no.'' One reason, of course, is fear of offending the doctor and getting poorer treatment from then on. But doctors who are rated by their medical groups are forced to confront the evidence, and often are asked to get help or are coerced into it. For example, said Dr. Bangasser, doctors at his group, the Beaver Medical Group in Redlands, Calif., who get low patient satisfaction scores have been asked to shadow successful doctors to learn their ways. For other doctors, there are counseling and training sessions as well as courses, including some taught by Dr. Lown's group, to help doctors learn to listen to patients and treat them with dignity and respect.
''We are going to conduct a review of the data from the Women's Health Initiative study and evaluate the product and the product labeling in light of those data,'' said Susan Cruzan, an agency spokeswoman. Ms. Cruzan said the agency would also consider whether there should be changes in labeling for formulations of the hormones made by other companies. But she added that the work had just begun. ''Until we have more details, there's not a whole lot we can say,'' Ms. Cruzan said. Dr. Bruce Burlington, the head of regulatory affairs at Wyeth, said the company was already planning to change Prempro's label. The company began meeting with the drug agency officials as soon as the results from the Women's Health Initiative were announced. ''We told them we needed to get warnings out and solid information out,'' Dr. Burlington said. In addition to changing its label to reflect the more detailed information provided by the Women's Health Initiative study, he said, Wyeth would send letters to about half a million doctors informing them of the study's findings.
The question, he said, is whether the screening tests are detecting cancers. ''Early diagnosis makes sense if you are diagnosing a true cancer,'' he added. In neuroblastoma, he said, the problem was that the test was not finding true cancers. It was finding tumors that did not need to be treated and was missing those that were deadly. To everyone's surprise, it turned out that the supposedly rare spontaneous regressions were actually the most common form of neuroblastoma tumors. No one had noticed them before because, without the screening test, very few of those tumors had ever been detected. The Nature of Cancer  Lazy Cells Upset Traditional Ideas Dr. William Woods, a neuroblastoma expert at the Aflac Cancer Center of Emory University in Atlanta, cited a powerful lesson: ''The theory that one can pick up all cancers early and have the outcome good is not correct,'' he said. ''It certainly is not correct for neuroblastoma.''
''We're close to being able to put our arms around the whole cancer problem,'' said Robert Weinberg, a biology professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a member of the Whitehead Institute. ''We've completed the list of all cancer cells needed to create a malignancy,'' Dr. Weinberg said. ''And I wouldn't have said that five years ago.'' The list includes roughly 10 pathways that cells use to become cancerous and that involve a variety of crucial genetic alterations. There are genetic changes that end up spurring cell growth and others that result in the jettisoning of genes that normally slow growth. There are changes that allow cells to keep dividing, immortalizing them, and ones that allow cells to live on when they are deranged; ordinarily, a deranged cell kills itself. Still other changes let cancer cells recruit normal tissue to support and to nourish them. And with some changes, Dr. Weinberg said, cancer cells block the immune system from destroying them.
The group also has a compound that blocks the last step in the assembly of the anthrax toxin -- a seven-sided structure that assembles on the surface of a cell and then delivers the toxins into the cell. This antitoxin sticks to the heptagonal anthrax toxin and prevents it from delving into the cell. The researchers tested it with the same sort of rat tests, with the same results, Dr. Collier said. Another line of research involves a new type of antibiotic against anthrax bacteria. It was discovered by Dr. Lucy Shapiro, a Stanford microbiologist, and Dr. Stephen J. Benkovic, a chemist at Penn State, and their colleagues, who initially had no intention of going after anthrax. Instead, Dr. Shapiro said, they were designing a drug to inactivate a crucial enzyme used by so-called gram negative bacteria, a class that does not include anthrax. The made six new drugs, and all worked against gram negative bacteria in laboratory experiments, wiping out gram-negative bacteria that cause the diseases brucellosis and tularemia. Both bacteria are considered potential germ warfare weapons.
''I would say that in two-thirds of the offices I visit, they ask, 'What does the task force say?''' Dr. Zwolak said. With the new recommendation, he says, he expects Congress to require Medicare to pay for screening. ''It's just wonderful what the task force has done,'' Dr. Zwolak said. His main concern, shared by his colleague Dr. Jack L. Cronenwett, the chief of vascular surgery at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, is that the recommendations do not go far enough. Women with a family history of the aneurysms and who have smoked have the same risk as a nonsmoking man, Dr. Cronenwett said. ''If Medicare bases a coverage decision on the recommendations, a woman could have three brothers with aneurysms and she could be a smoker and she still wouldn't get reimbursement,'' Dr. Cronenwett said. Medicare does pay for the repair of aneurysms by either of two methods. One involves opening the abdomen and replacing the damaged area with a synthetic tubing. In the other method, endovascular repair, a doctor threads a catheter through the groin to the aneurysm and relines the damaged section of blood vessel from the inside, inserting a segment of synthetic material.
In his paper, Dr. Beecher, who died in 1976, reviewed about a dozen studies that compared placebos with active treatments and concluded that placebos had medical effects. ''He came up with the magical 35 percent number that has entered placebo mythology,'' Dr. Hrobjartsson said. But, Dr. Hrobjartsson said, diseases naturally wax and wane. And no matter how sick the person is, a truly bad spell will almost inevitably be followed by a period in which the condition seems to improve. What if the natural variation in a disease's course is behind the placebo effect, they asked? ''Of the many articles I looked through, no article distinguished between a placebo effect and the natural course of a disease,'' Dr. Hrobjartsson said. ''This is a very banal error to make, but sometimes banal errors are made.'' He and Dr. Gotzsche began looking for well-conducted studies that divided patients into three groups, giving one a real medical treatment, one a placebo and one nothing at all. That was the only way, they reasoned, to decide whether placebos had any medical effect.
Even surveys by the people who are most inclined to be concerned about the uninsured show that the uninsured get about two-thirds of the health care they would get if they had insurance. So people do get care. They don't get the same care that others necessarily get. They don't get it under the same conditions that other people get it. But there are not many people who simply die in the streets, although they're the ones who make the newspapers.  Q.  There is widespread concern about the nation's health care bill. What do you think of the proposed ways of cutting it?  A.  Any time you want to reduce health care spending one of two things comes up. Let's reduce physicians' incomes or let's cut drug industry profits. But these are one-time cuts. These are not cuts that reduce the rate of growth. Unless you cut the underlying forces that allow for growth, you make a tiny little difference.
Another underappreciated problem, osteoporosis experts say, is a lack of vitamin D, which bones need to absorb calcium and phosphorus. Vitamin D deficiencies greatly increase the risk of fractures. Yet a new national study by Dr. Michael Holick of Boston University, of about 1,500 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, found that half had vitamin D levels below what is considered ideal. Vitamin D is made in the skin in response to sun exposure, but many people do not get enough sunlight, Dr. Siris said, noting that there is a concern about skin cancer. ''People today are sun-averse,'' she said. ''And in the elderly, who don't go outdoors, this is a real issue.'' She added that the deficiency was easily corrected by vitamin D supplements that cost as little as $3.40 for 100 pills. Osteoporosis is a real problem, Dr. Siris said. ''This is not something made up by the pharmaceutical industry.''
''In some people's minds, they would rather do it their way and try to force the agency to their point of view than to hear something they don't want to hear,'' Dr. Peck said. But, he said, Dr. McClellan's instincts are good. ''This is a commissioner who has his finger on the pulse on the right arteries,'' Dr. Peck said. Another goal of Dr. McClellan would fulfill a longtime wish of the food industry, to change the standard for making health claims for foods. Until now, food manufacturers could not put such claims on food labels unless there was significant scientific agreement that the claim was correct. Now, an F.D.A. task force is looking for ways to enable companies to make qualified health claims when the weight of scientific evidence, in the agency's opinion, supports them. Labels might say, ''many scientific studies suggest'' or ''some scientific studies suggest,'' for example.
When Dr. Kern started the journal a few years ago, his colleagues commended him, and chuckled about it. ''People would come up and pat me on the back and say they had a good laugh and that it was quite unique,'' Dr. Kern said. But few sent him their negative results. ''I don't know how I could make it easier for them,'' Dr. Kern said. ''At times I would call people and kind of nudge them,'' he added, but to little avail. He thinks it is because scientists do not want to give their competitors an advantage. ''They now know something they're not going to do again and their competitor does not,'' Dr. Kern said. He said a postdoctoral student might have spent seven or eight months on a failed attempt. ''As a consolation to the poor postdoc, you say, 'One thing you do know is what genes not to look at.' That provides a warm feeling in their heart. But the moment they submit it for publication, that warm feeling goes away.''
''I remember the feelings and the thoughts were, 'How did I ever allow it to get out of my control? This wasn't supposed to happen to me,' '' Ms. Barton said. She tried fad diets, like a high-protein diet and the Scarsdale diet. Once she fasted for two weeks. But the pounds she lost came right back. Alarmed, her mother took her to a doctor  because she was convinced that Ms. Barton must have a thyroid problem. She turned out to be perfectly healthy. Just fat. After college, Ms. Barton moved to Denver. There, over two years, she assiduously dieted and exercised and the weight slowly came off. With her weight down to 135 pounds, a perfect size 8, Ms. Barton decided that that awful period of her life as a fat woman was behind her. Now that she was thin she would never have to think about dieting again.
Some medical experts, in fact, have argued that mammography's effects in reducing the cancer death rate are so small that the screening test might even have no such effect. So the questions have been: Are the small tumors found by mammography, treated with surgery and cured, mostly ones that were not dangerous to start with? If they had not been detected so early, would they have remained in the breast and never spread? Are there significant numbers of small tumors that, had they not been found and removed, would have turned deadly? And are there tumors that, however early they are found, have already spread? The answers, researchers say, are going to come from sophisticated analyses of gene activity in cancer cells, looking not just at one or two genes but arrays of genes that can reveal a tumor's propensities. Such studies, for example, are expected to address a fundamental problem of treatment.
John Fletcher, an ethicist, said it was the uncertainty about the value of spiral CT scanning that made him want a randomized clinical trial. ''We're in a situation that the experts call equipoise, where we really don't know if spiral CT scanning is better than usual care,'' Dr. Fletcher said. But, Dr. Fletcher, an emeritus professor at the University of Virginia, told participants at the meeting, ''There is a window of opportunity here that you will lose when the pressure to do the test is so high that you can't resist it and it becomes a de facto standard of care.'' For that reason, Dr. Anthony B. Miller of the German Cancer Research Institute in Heidelberg said, ''the message we're getting is, let's get on with it.''
BUT leptin is just the beginning. ''The discovery of leptin has propelled obesity research from a backwater of scientific activity into one of the major growth areas in biomedicine,'' said Dr. Stephen O'Rahilly, a professor of metabolic medicine at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge, England. ''Once leptin goes to the brain, the next switches in that circuit really are likely to lead to advances in obesity.'' Dr. Andrew Greenberg, an author with Dr. Heymsfield of the new leptin paper and the director of the program in human obesity at the Agriculture Department's Human Nutrition Research Center at Tufts University, cautioned that the research has hardly begun. ''Where we are in obesity is where people were in cholesterol research 15 years ago,'' Dr. Greenberg said. ''They were just beginning to define the mechanisms.'' But Dr. Heymsfield said the leptin discovery has allowed him to envision a pharmacological end to obesity. ''I see it, '' he said, ''as the dawn of the molecular era in obesity therapeutics.''
''Only the screening group had mammograms,'' Dr. Berry said. ''On second look at a woman's first mammogram, one might find that breast cancer was present at the time but it had been missed,'' he said. So more women might have been excluded from the mammography group after they developed breast cancer. The two experts agree that there is no way to resolve their disagreement. ''It's amazingly complicated,'' Dr. Freedman said. Dr. Berry said the only way that he could feel comfortable with the data would be if someone could find the women who were excluded from the trial after they were assigned to have mammograms or not, discover how many died of breast cancer, and then ask if those data altered the conclusions. That, Dr. Freedman and Dr. Berry concur, would not be an easy task, and no one, so far, has volunteered to undertake it. Dr. Freedman and Dr. Berry also disagree about the interpretation of a more recent study, from Canada, that found no benefit from mammograms.
Dr. Harmon Eyre, the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, disagreed with Dr. Lerner's characterization of the group's efforts. In the 1950's, he said, the cancer society was promoting awareness of breast cancer but not early detection ''because there wasn't evidence for it'' yet. Dr. Eyre added, ''The American Cancer Society has always tried to follow scientific evidence without overpromoting early detection.'' Now, half a century later, the predeterminist argument is re-emerging, but few are saying it is entirely right -- and few say it is entirely wrong. The questions are similar to the ones raised in the old debate but far more nuanced: How often are tumors predetermined at the time they are found? And can you figure out a tumor's fate? The current arguments were fueled by recent debates over mammography. The screening test can find tumors that are too small to feel, but large studies comparing women who had mammograms with women who did not failed to find that the screening test had a major effect on the breast cancer death rate.
They said that the different methods did not alter the conclusion that there were many more flu deaths in the 1990's ''The increase from 20,000 to 36,000 is a true increase,'' Dr. Fukuda said in a telephone briefing. He added that the group had unpublished data, from applying the older statistical model to the 1990's data, that confirmed the recent increase in deaths. Dr. Fukuda emphasized that the increase did not mean that the virus was deadlier, noting that the odds that it would kill a person of any particular age had not changed. Rather, he said, there are more people living to very old ages when they are extremely susceptible. ''We are seeing this tremendous increase in older people in the United States,'' Dr. Fukuda said. ''People 85 and above is the fastest-growing group in the elderly population.'' The paper did not reveal the details of the statistical analysis, nor did it provide influenza death rates for people of different ages. That, in particular, was a serious drawback, said Dr. David Freedman, a statistician at the University of California.
Scientists could find brain endorphin levels by doing spinal taps on volunteers as they ran. But that, Dr. Akil said, ''is hardly the noninvasive procedure that might allow one to capture the elation of running,'' she said. Nor is another method, PET scans of the brain, as people run. An alternative approach may be to give volunteers drugs to block brain endorphins, said Dr. Gavril Pasternak, a neurologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. But, he said, if the subjects do not get the runner's high, is it because the drugs are blocking endorphins, because the subjects are not exercising vigorously enough, because the runner's high itself is so unpredictable, or because there are a variety of endorphins contained in a variety of nerves? If they did get a runner's high, would that be because endorphins found alternative ways to exert their effects or because molecules other than endorphins were involved? Or was it perhaps because the drugs did not block the right endorphins or that they acted in the wrong part of brain?
Another incentive is the medical equipment supplied by drug companies. CV Therapeutics, for example, gave its Russian doctors treadmills for exercise testing, and sent technicians to their offices to teach them how to do the test. ''That was a perk for them,'' Dr. Lange said. Patients in other countries are also more eager to take part in clinical trials. In the United States, companies have to advertise heavily to find patients. In Russia, Mr. Leach said, word of mouth usually suffices. Because the government does not pay for prescription drugs and few people can afford to buy them, the patients see clinical trials as their best chance for medications. ''Eastern European and Russian people tend to be very compliant,'' Mr. Leach said. ''Because they are getting medical treatment they couldn't afford and getting Western medicine, they will follow the trial and they will do whatever is asked. If they have to keep a diary, they do it. If they have to make office visits, they do it.''
Mrs. Brandt, who is 63, says that after her initial diagnosis and a lumpectomy, she went to the University of Pennsylvania's hospital and she became a patient of Dr. John Glick. She had radiation treatments and chemotherapy at Penn and is now going through more chemotherapy there because her cancer has spread. ''I never considered going anywhere else,'' Mrs. Brandt said. ''Dr. Glick is at the top of his research game, and from the beginning he instilled great confidence in me and my family.'' Other patients, Dr. Glick said, are eager to return to their local doctors for chemotherapy and follow-up care, and he encourages it whenever he thinks it is appropriate. Penn has a network of community physicians, and other academic hospitals, like Memorial Sloan-Kettering, have suburban satellite centers. ''We try to get patients back into our network of community physicians if we think the same care can be given,'' Dr. Glick said. If there is a specialized surgical technique or treatment that is available only at Penn, though, he encourages patients to stay at Penn for that treatment.
Mr. Gordon said the report had an immediate impact on the implant litigation. ''A number of people have settled their cases on the basis of this report,'' he said. ''Now the women are feeling a little ripped off.'' Mr. Eittreim, the Bristol-Myers lawyer, criticized the motion by the plaintiffs' lawyers as ''the latest effort by the plaintiffs to discredit the science panel's results.'' ''One thing they can't abide is serious scientists looking at these issues,'' Mr. Eittreim said. Noting that the instructions to the panelists gave as an example of conflict of interest a ''significant financial investment or close tie to a corporate defendant,'' he said: ''By no stretch of the imagination could this be considered a significant financial investment or a close tie. The money was really no money at all. It didn't  even reimburse his expenses.'' Mr. Eittreim said the next step was for Bristol-Myers Squibb to file its response with Judge Pointer's office, which he said it would do by the end of this week.
When Mike Gallo learned he had cancer, a B cell lymphoma, two years ago, his friends and relatives told him that they knew how he got it. His cancer, Dr. Gallo's friends said, was obviously caused by the dioxin that he had worked with for three decades in his laboratory. After all, the Environmental Protection Agency classifies dioxin as a probable human carcinogen.  And among the cancers that it may increase the risk for, in high doses, is lymphoma. Dr. Michael A. Gallo, director of the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences Center of Excellence at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick, N.J., tells his well-meaning advisers that he does not think so. ''I say, 'No, I know my blood levels of dioxin,' '' Dr. Gallo said, explaining that he measured them when he worked with the chemical. His levels, he said, are low. And there is no way to make a leap from such low levels of dioxin to his cancer.
In the meantime, Dr. Stephen E. Straus, the director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, said as many as 20 percent of menopausal women use herbal products, like soy or red clover or black cohosh to relieve symptoms. The risks, and benefits, of these products are unknown, he said. ''There are no long-term studies -- not of safety, not of effectiveness.'' Dr. Straus said. Yet large rigorous studies will be a long time coming, he explained, because they require extensive preliminary scientific research before they could be justified. ''We are not there yet,'' he said.
But others said that they were uncertain and that they were having a hard time coming to terms with the profound flaws they now saw in studies they had thought put mammograms on solid ground. ''What this new material has contributed is a softening, at least in my mind, of what I thought was true,'' said Dr. Isra Levy of the Canadian Medical Association. ''I still think that for women aged 50 to 69 there might be something there. But we've had our confidence shaken.'' In the end, the group decided not to deal with age, saying doubts persisted for women of all ages. The group focused on flaws in the studies that were recently uncovered by two scientists in Denmark. The report, published in October by Dr. Peter C. Gotzsche and Ole Olsen of the Nordic Cochrane Center in Copenhagen, concluded that the case for the screening was unproven. The studies were so poorly designed and carried out that they might have found benefits when there were none or exaggerated what benefits there were, the researchers said. None of the studies found that mammography prolonged life, and even when the studies were analyzed as a group, women who had the test lived no longer, dying of diseases other than breast cancer.
The Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday that all companies making drugs that contain estrogen or estrogen and progestin for menopausal women must include a boxed warning on labels stating that the drugs may slightly increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and breast cancer. The agency said that since a large federal study concluded last summer that Prempro, a drug made by Wyeth, slightly increased those risks, it must be assumed that all other products containing estrogen, including patches, creams and pills, have similar problems unless proved otherwise. Until now, only Prempro's label mentioned the risks, which were stated in boldface type on the label but were not in a box. The company changed its label in August to include the risks after findings from the federal study, the Women's Health Initiative. The company also sent letters to a half-million doctors informing them of the results. The study found that the risks from the drugs were not outweighed by their benefits, a slight reduction in bone fractures and colon cancer. Prempro's warning will now also be in a black box, and the company is mailing additional letters to doctors informing them of the drug agency's action.
Excited, Dr. Wolozin examined the records of 56,790 patients at three hospitals. The results exceeded his wildest hopes. Those who were taking statins had a 70 percent reduction in the prevalence of Alzheimer's. Two journals rejected his paper, saying that he needed to learn statistics and that his results had to be a fluke. But he had a feeling that they were correct. He submitted the paper to The Archives of Neurology, which published it in 2000. A few months later, Dr. Hershel Jick of the Boston University School of Medicine and his colleagues reported in The Lancet that they had compared 284 patients with Alzheimer's to 1,080 people with no dementia. In the patients who had taken statins, the scientists found, the risk of Alzheimer's was reduced by 70 percent. Two other groups reproduced the observations. Other researchers found that statins protected genetically engineered mice that normally developed brain changes like those found in Alzheimer's.
Ms. Barish said she was not at all convinced that the pollutants were not causing breast cancer. ''I refuse to accept the fact that they didn't find anything,'' she said. ''They didn't find anything conclusive because in the scientific world it has to be exact.'' But, she added, ''they couldn't say 100 percent that there wasn't a link.'' And so, Ms. Barish said, the story is not over. ''We need to do a lot more studies,'' she said. Others said it may be time to close the books. ''I think it is important that these studies have been done,'' said Dr. Barbara Hulka, an emeritus professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina. ''We ought to be on the cautious side.'' But this and other studies of environmental pollutants and cancer have not found the suspected link, she said. ''There comes a point after so many studies are done that it becomes less productive to continue that line of work.''
And when the movie is based on a true story about a woman who really was named Erin Brockovich, the questions of what is real and what is not become further muddled. Scientists suspect that audiences will decide that the fiction is that Erin Brockovich does not actually look like Julia Roberts, who plays her, but that they will assume that the science, of course, is fact. That, to many scientists, spoils the movie. In science, how you reach a conclusion really matters. It is hard for scientists to enjoy watching a movie that ignores, as though it is irrelevant, the hard-won but ultimately glorious knowledge of how to decide when perceived risks are real and when they are not. In the movie, Ms. Brockovich is a law office file clerk with a high school education who stumbles upon a group of people in Hinkley, Calif., who have been visited by a Job-like plague of ailments. Their illnesses include uterine cancer, breast cancer, Hodgkin's disease, cancer of the brain stem, gastrointestinal cancer, miscarriages, chronic nosebleeds, asthma, heart failure and immune system disorders.
At its base, ''Intuition'' is a novel about scientific fraud. A postdoctoral student becomes suspicious that another postdoc's dazzling discovery might not be all it seems. His data seem too good to be true. It is a tale that evokes the famous case in the 1980's, when a postdoctoral student, Margot O'Toole, accused a researcher in David Baltimore's lab, Thereza Imanishi-Kari, of faking data published in the journal Cell. As in the Baltimore case, the allegations in Ms. Goodman's novel end up with an investigation by the National Institutes of Health, hearings in Congress and an appeal. (In the real case, Dr. Imanishi-Kari was exonerated.) But Ms. Goodman's novel is neither science history nor anthropology. She did read a book on the Baltimore affair, by the historian Daniel Kevles of Yale, but her aim was not to write a thinly disguised rehash of that painful episode. Instead, Ms. Goodman says, she wanted to write about character and motives and ambiguity. Her book, she said, is about a family -- a professional family, the family of a lab -- that was, in the end, destroyed.
Dr. Jules Hirsch, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University, provided evidence from studies by others that followed thousands of people for years, keeping track of who lost weight, who kept it off, who became ill and who died. Repeatedly, investigators reported that fat people who lost weight and kept it off had more heart disease and a higher death rate than people whose weight never changed. ''It all does tend to indicate that weight loss is not associated with lower mortality but is actually associated with higher mortality,'' said Dr. Katherine Flegal, an epidemiologist at the National Center for Health Statistics. But, she and others noted, the limitation of the studies is that they cannot distinguish between people who lost weight because they went on diets and those who lost weight because they became ill. That, said investigators at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, is why the institute is recruiting 5,000 overweight people with diabetes for its study and asking how weight loss will affect their health. The 12 year study, directed by Dr. Rena Wing at Brown Medical School and Dr. Xavier Pi-Sunyer at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York, is the largest study on weight loss ever conducted, Dr. Wing said.
When he first came into office, in 1993, President Clinton asked federal regulators to assess whether the drug was safe and if it should be sold in this country. Dr. David A. Kessler, who was commissioner of the F.D.A. from October 1990 until March 1997, prevailed upon Roussel-Uclaf to donate its patent to the Population Council, which wanted to sponsor clinical trials in the United States and find a company to produce and market the drug. In May of 1994, Roussel-Uclaf donated its patent. ''We really did think that we should have a chance to evaluate the drug,'' Dr. Kessler said. ''We didn't think that politics should get in the way of that.'' Four years ago, the Population Council presented its data on the drug's safety and efficacy to an advisory committee of the health agency, which recommended the drug be approved for marketing in this country. But the Population Council still had no one willing to manufacture the drug. As a result, the agency could not issue final approval.
Ms. Pearson said so many women had told her the drugs made them feel better that she assumed it was true. ''Even if you train yourself to think, 'placebo effect, anecdotal evidence,' if you hear it often enough you begin to think that maybe it's true for some women, somewhere,'' she said. Until last summer, the drugs were among the most widely prescribed medicines, used by millions of women. Then, in July, investigators for the Women's Health Initiative said they had halted the study because the hormones were conferring health risks -- slightly more heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and breast cancer. The drug being tested was Wyeth's Prempro, a combination of estrogen and progestins that was popular with women and their doctors. With the news last summer, Prempro's sales dropped by 50 percent. In January, the Food and Drug Administration required that all of the 20 or so estrogen- and progestin-containing drugs being prescribed for symptoms of menopause carry a so-called black box warning of their health risks.
''It may not be the pill you are taking, but the fact that you are the kind of person who keeps taking pills.'' Although he said the nurses' and other observational studies overestimated the benefits of estrogen, Dr. Rossouw said it was too soon to say what the randomized study would find. The plans for the initiative's study called for more than 27,000 women from 50 to 79 to be followed for eight to 12 years, unless evidence emerged that hormone therapy was overwhelmingly beneficial or overwhelmingly harmful. With about three years to go, neither case has occurred, and the trial continues. The women taking estrogen seem to have slightly more heart attacks and strokes. The study directors notified them of that finding, but the effects are too small to halt the trial, its monitoring board found. Other recent randomized studies with women who already had heart disease found that estrogen increased the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes. Women who had early Alzheimer's were not helped by taking estrogen.
Now, some scientists even say low radiation doses may be beneficial. They theorize that these doses protect against cancer by activating cells' natural defense mechanisms. As evidence, they cite studies, like one in Canada of tuberculosis patients who had multiple chest X-rays and one of nuclear workers in the United States. The tuberculosis patients, some analyses said, had fewer cases of breast cancer than would be expected and the nuclear workers had a lower mortality rate than would be expected. Dr. Boice said these studies were flawed by statistical pitfalls, and when a committee of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement evaluated this and other studies on beneficial effects, it was not convinced. The group, headed by Dr. Upton of New Jersey, wrote that the data ''do not exclude'' the hypothesis. But, it added, ''the prevailing evidence has generally been interpreted as insufficient to support this view.'' In the meantime, the regulatory agencies are at a stalemate, continuing to disagree on radiation standards. And the committee reports and committee meetings on radiation standards go on.
In 1983, there were 42.16 women per 100,000 with cancers that had spread to the underarm lymph nodes or had spread as a continuous tumor to the chest wall or muscle. These usually have a poor prognosis. In 1998, there were 38.24 per 100,000. The number of women with breast cancers with the worst prognosis, those that spread to other organs, had been fairly constant in the years before mammography was introduced, and that trend did not change after the introduction of mammography. The problem, Dr. Kramer said, is the numbers of cancers found early and found later, corrected for size and age of the population. If screening worked perfectly, every cancer found early would correspond to one fewer cancer found later. That, he said, did not happen. Mammography, instead has resulted in a huge new population of women with early stage cancer but without a corresponding decline in the numbers of women with advanced cancer.
Some riders have been drawn by the celebrity of Lance Armstrong, the rider who has won the Tour de France five times in a row and will try to set a record with a sixth victory this month. ''Any business that is related to the cycling industry has seen what we call the Lance effect,'' said Chris Carmichael, Armstrong's coach and the founder of a company that coaches people to improve their bicycling performance. Others are aging baby boomers who, tired of other joint-pounding activities, are ''seeking out the smooth comfort of riding on a road,'' said Marc Sani , publisher of Bike Retailer and Industry News. They bring with them disposable income and a fondness for specialized equipment: Custom bicycles, which can cost from $3,000 to $9,000, are a fast-growing market. In the new world of cycling, technology has transformed the experience. Lightweight bicycles are just the beginning. Riders use small computers that clip onto the handlebars, measuring cadence, gear, speed, distance and time, allowing them to monitor their efforts with exquisite precision. High-performance bicycles have gearshifts and brakes on the handlebars, and lightweight aerodynamic wheels. They also have front-wheel-gripping forks, seat posts and handlebars made of carbon fiber, which is lightweight and dampens road vibrations while allowing precise handling.
Professor Merges, the patent expert at Berkeley, said scientists should not be surprised when patients feel cheated. ''It would be hypocritical for a researcher to say, 'I'm outraged that patients are interested in the commercialization of their tissue' while at the same time the researcher has his name on 15 patents,'' Professor Merges said. ''There's a sort of mercantilization going on in medicine.'' The risk, said Professor Greely of Stanford, is that patients will refuse to participate in genetic research, fearing that they will be exploited. ''You don't want research subjects to feel cheated and embittered and betrayed,'' he said. ''In the long run, for research with human subjects to survive, those human subjects have to feel that they've been treated fairly.''
Dr. Cooper said he was not surprised that the group of very sick patients in the federal study were not helped by the operation. ''These patients should not have been operated on, in my opinion,'' he said. Others disagreed. ''We were surprised,'' Dr. Make said. ''We would not have predicted that they would have had an excess mortality.''
Asked why a healthy transplanted heart would need to grow new cells, Dr. Anversa said the new heart was not necessarily so healthy. ''The heart is subjected to a tremendous amount of stress,'' he said. Typically, a donated heart is stored for hours before it is transplanted. And, he said, women tend to have smaller hearts than men, a fact that could strain the female hearts as they tried to supply blood to the larger body of a man. The female hearts may need new cells to replace ones that were injured or died in the process of transplantation and they may need to grow larger to meet the new demands on them. Now, Dr. Anversa said, the challenge is to learn where the cells that colonize the heart come from and how to direct the process so that the heart can repair itself. Dr. Irving L. Weissman, a stem cell researcher at Stanford, suggested another possible way to repair hearts. ''If we knew there was a cell outside the heart that could help regenerate the heart,'' he said, ''we might be able to transplant it into the heart.''
Most researchers agree that there are tumors whose fate appears to have been sealed at the time they were found. Yet today that grim reality is discovered only after the fact. A woman will be treated for her cancer with surgery and, often chemotherapy, only to have the cancer recur a few years later, in her bones or brain or liver. ''If you take out a small tumor and get metastatic disease a few years later, chances are that the metastasis was already there when you took out the primary tumor,'' said Dr. Steven Goodman, a biostatistician in the department of oncology at Johns Hopkins University. ''So taking out the primary tumor did nothing.'' The cancer had already microscopically spread. The gene activity studies also might help researchers answer another pressing question: Would finding the cancer even earlier make a difference? Do tumors start off lethal or do they grow into lethality, acquiring mutations over time that enable them to kill? And if they grow into lethality, when does the crucial transformation occur?
For example, several studies have suggested a link between Alzheimer's and cholesterol, which is produced by the brain, as well as by the liver, raising the possibility that statins, the drugs that lower cholesterol, might hold Alzheimer's at bay. Other researchers have hypothesized that medications that reduce inflammation, a hallmark of Alzheimer's in areas of the brain where cells are dying, might prove useful. Still another idea is that Alzheimer's may be set off when someone who is predisposed to it receives another ''hit'' to the brain, for example from high blood pressure, reduced blood flow, a stroke or high cholesterol levels. If that is the case, a generation of middle-aged people who have had access to effective drugs for treating blood pressure and high cholesterol may already be receiving some protection. Researchers have also found the first intimations that they may someday be able to reverse Alzheimer's destruction of the brain.
Now, no longer sure that I have a long and healthy old age to look forward to, I peer at my parents as they grow old and wonder what will be my fate. Can you change the genetic roulette? Will all those years of exercise and weight lifting prevent me from shrinking a few inches in height? Will frequent tests for Paget's disease, a degenerative bone disorder, help me to detect it early, if I get it, and avoid the hearing loss that has plagued my father? How much of our future is in our own hands, or the hands of medical researchers avidly looking for causes and cures of illnesses, and how much was predetermined at birth? My children, meanwhile, are looking at my husband and me and seeing their personalities and their futures. My daughter thinks she inherited her exuberance from me. My son is convinced that his reserve was a bequest of his father. I told my daughter that my cholesterol levels were getting out of control. Oh, no, she said, that means it will happen to her.
In randomized studies, participants are randomly assigned to have treatments or not, and the outcomes in the two groups are compared. The advantage is that treatments are not chosen by individuals but assigned by a figurative toss of a coin. But there are many questions that such studies cannot answer, because they would be infeasible or unethical, among them, whether heavy drinking leads to liver disease. With hormone replacement, the conclusion from studies that followed hundreds of thousands of women for years was that women who used it were healthier, with less heart disease and longer lives. In contrast, the emerging results of randomized studies are not finding any such effects. ''This is a bizarre time in history,'' Dr. Robins said. If ever there was a situation where he would have believed data from observational studies, he said, it was with hormone replacement therapy, because the studies were so well conducted.
Doctors discovered that they simply could not perform the delicate movements of microsurgery without making large incisions and putting their hands directly in patients' bodies. Robots could allow them to get around that restriction. Surgeons say that while there is intense interest in doing heart bypass surgery with robots, the methods also could be used for other kinds of microsurgery, like sewing fallopian tubes or working on blood vessels in the brain. Doctors caution, however, that robotic surgery has barely begun. The patient at Ohio State was part of a scientific study to determine whether one part of a heart bypass operation -- cutting away an artery in the chest to be used to reroute blood around a blockage in a coronary artery -- can be done as well with the robot as with a surgeon's hands. In this study, the doctors open a small porthole in the patient's chest after the robot cuts the artery and use their hands to sew the artery onto the beating heart.
Those who tried to install Vista on their own would agree. Dr. Nancy Anthracite, a family physician in Washington, needed endless hours of help from a group of Vista enthusiasts who call themselves the Hardhats and volunteer their time. Getting started with Vista was so daunting, Dr. Anthracite said, that even when the V.A. demonstrated its program at medical meetings, almost no none of those in attendance wanted to use it on their own. ''You go to meetings and they show you things doctors can do with Vista and everyone's going , 'Wow, wow, wow,''' Dr. Anthracite said. ''But no one installs it.'' So for three years, Medicare and its contractors worked to make the program easier to use. They even gave it a new name, VistaOffice, to signify that was intended for small-office practices, not the huge V.A. system. Some, including Dr. Toppenberg, decided not to wait for the August release of the new program. Last year, he learned that he could get the unmodified V.A. version of Vista and decided to try it.
Certainly, the last gulf war was stressful, Dr. Wray said, even before hostilities began. ''Not knowing what is going to happen, waiting for it to happen is very stressful,'' she said. ''Just sitting in a hot tank in a desert waiting is substantially stressful.'' But researchers' conclusions that they could not fully explain the illnesses only fed conspiracy theories. Some doctors and veterans held fast to a variety of convictions: the syndrome was a reaction to toxins in vaccines, or a reaction to infectious microbes, or a reaction to a drug the troops took to protect against nerve gas. Doctors opened medical clinics where they diagnosed disorders and treated veterans, using expensive tests and drugs. ''A small number of doctors are absolutely convinced that they understand the gulf war syndrome and know what to do about it,'' Dr. Bailar said. ''They don't always agree,'' he said of those doctors, ''but, boy, do they know what to do.''
A new analysis of combined data from two parts of a large federal study of hormone therapy has found that women in their 50s do not appear to have an increased heart attack risk if they take the drugs. But it also found that women in their 60s and 70s who still had hot flashes and night sweats were at increased risk for heart attacks, even if they were not taking hormones. And if these women took hormone therapy, their risk was higher still. ''The main indication now for hormone therapy is hot flashes and night sweats,'' said Dr. Jacques Rossouw, a researcher for the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute who directed the federal study, the Women's Health Initiative. ''This says that if you are older than 60, you should not take it.'' That observation needs additional study to confirm and understand it, Dr. Rossouw said. ''It's quite new and unexpected,'' he added. Because this group of older women with menopausal symptoms was not specified before the studies began, the researchers described their analysis as exploratory rather than definitive.
''What's off-pump?'' Jay Spear, 60, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., asked. Dr. Mehmet C. Oz, director of the Cardiovascular Institute at Columbia-Presbyterian, performed Mr. Spear's bypass surgery with a heart-lung machine on March 4. Dr. Richard Brockman, 55, of New York, a psychiatrist, said he did not consider the brain injury problem when he learned that he had to have bypass surgery. ''I just knew I didn't want a major invasive procedure,'' Dr. Brockman said. ''I was thinking more about infection and complications and just being weakened.'' He had his off-pump surgery in October with Dr. Oz. ''Once I heard, 'Dr. Oz,' and I heard, 'minimally invasive,' I said, 'Let's do it,' '' Dr. Brockman recalled. But for cardiologists and surgeons, the specter of brain injury has been an agony, a worry that they may save the heart but subtly damage the mind. Early on, before they turned to surgery on beating hearts, many surgeons were convinced that the bypass machine was part of the problem.
Until recently, a patient like Carolyn E. Hoard would never have been told she was progressing toward Alzheimer's disease. A 61-year-old mental health counselor in Kittanning, Pa., she reported nothing more than a mild loss of memory, particularly when it came to recalling what someone had said in conversation a few minutes ago. Her first neurologist told her she was fine. But the memory lapses persisted, and Ms. Hoard went to a second neurologist, who gave her the news she had been dreading: she suffered from mild cognitive impairment, usually the first sign of Alzheimer's disease. The term is new, having entered the vocabulary of memory specialists in the late 1990's. Now more and more doctors, combining tools as sophisticated as brain imaging and as simple as a short test of word recall, are making the diagnosis. Researchers and drug companies say the new category will enable them to track the progression of Alzheimer's disease and understand it better. They are already testing a wide array of treatments in these patients -- from vitamins to hormones to new drugs as well as drugs already approved for Alzheimer's.
IT seemed so clear a decade ago. Hormone replacement therapy would protect women's hearts after menopause. After all, their risk of heart disease rises in middle age, around the time their ovaries stop making estrogen. And there was indirect evidence that the drug was working: women who chose to take it lived longer and had less heart disease than those who did not. There even was a biological reason. Estrogen makes a woman's total cholesterol level drop; it reduces the levels of LDL cholesterol, the bad actor, while raising levels of HDL cholesterol, which protects against heart disease. ''All the elements were in place for estrogen to protect against heart disease,'' said Dr. Deborah Grady, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California in San Francisco. She and other experts were so persuaded that they wrote a set of widely adopted guidelines for the American College of Physicians recommending that women at high risk of heart disease take estrogen after menopause. But new data show that even the best-intentioned analysis can go astray relying on indirect evidence.
A major study published last week, for example, gave some researchers pause. Nearly 49,000 women were randomly assigned to follow a low fat diet or their regular diet for eight years while researchers kept track of their rates of breast cancer, colon cancer and heart disease. Not only did the diets have no effect on these diseases, they also had no effect on the women's weights. So, some ask, why expect that a small change, like replacing whole milk with skim, would affect children's weights? ''I don't want to say there is no such remedy that will ever work,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Friedman, an obesity researcher at Rockefeller University. ''But the burden should be on those who want to impose them to show they work. To my knowledge, no one has ever done this.'' It's not that no one has tried. In the 1990's, the National Institutes of Health sponsored two large, rigorous studies asking whether weight gain in children could be prevented by doing everything that obesity fighters say should be done in schools -- greatly expand physical education, make cafeteria meals more nutritious and less fattening, teach students about proper nutrition and the need to exercise, and involve the parents. One study, an eight-year, $20 million project sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, followed 1,704 third graders in 41 elementary schools in the Southwest, where students were mostly Native Americans, a group that is at high risk for obesity. The schools were randomly divided into two groups, one subject to intensive intervention, the other left alone. Researchers determined, beginning at grade five, if the children in the intervention schools were thinner than those in the schools that served as a control group.
''Everyone was hoping the study would show which was better,'' Dr. Flum said. ''And everyone was surprised by the tremendous number of crossovers in both directions,'' he added, referring to the large number of participants who changed from surgery to waiting and vice versa. That muddied the data. Sciatica tends to run in families and occurs when the soft gel-like material inside a spinal disk protrudes through the outer lining of the disk like a bubble on a bicycle tire. That compresses and inflames a nerve root that forms the sciatic nerve. The resulting pain can feel like a burning fork in the buttocks, Dr. Weinstein said. Or it can be a searing pain down the back of a leg. The pain can be so intense that some people cannot walk. Some cannot sit. Some, Dr. Weinstein said, ''can barely crawl.'' The operation is quick and generally effective, Dr. Garfin said. It involves gently pushing the compressed nerve root away from the herniated disk. Then the surgeon makes an incision in the disk and deflates it. The nerve returns to its normal position, the inflammation goes away, and the pain often disappears.
One study enrolled patients who had antibodies to the Lyme disease microorganism, Borrelia burgdorferi, an indicator that they had been infected. The other enrolled patients who no longer had antibodies but had had a documented case of Lyme disease. Half the patients in both studies received an intravenous antibiotic, ceftriaxone, for a month, followed by oral doxycycline for 60 days; the others received dummy medications. The question was, Would this intensive antibiotic treatment make the patients better? The studies were meant to enroll 260 patients, but they ended early, after enrolling just 129 patients, because an independent committee overseeing them said it had become clear that the antibiotics were no more effective than the placebos. Dr. Shapiro said he was not surprised. Although a small group of doctors and patients insist that symptoms like fatigue and memory loss after a bout with Lyme disease are due to chronic infection with the disease organism, those symptoms are very common among the general public, leading Dr. Shapiro and others to believe there is some other cause.
Dr. Lanza said his group analyzed the health of its cattle clones because it was worried that Congress would ban all human cloning, not only cloning for reproduction but also cloning to develop cell lines for use as therapies. Advanced Cell Technology has said it wanted to do this so-called therapeutic cloning to create cloned embryos of adult patients from which they could obtain replacement cells. For example, they might be able to grow pancreas cells to treat people with diabetes. ''These anticloning bills were fueled by scientists in our desire to portray human cloning as dangerous and irresponsible,'' Dr. Lanza said. Now, he added, ''it's important to put some science in here, some reality.'' But some critics of human cloning say that they are not persuaded by Dr. Lanza's argument that clones can be normal and healthy. Dr. Rudolph Jaenisch, a biology professor at the Whitehead Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said, ''You have to define what normal is.''
''I'm not convinced this is part of every doctor's training or that everyone is ready to make it part of mainstream medicine,'' Dr. Roberts said. ''You have to work with athletes a while to figure out how to do it and how to do it well.'' ''The easy way out is to say, 'Don't exercise,' '' said Dr. Richard Steadman, an orthopedic surgeon in Vail, Colo., and founder of the Steadman Hawkins Research Foundation, which studies the origins and treatment of sports injuries. That advice, he added, ''is safe and you probably will have healing over time.'' But, he said, ''if the injury is not severe, resting it will probably prolong recovery.'' Medical researchers say that they only gradually realized the importance of exercising when injured. A few decades ago, Dr. Mininder Kocher, a sports medicine specialist and orthopedic surgeon at Children's Hospital Boston, said doctors were so intent on forcing hurt athletes to rest that they would put injured knees or elbows or limbs in a cast for two to three months.
The 19th century saw, for example, the emergence of the Rev. Sylvester Graham, a promoter of vegetarianism for whom the Graham cracker was named. Graham insisted that people could rise above hunger and cravings if they would just stop being slaves to their stomachs. His followers favored fresh fruits and vegetables, grown without fertilizers, and made bran bread. They established ''physiological boardinghouses'' where people could live the Graham way. Skeptics were scathing. Dinner at a Graham house, they said, featured delicacies like ''straggling radishes,'' ''a soggy bunch of asparagus'' and ''corpses of potatoes,'' washed down with ''a tumbler of cold water.'' Low-carbohydrate diets emerged in 1825 in ''The Physiology of Taste,'' a book by a French lawyer, Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, that was a sensation across the Atlantic. He knew some would object to his prescription but, he warned, they would suffer the consequences: '''Oh Heavens!' all you readers of both sexes will cry out, 'Oh Heavens above! But what a wretch the Professor is! Here in a single word he forbids us everything we must love, those little white rolls from Limet, and Achard's cakes, and those cookies. He doesn't even leave us potatoes or macaroni! Who would have thought this of a lover of good food who seemed so pleasant?'
Keith Orr thought he would surprise his doctor when he came for a checkup. His doctor had told him to have a weight-loss operation to reduce the amount of food his stomach could hold, worried because Mr. Orr, at 6 feet 2 inches, weighed 278 pounds. He also had a blood sugar level so high he was on the verge of diabetes and a strong family history of early death from heart attacks. And Mr. Orr, who is 44, had already had a heart attack in 1998 when he was 35. But Mr. Orr had a secret plan. He had been quietly dieting and exercising for four months and lost 45 pounds. He envisioned himself proudly telling his doctor what he had done, sure his tests would show a huge drop in his blood sugar and cholesterol levels. He planned to confess that he had also stopped taking all of his prescription drugs for heart disease.
Dr. Bresalier, who is a professor and chairman of the department of gastrointestinal medicine and nutrition at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, explained that the polyp results emerged in data analyses only a few weeks ago, showing that the study was ''substantially positive.'' He has not yet presented the results to other scientists for review. The study was paid for by Merck. The company declined to comment on the polyp data except to say that they would be presented at the American Gasteroenterological Association's meeting in May and would be published. But Dr. Bresalier said that while the final analyses were not in, it was clear that markedly fewer patients developed precancerous polyps while taking Vioxx and that no other study had shown such pronounced effects in patients like those in this study, who previously had such polyps and were at risk for developing more. Most colon cancer starts with polyps, although most polyps do not become cancers.
''As a physician, I could respect that,'' Dr. Goodman said, adding that he would offer those people doxycycline. Lyme disease researchers emphasized, however, that previous studies had shown that most people with the infection get better on their own, without antibiotics. And while a small percentage develop serious symptoms, like arthritis or heart disorders, even the vast majority of these get better, the researchers said. Dr. Raymond Dattwyler, director of the Lyme Disease Center at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said the typical Lyme disease patient has a rash but no other symptoms, takes an antibiotic and is cured. The two other studies released yesterday, financed by the National  Institutes of Health, addressed the question of how to treat people who had Lyme disease and later developed symptoms like fatigue, aches and pains, and memory loss. Both were conducted by Dr. Mark S. Klempner of Boston University School of Medicine and his colleagues.
Troubled by the lack of compelling evidence, as he sees it, for off-pump surgery, Dr. Hernandez began turning from it. ''I can't see an advantage,'' he said. ''It's a much harder operation technically. We finally succeeded in creating an operation that's harder on the surgeon than it is on the patient.'' Dr. Oz and Dr. Rose of Columbia also have lost their enthusiasm for off-pump surgery. ''I was one of the first to start doing a lot of off-pump surgery,'' Dr. Oz said. ''It made intuitive sense to me that you would avoid pumphead.'' But, he said, that has not been demonstrated. At best, he added, there is a minuscule statistical improvement on psychological tests of learning and memory. ''As a practicing physician,'' he asked, ''if it takes me 10,000 patients to find a difference, do I care?'' Why do the numbers of off-pump operations keep climbing? ''Some surgeons use this as a marketing tool,'' Dr. Oz said.
But for most women, many experts said, the message is clear. ''Women take hormones for all sorts of reasons, but the main reason is to reduce hot flashes and sleep disturbances at menopause,'' said Dr. Barbara Alving, the study's director. But once they start, many become convinced it has helped their quality of life and are reluctant to stop taking them, she added. The study, Dr. Alving said, shows that when it comes to quality of life, ''there really is no difference.'' Wyeth said the study was unlikely to have much effect on women's decisions to use or not to use hormones, because the study subjects were not typical hormone users: they did not have severe symptoms of menopause; and their quality-of-life scores, on average, were high, indicating that no treatment would be likely to raise them much more. The findings, said Doug Petkus, a Wyeth spokesman, ''are unlikely to have clinical meaning and should be interpreted with caution.''
But the research is detecting measures of athletic fitness and, as a consequence, the studies raise ethical questions. Should people be told if they have a gene that will prevent them from ever getting aerobically fit? Should coaches be able to do genetic testing of athletes to learn who is most likely to improve, and who has the genes to be a future star? Some of the seminal work began quietly more than 20 years ago. Dr. Claude Bouchard, who now directs the Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University, had previously studied obese people by putting them in a metabolic ward where he could keep track of what they ate and how many calories they burned. What would happen, he asked, if he did the same thing with exercise, asking people to train in an exercise laboratory, where he could watch them and measure their efforts? Some exercise physiologists and sports trainers had assumed that people who said they exercised but never increased their fitness were cheating, either dissembling about the amount of exercise they did or deceiving themselves about how hard they worked when they exercised. But Dr. Bouchard wondered if that was true.
''It was totally comfortable to believe that low-fat, high-fiber diets would be beneficial,'' said one public health expert, Dr. Gilbert S. Omenn, executive vice president for medical affairs at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the research. ''Well, here we are. There's not a shred of evidence from these trials.'' Dr. Barnett Kramer, deputy director of the division of cancer prevention at the National Cancer Institute, said the surprising results showed ''the need to rigorously put belief systems to the test,'' especially  ''when you are making recommendations to literally hundreds of millions of people.'' Public health experts said fiber might nonetheless play another role long attributed to it: reducing the risk of heart disease and diabetes. It may also help prevent diverticulitis and diverticulosis, ailments that entail the formation of sacs in the wall of the intestine. But some researchers say the latest studies show that it is time to abandon the idea that fiber can help prevent colon cancer.
I think that plan should not be a minimal sort of ''safety net for the poor'' plan, but neither should it be one that would cover what every American would be willing and able to pay for. I like to think of it as a multitiered system where every American has basic coverage and people have options to buy more, not subsidized by taxes but with their own after-tax dollars. The individual plans could decide if they want a co-payment, such as $10 for each prescription or a co-payment for an office visit. I don't operate at the level of trying to specify details. I try to see what is the broad strategy, what is the broad vision that we want to bring to this. I'm trying to get across two points: universal coverage for a plan, but one that is not completely egalitarian. I think we are hung up with the idea that everything we do in health care must be egalitarian, and we wind up with a very nonegalitarian system. What I'm arguing for is some kind of middle ground.  Q.  What happens now to the uninsured? Aren't they simply doing without the most basic health care?  A.  No. The truth is we do provide health care for everyone one way or another. We have poverty clinics, we have county hospitals.
''People don't want to hear that.'' AIDS at 20 Previous articles in this series included articles on current research on new treatments and vaccines, the effects of AIDS on New York City, the lives of AIDS doctors, and the recent increases in risky sexual behavior among gay men. Later articles will examine the lives of teenagers with AIDS and the effects of AIDS on the arts. A special section devoted to AIDS is available online: www.nytimes.com/aids AIDS at 20 / Where It All Started
As of August, however, the guidelines have changed. ''We recommend starting patients on metformin immediately,'' said Dr. David M. Nathan, who directs the diabetes center at Massachusetts General Hospital and is a member of the group that formulated the new guidelines. ''Don't start with lifestyle alone, even for newly diagnosed people. Most end up failing the lifestyle recommendations.'' He added: ''What classically happened was that the patients would take three months and try to diet. It wouldn't work. Then they joined a health club. It didn't work. Then they take another three months and try some more. By the time they were on effective therapy, they had had diabetes for years and years.'' In developing the new guidelines, the group reasoned that the consequences of untreated diabetes -- which can include heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, blindness and amputations -- are too dire to allow high blood sugar levels to persist.
A woman will be given written instructions on the pill's use and its side effects, which can include bleeding and cramping, headaches, vomiting or diarrhea, and her doctor must sign a statement saying they have read the instructions and will comply with them exactly. The woman must also agree to have a surgical abortion if the pills do not succeed. A woman first takes mifepristone, which blocks the action of progesterone, a hormone required to maintain a pregnancy, and 36 to 48 hours later  takes a second drug, misoprostol, which makes the uterus contract, expelling the fetal tissue. In clinical trials, the drug combination failed to result in complete abortion in about 5 percent of cases. The F.D.A. also required that the Population Council, a nonprofit group that holds the United States patent to mifepristone, keep track of how many women suffer serious side effects and the number of cases in which the pill fails to induce abortion. The council will also audit doctors to see whether they and the women taking the drug are signing the patient agreement.
''It's a whole lot easier to just go ahead and screen,'' Dr. Black said. Investigators say there are no ready answers on who should be tested, with what test and when. In an ideal world, they say, patients would consider the risks and benefits of each test and make an informed decision with the guidance of a wise doctor. But instead, they say, hurried doctors seldom spend much time discussing the tests and few patients ever question whether a test may do more harm than good. The result is that even tests whose benefits are accepted, like Pap tests for cancer of the cervix, are overused, with many women having it annually when once every three years would suffice. But people bring their own values to bear when weighing evidence. For example, Donna Berry, a registered nurse who lives in Houston, said she started having mammograms when she was 45 -- she is now 59 -- even though she was well aware of a heated debate over whether they helped women in their 40's. For Mrs. Berry, the test is worthwhile if there is the slightest chance that it might catch a cancer that can be cured.
Such responses are being repeated throughout the country as more and more radiologists begin advertising  the lung cancer screening test. The procedure is done with a powerful new X-ray machine, a spiral CT scanner, which can detect tumors many times smaller than those found with a conventional chest X-ray. Cancer experts agree that there is an urgent need to improve the prospects for patients with lung cancer. But it is unclear whether more people will be harmed than helped by the test because the scanner's effectiveness has never been rigorously tested. One early study has found that 9 of every 10 patients who have suspicious test findings will not have cancer -- but they will have to have additional expensive tests, and sometimes surgery, to find that out. For the rest there are three possibilities. Some may be cured when surgeons snip out their tumors. Others may have tumors that may turn out not to have been dangerous after all, but they still would have undergone treatments as though their lives were threatened. And still others may have tiny tumors that turn out to be incurable despite the treatments.
OVER the past century medicine has wrought so many miracles that progress has come to seem inexorable. A discovery is made, a cure is found. Next, please. But the truth is that medical science, like all science, does not proceed from ignorance to enlightenment in a straight line. Indeed, it is more accurately described, in the words of the philosopher Miquel de Unamuno, as ''a cemetery of dead ideas,'' with one seeming truth being thrown out for another that fits better with the latest research. A particularly painful example may be occurring right now. For years, women over 40 years old were told that a yearly mammogram could find breast cancer early enough to save them from death. This was medical dogma; it was the truth. But in the early 1990's, doubts grew about whether the test helped women in their 40's, and now some experts say they question whether it saves anyone.
Dr. Burlington said that Wyeth expected to participate in the health institutes' meeting in October. But he added, ''We don't have an agenda and we don't have an invitation as yet.''
Bitter words became a feature of medical meetings and medical writings, said Dr. Barron H. Lerner, a historian of medicine at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and the author of ''The Breast Cancer Wars,'' published last year. He notes that one predeterminist, Dr. Maurice M. Black, a New York pathologist, would regularly decry the ''power of ritual vested interests and wishful thinking over reason.'' Eventually, the early detection camp won the hearts and minds of doctors and the public. One reason, Dr. Lerner said, was a distaste for the predeterminists' fatalism. But, Dr. Lerner said, the early detection message, in many ways, was overstated and the optimism excessive. ''The American Cancer Society and other groups, earnestly trying to get the public concerned about breast cancer, needed to find a hopeful message,'' Dr. Lerner said. ''They settled on early detection. ''Unfortunately, they painted too black and white a picture -- many cancers discovered on breast examination were neither early nor curable.''
After monitoring more than 2,500 breast cancer patients for 20 years, researchers have concluded that women fare just as well with an operation that removes the cancerous lump as they do by having the entire breast removed. Some medical experts said they hoped the findings, by researchers in the United States and Italy, might end a simmering debate over whether it is really safe to offer a lumpectomy, rather than a mastectomy, to most women with breast cancer. One study, at the University of Pittsburgh, involved 1,851 women and compared mastectomies with lumpectomies. The other, at the European Institute of Oncology, in Milan, involved 701 women and compared radical mastectomies, which removed more tissue, with a more extensive form of lumpectomy. The studies, both described in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, have reported similar results in years past. But some experts said then that they would not be convinced until more time had gone by. Among them, many thought that mastectomies were better for women with relatively large tumors, aggressive cancers or disease that had already spread to the underarm lymph nodes.
The next step was for hospitals to compete by offering even lower prices to insurers, not so much to get business but to avoid losing it. Hospitals that tried to hold the line lost business. Then their revenues dried up. ''Now the spiral gets deeper,'' said James D. Shelton, the chairman and chief executive of Triad Hospitals Inc., a chain of for-profit hospitals and surgery centers. Mr. Shelton said that he knew the uninsured had been victims of this situation. But, he said, what are hospitals supposed to do? ''There's a limit to what these people can pay,'' Mr. Shelton said. ''But what is the greater good -- if the hospital goes bankrupt and it's the only provider in the community or if you try to collect every bill you can within reason and the person goes bankrupt?'' At New York-Presbyterian Hospital in New York, Dr. Herbert Pardes, the president and chief executive, said that so few patients were paying undiscounted rates and the discounted rates were so low that it was becoming increasingly difficult to provide free care for poor people who could not pay.
Ask any diabetes specialist whether people can protect themselves from Type 2 diabetes through diet and exercise and the answer will be a resounding yes. It has been shown three times, in studies in three countries, one of them the United States. Weight loss and exercise can do more than just stave off diabetes, diabetes specialists will tell you. They can result in lower blood pressure, lower levels of cholesterol, less sleep apnea, more vigor and, in general, a better life. But if you ask how likely it is that people at high risk of diabetes will follow the advice to diet and exercise, or about using a drug instead, you will get a different sort of answer. It is a classic conundrum in medicine: if doctors know that patients can help themselves without taking drugs, but they also know that patients are not likely to follow this advice, what should they do?
''They work 365 days a year except for leap year, when they work 366 days,'' Dr. Schatten said. ''They have lab meetings at 6:30 every morning except Sunday, when they have them at 8.'' Few would venture into the cloning arena if the science was not so promising, researchers say. Of course, they say, there is a long way to go from stem cells to therapy. ''It's going to take a lot of work,'' said Dr. Ronald McKay, a stem cell researcher at the National Institutes of Health. ''But we want this to work -- it's not a theory. My technical and professional judgment tells me this is really important.'' Dr. Kass, however, says that cloning and extracting stem cells from the embryos is not the only way to do such work. A majority of the President's Council on Bioethics called for a moratorium on cloning for research, he said, and the council recently suggested other ways of getting stem cells that could develop into the desired tissue types and that would match a patient's own cells ''without these violations and moral hazards.''
Dr. Robert Lanza, the scientist at Advanced Cell Technology who tried to generate cloned human embryos, agreed that getting stem cells is a challenge in itself. ''I know some in the field who have tried with dozens and dozens of embryos, without success,'' he said. What about animal research? Can scientists take embryonic stem cells from mouse blastocysts, for example, and use them to cure diseases in mice? Not yet. Questions remain, including how to induce stem cells to grow into the precise type of cell needed, then how to persuade those cells to function properly. For example, what if islet cells, derived from stem cells, are inserted into a diabetic's pancreas and then go into overdrive, churning out too much insulin? Once the cells are in place, they can't be plucked out. It will take years and much federal money, many predict, before therapeutic cloning has a chance of succeeding. For now, Dr. Schultz said, the promise is all in the distant future. Therapeutic cloning, he said, ''is literally in an embryonic stage.''
Correction:  January 2, 2005, Sunday  A front-page article on Dec. 5 about the weight-loss drug rimonabant, which has generated public excitement even though it has not been approved for sale, reversed the generic and brand names of a drug now on the market for obesity. Its brand name is Xenical and its generic name is orlistat.
But equity, once again, depends on who is asked. ''Fairness is only an issue when you talk about benefits,'' Dr. Fost said. And the benefits, he added, are largely unknown. Correction:  February 25, 2005, Friday  A front-page article on Monday about debate over a proposed federal recommendation that all newborn babies be screened for 29 rare diseases misidentified a type of acid that can form in the blood of premature babies. It is carbonic acid (formed when carbon dioxide in the lungs combines with water in the blood), not carbolic acid.
Moreover, it is not at all certain the Food and Drug Administration would accept any of the currently proposed surrogate markers for aging. In the meantime, the patent clocks on Elixir Pharmaceuticals and other companies' drugs will be ticking. Dr. Guarente has a different strategy, he said, based on the assumption that an anti-aging drug should protect against diseases that occur with age, like cancer, heart disease and diabetes. So, find a disease -- any disease -- Dr. Guarente said, and show that the putative anti-aging drug works against it. Then get the drug on the market as a treatment specific for that illness. The F.D.A. forbids companies from advertising or promoting drugs for any but approved uses. But doctors can prescribe drugs for other uses at their own discretion. And researchers could publish studies giving strong hints that the drug is, if not a fountain of youth, then a first step.
Thirty years ago, there were no good ways to lower cholesterol. Diets had a small effect at best, and the best drug available, cholestyramine, was a grainy powder that patients mixed with juice. It tasted like sand -- one patient likened taking it to drinking Miami Beach -- and using it was so unpleasant that it was reserved for the most severe cases. Now there are pills, cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins that are remarkably safe and effective, Dr. Gordon said. Tens of millions of Americans are taking them. In the 12 months ended in September 2002, there were 116 million dispensed prescriptions of statins -- new prescriptions and refills -- in the United States, according to IMS Health, a health information company. The decline in smoking rates did not markedly affect heart disease and stroke death rates, said Dr. Lee Goldman, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. Smokers were dying early of lung cancer and lung disease, taking them out of the pool of people who might die of cardiovascular diseases.
Dr. Sangram Sisodia, chairman of the department of neurobiology, pharmacology and physiology at the University of Chicago, said that when he first heard of the Amgen result, he dismissed it, saying, ''It's junk. It has been junk after junk for 12 years.'' But Dr. Sisodia added: ''When I read the paper, I was overwhelmed.  The set of experiments in this paper was a tour de force.'' His enthusiasm was shared by other scientists, also not connected with the study. ''We now have a target, an identified target for drug development,''  said Dr. Rudolph Tanzi, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. The hope, Dr. Citron said, is that such a drug might stop the progress of Alzheimer's disease in a person who has it, or even prevent it in those likely to develop it. Still, Dr. Citron and other scientists emphasized that the development of a drug was still years away and that its success could not be predicted.
Scientists in Oregon report today that they have installed jellyfish genes in monkey embryos, using a technique that might eventually be used to create monkeys with added human genes. Such a technique would allow those genes to be studied for the development of treatments for human diseases. But the scientists say they are acutely aware that their research raises a host of troubling questions about reproductive technology. If scientists can add genes to monkey embryos, it should be possible to add genes to human embryos, raising the emotionally fraught issue of human genetic engineering. ''These are matters that need to be discussed,'' said Dr. Barry Zirkin, who leads the division of reproductive biology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health in Baltimore, who was not connected with the Oregon research. What stands out, some experts said, is how simple the method is. If it is refined to be highly effective in monkeys, it could be just a short step to using it to add genes to human embryos. Some genes might correct diseases or prevent them -- like an AIDS resistance gene, or one that might make a person less susceptible to Alzheimer's disease. Adding such genes might be akin to vaccinating a child. The addition of other genes might be more problematic.  Dr. Inder Verma, a molecular biologist at the Salk Institute in San Diego who also was not connected with the work, gave the example of a gene like one for the glutamate receptor protein in the brain, which may improve memory.
Unlike angiograms, scans can show dangerous areas of fatty deposits in arteries that are not blocking blood vessels but that could rupture and cause a heart attack, said Dr. William O'Neill, the corporate director of cardiology at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oaks, Mich. That could let doctors scan smokers and middle-aged and elderly people, find those at risk of a heart attack, and treat them with drugs, potentially saving lives. The scans have some limitations. They cannot penetrate extensive areas of old, calcified plaque, they do not work well when patients are obese or have abnormal heart rhythms, and they use high doses of radiation, similar to the doses used in angiography. Heart disease researchers say that now is the time, while medical centers evaluate the scanners, to make sure they are used only when they will be truly beneficial. But that may not be so easy. ''It's very, very, very hard to control a technology,'' said Dr. Mark Hlatky, a professor of health research and policy and of medicine at Stanford University.
Dr. Golub said he expected that new drugs would strike the Achilles' heels of particular cancers. The treatment will not depend on where the cancer started -- breast, colon, lung -- but rather which pathway is deranged. ''It's starting to come into focus how one might target the problem,'' Dr. Golub said. ''Individual cancers are going to fall one by one by targeting the molecular abnormalities that underlie them.'' And some cancer therapies may have to be taken for a lifetime, turning cancer into a chronic disease. ''Seeing cancer become more like what has happened with AIDS would not be shocking,'' Dr. Golub said. ''Does that mean cure? Not necessarily. We may see patients treated until they die of something else.'' That is what Mr. Weinstein hopes will happen with him. The cancer is still there: new, exquisitely sensitive tests still find a few cells lurking in his bone marrow. And Gleevec has caused side effects. Mr. Weinstein says his fingers and toes sometimes freeze for a few seconds, and sometimes he gets diarrhea.
The Department of Veterans Affairs has issued an advisory to its doctors recommending that they not perform a common knee operation until it is reviewed by a panel of experts. The operation, arthroscopic surgery to relieve pain of osteoarthritis, is done on more than 225,000 middle-age and older Americans each year, at a cost of more than $1 billion to Medicare, the V.A. and private insurers. But a study by V.A. researchers recently concluded that it was no more effective than placebo arthroscopy. Dr. Jonathan B. Perlin, acting deputy under secretary for health at the Veterans Affairs Department, signed the advisory on Aug. 14, and the agency sent it to the nation's V.A. hospitals. The advisory said the operation ''is not indicated'' solely for the relief of pain -- that is, ''absent clear clinical evidence of significant derangement or symptoms due to anatomic and mechanical abnormalities.'' ''It is quite a strong recommendation,'' Dr. Perlin said in a subsequent interview, adding that the V.A. had never before issued a medical advisory, as far as he knew, but that the circumstances surrounding the procedure had been all but unprecedented.
He sees the questions as ''an end-means thing.'' Proponents of the research are holding up lofty goals and dismissing the means to achieve them. Dr. Kilner says there are many who share his ethical qualms. ''We're talking about federal support here,'' he said. ''It is inappropriate to require the entire populace to support something that a significant proportion considers to be such an ethical violation.'' Dr. Zon disagrees. ''As long as the issues are openly discussed and peoples' ethics are examined, why shouldn't we pursue this avenue of research?'' he said. He joins the scientists who are grateful to Ron Reagan. ''What's good about what Ron did is that he opened this debate up to the American public. He showed them what might be the future and asked them to think about it.'' THE DEMOCRATS
Mark B. McClellan, the new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, knows he has critics lying in wait. He also has special interest groups, from corporations to consumer advocates, ready to plead. His decisions, as he is well aware, can save lives or ruin them, and can make or break a company's fortunes. But he focuses, he says, on what is the right thing to do in handling an agency with a budget of $1.6 billion, whose responsibilities reach over 20 percent of the consumer economy. And he is moving forward rapidly. Drugs too expensive? He has a plan. Quality control problems in manufacturing? Another plan. Concerns about dietary supplements, ephedra in particular? He has taken action, with more to come. Errors in dispensing prescribed drugs? He has an initiative. Worries about the risks of hormone therapy for menopause? He has ordered a black box warning on all estrogen-containing products. Not enough vaccines and drugs to protect in case of a terrorist attack? He's taking action. Complaints about what health information can appear on foods? He's changing the rules.
In the mid-1980's, they began showing up at gyms with heavily gay clienteles: men with gaunt cheeks and sunken eyes, but large pectoral muscles and a network of bulging veins. ''I'm a poz hunk,'' Steve Bolerjack wrote in Poz, a magazine for people who are H.I.V. positive, describing his regimen of weight lifting and steroids to counter the skeletal look that can come from H.I.V. He said he initially obtained a prescription for steroids because he was concerned about his low energy, but found that the steroids gave him a look that drew a lot of compliments. But the look -- a sculptured body, zero fat, shaved chest -- has also drawn some derision. People with a body that looks chemically enhanced are often disparagingly called Chelsea Boys, a reference to the Manhattan neighborhood with a large gay population. ''We struggle with it all the time,'' said Dr. Steve Becker, a San Francisco doctor who primarily treats H.I.V.-positive patients. ''It's common to prescribe steroids as a way to counteract wasting. But I draw the line at giving them for purely cosmetic reasons.''
The dilemma is not just medical sophistry. Instead, it touches on a fundamental debate among doctors and researchers. What should be the bottom line? Is it enough to show that you can reduce the likelihood that a person will die of a particular disease? Or must you insist that the overall mortality rate is reduced? The prostate cancer study reveals splits among medical experts. Some, like Dr. Patrick Walsh, a urologic surgeon at Johns Hopkins Hospital, say it is enough to prevent deaths from that disease. ''Have you ever seen anyone die from prostate cancer?'' he asks. ''It's a terrible death.'' The cancer, he said, moves into the bones. ''Bones break and disintegrate. You linger for a year of a painful death. I have three uncles who died of it. One was a favorite uncle, and I was a child watching him die. It was a horrible thing.'' Dr. Albert Mulley, a specialist in internal medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital, has a different perspective. ''I see people who die of esophageal cancer or liver cancer or lung cancer,'' he said. ''There is nothing uniquely terrible about prostate cancer.''
The other line of research, with stem cells from embryos, has a different obstacle. Although, in theory, the cells could be coaxed into developing into any of the body's specialized cells, so far scientists are still working on ways to direct their growth in the laboratory and they have not yet effectively cured diseases, even in animals. The most progress with embryonic stem cells is in mice, where one group of researchers directed the cells to grow into a variety of blood cells, but not yet the ones they want. Another group directed mouse stem cells to grow into nerve cells and tried to use them to treat Parkinson's disease in mice. The nerve cells produced the missing chemical, dopamine, but not enough to cure the disease. As the two lines of research proceed along parallel paths, researchers say it is far too soon to bet on which, if either, will yield cures first. ''It's not either-or,'' said Dr. Diana Bianchi, chief of the division of medical genetics at Tufts New England Medical Center in Boston.
People can keep their weight at the lower end of their genetically determined range, often by watching what they eat and exercising. Or they can allow their weight to soar to the top of their range. But there is little anyone can do to change their range itself, these researchers say. ''There is very strong biological evidence that the brain receives signals from the body and the brain talks back,'' Dr. Leibel said. And this, not conscious decisions about how many calories to take in over days or weeks, is what regulates body weight to keep it in a narrow range, he added. While acknowledging that this notion of weight ranges runs counter to beliefs about willpower and even free will, Dr. Leibel and others said it does not surprise them because the brain signals other sorts of behavior, like drinking and excreting the right amounts of water to maintain a precise balance in the body, and even making sure that people eat to maintain their blood sugar, when necessary.
Patients with diabetes might have no obvious symptoms at all other than sudden, extreme fatigue. It's not clear why diabetics often have these so-called silent heart attacks -- one hypothesis attributes it to damage diabetes can cause to nerves that carry pain signals. ''I say to patients, 'Be alert to the possibility that you may be short of breath,' '' Dr. Antman said. ''Every day you walk down your driveway to go to your mailbox. If you discover one day that you can only walk halfway there, you are so fatigued that you can't walk another foot, I want to hear about that. You might be having a heart attack.'' Other times, said Dr. George Sopko, a cardiologist at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, symptoms like pressure in the chest come and go. That is because a blood clot blocking an artery is breaking up a bit, reforming, breaking and reforming. It was what happened to Mr. Orr when he was at the gym and meeting his friend afterward.
Dr. Daniel Rader, a heart researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, also does not order CRP tests for most patients. ''The question the doctor always has to ask himself is, 'What am I going to do about the result when I get it back?''' Dr. Rader said. ''That's my biggest issue.'' Dr. Rader receives research support and honorariums from a variety of companies making drugs for heart disease. Neither Dr. Grundy nor Dr. Rader has had a CRP test himself. Other doctors order the test for all their patients, and have even tested themselves and their families. Dr. Cannon, for example, tested himself and his wife. His CRP was below 1, he said, and his wife had a level so low it was undetectable. If he had learned that his CRP was elevated, Dr. Cannon said, he would have dieted and gotten more exercise. Dr. Cannon also got a call from a friend's wife. She told him her husband had just had a CRP test and had gotten bad news: his level was 14. Dr. Cannon suggested working on diet and exercise. The husband, he said, ''is overweight, he doesn't exercise enough, they eat terribly.'' Now, Dr. Cannon said, the man and his wife want to change their ways.
Dr. Harmon Eyre, the chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, said that his organization strongly advocated evaluating screening tests. The lung cancer test, spiral CT scanning, Dr. Eyre said, ''should be tested in a randomized clinical trial, yet it is being promoted by hospitals and health care clinics around the country in settings where it has not been evaluated.'' The prostate cancer test, he said, came into widespread use without scientific evidence that it reduced the death rate, so the cancer society urges men to discuss it with their doctors before agreeing to have it. Neuroblastoma, Dr. Harris said, ''is the easy case, where we don't find any benefits.'' But what will happen, he asked, in murkier situations, if studies now under way find, for example, that there is a small decrease in the prostate cancer death rate with screening but a large number of men who end up with unnecessary treatments for tumors that are not dangerous?
An independent panel of experts said today that there was insufficient evidence to show that mammograms prevented breast cancer deaths. The group, which meets regularly to assess evidence on cancer and provide that information to doctors and to the public, said that while it was possible that mammograms were beneficial, it was also possible that they were not. The group, called the P.D.Q. screening and prevention editorial board, agreed here today that seven large studies of mammography had serious flaws, weakening or casting doubt on the studies' validity. The group, which writes information for the National Cancer Institute's online database, said that it would rewrite previous statements to reflect its new view. Previously, the group, which does not make specific recommendations for medical practices, had said that the evidence showed that mammograms prevented breast cancer deaths starting at age 40. The decision by this group clouds a continuing debate over whether women should have regular mammograms. Since 1997, the National Cancer Institute has also recommended that women have regular mammograms, starting in their 40's.
Craig Keller hopes it is true. He looks back at the hard life of his ancestors, even those of his great-grandfather and his grandfather, working as painters, exposed to fumes. And, of course, there was poor Valentin Keller, his Civil War ancestor, his health ruined by the time he was 30. Today, Mr. Keller says, he is big and healthy, almost despite himself. He would like to think it is because he tries to live well, but he is not so sure, especially when he hears about what Dr. Barker and Dr. Fogel and the others have found. Maybe it was his good fortune to have been born to a healthy mother and to be well fed and vaccinated. ''I don't know if we have as much control as we think we do,'' he said. The New Age This is the first article in a series looking at the science of aging. Other articles will explore the genetics of aging, body image and frailty, and who ages well and why.
That, Dr. Taubenberger says, ''has been recognized for 150 years.'' In the 1920's, scientists even isolated viruses from what they used to call fowl plague and what is now known to be bird flu. They were not the same viruses that infected humans. The problem is in deciding what all this means. The history of the 1918 flu can take scientists only so far, Dr. Taubenberger said. ''We don't know how the 1918 pandemic evolved and how the virus emerged into a form that was the finished product,'' he said. ''What we sequenced was a virus that was ready for prime time, not its precursor.'' ''Ultimately,'' Dr. Taubenberger said, ''the answer to the big question is, We don't know. There is no historical precedent for what is going on today.'' AVIAN FLU | LESSONS FROM A PAST PANDEMIC
That, some geneticists say, is what the Human Genome Project has promised, an ability to scan a person's genes and find those that can cause disease. Critics say such projects are just what worry them about the genome project. People will receive a flood of genetic information that may be difficult to understand and interpret about diseases, unlike Tay-Sachs, that can have courses that are impossible to predict. Some see the project as a test case. ''It is a model for delivering these genetic services,'' said Dr. Michael M. Kaback, a geneticist at the University of California at San Diego. ''That is why it is important.'' Dr. Kaback, an architect of the Tay-Sachs screening, emphasized that worldwide screening for 10 diseases would be difficult, requiring careful attention to detail and to assessing the project as it starts. But, he said, ''It could work.'' The project ethicist, Nancy Neveloff Dubler, who directs the bioethics program at Montefiore, said the effort could show the positive side of screening. ''These are largely diseases that take a terrible toll early in life,'' Ms. Dubler said. ''We could save families from sorrow and children from suffering. That's a tremendously important goal.''
A small, privately financed biotechnology company said yesterday that it had created the first human embryos ever produced by cloning. But the embryos died before they  had even eight cells, and most died long before that. Cloning experts outside the company said the experiment was a failure. But by pursuing the research and publicizing it, scientists at the company, Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Mass., have stepped into an ethical controversy. Federal money cannot be used for cloning research involving human embryos, and so the experiments are restricted to the private sector. Advanced Cell Technology was not trying to clone a human being. Rather, it wanted to offer a method that would involve combining human eggs and a person's own cells to create embryos that would provide stem cells. Theoretically, the stem cells could in turn grow into virtually any cell type and serve as replacement tissue in diseases like diabetes.
The investigation of the terrorist attacks on the United States is drawing new attention to a stealthy method of sending messages through the Internet. The method, called steganography, can hide messages in digital photographs or in music files but leave no outward trace that the files were altered. Intelligence officials have not revealed many details about whether, or how often, terrorists are using steganography. But a former French defense ministry official said that it was used by recently apprehended terrorists who were planning to blow up the United States embassy in Paris. The terrorists were instructed that all their communications were to be made through pictures posted on the Internet, the defense official said. The leader of that terrorist plot, Jamal Beghal, told French intelligence officals that he trained in Afganistan and that before leaving that country for France, he met with an associate of Osama bin Laden. The plan was for a suicide bomber to drive a minivan full of explosives through the embassy gates.
Dr. Roses differs. ''In fact, we're not moving fast enough because we don't have the kinds of treatments we need,'' he said. Take his own genetic curse, the heart attack at a young age. ''Half of the people who have these early heart attacks die,'' Dr. Roses said. ''There are a lot of people dying because we aren't moving fast enough.'' IDENTITY
Some orthopedists interviewed about the study said they had wondered for some time about the operation's effectiveness. Dr. Kenneth Fine, an orthopedic surgeon at the George Washington University School of Medicine, said the procedure had long seemed to do nothing for patients' underlying arthritis. ''There are pretty good success rates in terms of patient satisfaction,'' Dr. Fine said, ''but I have always been skeptical.'' Dr. William J. Tipton Jr., executive vice president and chief executive of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, also said he had questioned the operation. ''I'm both a patient and a physician,'' Dr. Tipton said, explaining that he has osteoarthritis. ''My knee is buckling now, but I'm not going to have arthroscopy done. I recognize that it's not going to help.'' Still, he said he would like to see the study repeated before doctors decided whether to do the operation. ''Gradually,'' Dr. Tipton speculated, ''physicians would say to their patients: 'I know you've seen a lot about arthroscopy, but you know what? It doesn't work very well for osteoarthritis of the knee.' ''
Others are trying too. In England, the International Center for Life, in Newcastle upon Tyne, announced it had produced a human embryo by cloning, although it did not say it had extracted stem cells or gone through the many detailed steps to prove that they were stem cells and that they were from a clone, as the South Koreans had done. Until now, scientists had been studying human embryonic stem cells extracted from embryos created for that purpose and did not involve cloning cells from specific patients. They had also obtained stem cells from embryos created at fertility clinics and donated by couples who no longer needed them. In addition, scientists are studying mouse stem cells, working on the difficult task of directing the cells to develop into specific tissue types. But researchers wanted embryos that were genetic matches of patients. The only way to do that was to use embryos that were clones of patients, and human cloning had seemed all but impossible.
It can sound paradoxical. Here are unusual numbers of people with a disease. Toxic chemicals are everywhere, and many of them cause cancers and other diseases in laboratory animals. Why should it be so hard to find a cause? Some disease clusters have been successfully linked to toxins: Coal miners got black lung disease; asbestos workers got mesothelioma. Workers cleaning containers where polyvinyl chloride was synthesized, breathing in fumes, got cancer of the blood vessels of the liver until machines replaced them. But these examples of proven cause and effect are the rare exceptions, statisticians say. And they have two things in common: The chemical exposure was enormous, and the disease was extraordinarily rare. Most disease clusters are very different. Autism, breast cancer and leukemia are fairly common. And even when there does seem to be an unusually high incidence of a disease, the search for a chemical basis usually turns up minute amounts of toxic substances that also are found in other places where there are no clusters. In other words, linking the suspect chemicals to the disease can be very hard. It can also be difficult to know if a cluster is anything more than a chance occurrence. And chance is hard to ignore.
Doctors say they are chagrined when they hear such stories. But, they say, it can be hard for them to know how a doctor treats a typical patient when they themselves often are treated with kid gloves. ''You'll occasionally get a patient who comes from another physician and says something bad about that doctor, but it's hard to know whether they're a complaining patient or the doctor is really bad,'' said Dr. Robert Swerlick, a dermatologist at Emory University. Some patients say they have to rely on each other's experience to know which doctors to seek out and which to avoid. The Council on Size and Weight Discrimination, a nonprofit organization, publishes lists of fat-friendly doctors on its Web site. And after her experience with the doctor who would not tell her her diagnosis, Joanne Wong helped found a Web site, RateMDs.com, where patients can rate doctors. But, said Dr. Swerlick, such ratings are not exactly representative samplings.
Now scientists are asking if the SARS virus has an animal host. Coronaviruses are extremely common: two different coronaviruses cause 15 to 30 percent of the colds in people and other coronaviruses cause serious problems for farmers when they infect pigs, chickens and cows, and can drive scientists to distraction by causing epidemics in laboratory mice. BUT the SARS virus was a surprise, Dr. Holmes said. Not only was its genetic sequence very unlike that of any other coronaviruses, but it had so many minute differences from known viruses that it seemed to have split off long ago, quietly evolving in some as yet unknown animal species. It does not appear to have previously infected humans, she said. When, in preliminary studies, investigators tested blood from blood banks they saw no evidence that people had antibodies to the virus. That would have been a sign of previous infections. Dr. Holmes said that the SARS virus's genetic sequence does not allow her even to guess about what animal it came from. But, she predicted, that mystery will be solved.
When it seemed that the South Koreans had taken a giant leap forward in stem cell research, he noted, ''we panicked into thinking that we have to join in.'' Politicians and patient groups argued that cures were around the corner if scientists could get the needed support. States poured money into stem cell programs. The collapsing South Korean claims, Dr. Cameron added, made him ask: ''Where's the beef? Where are those cures? Why is it that there is no private money going into this research? The business community values it at zero.'' Richard Doerflinger, deputy director of anti-abortion activities at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, said that he has argued for some time that the stem cell proponents were exaggerating the state of the science and misleading the public about scientific accomplishments. They promised cures that, if they ever came, would not come any time soon. But Mr. Doerflinger said that when he tried to point out what he saw as misleading claims, '' no one would listen.''
''They never got out of their 50's and 60's,'' Mr. Keller said. ''So that's kind of in the back of your mind.'' He worries about his lungs, given his family history. He had pneumonia once and has had bronchitis. But, Mr. Keller reasons, he is so physically different from his ancestors -- he has never smoked and is so much healthier, so much better fed -- that he really thinks he will break the spell. And if exercise is good for health, the Kellers certainly have exercised. Mr. Keller displays a bookcase in their basement, crammed with athletic trophies. Mrs. Keller's are from baton twirling, Mr. Keller's are from baseball, basketball, softball and soccer. Their daughters, 19-year-old Rachel and 22-year-old Kristy, got theirs cheerleading. Mrs. Keller said that when she was her daughters' age, ''I didn't think about my health very much.'' ''But later in my 30's and toward my 40's,'' she said, ''I started to think about it. You try to eat right, you try to exercise. And you do see your parents with illnesses. And you wonder about yourself. My mom had a quadruple bypass when she was 75, and she had to have a pacemaker after that. She's now in her 80's, but you do wonder.''
Some participants took anti-inflammatories and some did not, by their own choice and not the researchers' design. Most who took the drugs used them for arthritis. In the group that took no anti-inflammatory drugs, 210 out of 2,553 developed dementia. But 3 out of 233 who had taken the drugs for at least two years developed it. The dose did not appear to be important, the researchers found. The effect was specific for Alzheimer's. The drugs did not help other diseases like ministrokes, which can cause memory loss and confusion. The sole drugs that seemed to affect the risk of Alzheimer's were anti-inflammatories. Aspirin, unlike other anti-inflammatory drugs, did not appear to have a protective effect, possibly, the researchers said, because participants were taking very low doses. Dr. John Breitner, an Alzheimer's disease researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the new study was impressive. Unlike many others, it followed healthy people for a long time, an average of 6.8 years, to see who came down with Alzheimer's disease. The investigators also had impeccable records of the patients' use of medicines.
Two years after the abortion pill was introduced in the United States, abortion providers say that only a small percentage of women seeking abortions are using it and few doctors outside of abortion clinics are offering it. The distributor for Mifeprex, the abortion-inducing pill once known as RU-486, said yesterday that more than 100,000 women in America had used the drug since it went on sale in November 2000. In that time, however, about 2.6 million women in America had abortions, and about half of them had abortions within seven weeks of pregnancy, the time when Mifeprex could be used. Advocates for abortion rights, who had fought for years for the drug's introduction, had predicted that Mifeprex would change the politics and the practice of abortion in this country. But medical abortions, with pills, are more time-consuming and expensive than surgical abortions, doctors say, and women often say they are not interested when they hear what is involved -- three office visits over two weeks, two separate drugs, sometimes long-lasting bleeding and cramping, compared with a surgical procedure that is over quickly.
Some scientists who had reviewed the E.P.A.'s previous dioxin report were skeptical of the new analysis. Dr. Morton Lippmann, a professor of environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, was head of the agency's advisory board in 1994 and has agreed to head the board being put together now. Dr. Lippmann said that while he had not seen the new draft report, scientific research on dioxin since 1994 ''has been less than definitive.'' Dr. Michael Gough, a retired biologist who was on the agency's advisory board in 1994 and headed a panel that evaluated the Ranch Hands data for the Department of Health and Human Services, said there was no reason to believe that the risk of getting cancer from dioxin was higher than had been thought. ''There has been no epidemiological study in the last five years -- since their last assessment -- that makes that claim any more credible,'' Dr. Gough said.
When Reproductive Medicine Associates, or RMA, decided to open a fertility clinic in Morristown, N.J., the founding doctors left nothing to chance. The market was already saturated, and the doctors realized that even though they were experts in infertility and had recruited a leading embryologist to work her magic with sperm and eggs, they could not just sit back and wait for patients to appear. They needed to do some aggressive marketing. That meant courting potential patients and wooing local doctors -- gynecologists, urologists and internists -- who could refer patients. They hired a marketing consultant, started weekly support group meetings for infertile couples and invited doctors to dinners, including a wine-tasting dinner last year with a sommelier flown in from France. They had little choice but to invest heavily in marketing, fertility experts agree. Infertility has become a big, fiercely competitive business, with a billion dollars in revenues and with more and more doctors fighting for a limited number of patients. The growth of the field has been fueled by rising success rates and increased demand from patients, many of whom pay tens of thousands of dollars out of their own pockets in hopes of having a child.
It is not just orthopedists who often miss opportunities. In a paper published last year in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology &amp; Metabolism, Dr. Ethel Siris, director of the Toni Stabile Osteoporosis Center at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center in New York, and her colleagues reviewed the data and found it depressing. ''In virtually all the reports that have been published in the past few years, physicians who deal directly with the fracture event rarely take appropriate action,'' they wrote. ''This includes radiologists who review X-rays that include the spine, orthopedic surgeons who treat acute fractures, physiatrists who oversee rehabilitation after the fracture, and primary care physicians to whom the patients return for overall care once the fracture has healed.'' For example, in one study reviewed in the paper, of 934 women over age 60 who had routine chest X-rays, 132 had visible moderate to severe vertebral fractures. But only 17 of them had these fractures noted on their discharge statements.
If the eavesdropper, for example, had a secret way to decode the message saying ''start'' and it took a minute to do the calculation needed to decode it, it would be too late by the time the eavesdropper got going. The sender and recipient would already have their string of numbers and that string of numbers, once broadcast, could never be retrieved. It would be infeasible to store the endless string of numbers in any computer and so they are essentially gone forever. Often, Dr. Rabin said, eavesdroppers will capture and store encoded messages hoping to decode them at later, either when computers have improved -- making it easier to do the calculations to break a code -- or when the method for encoding and decoding is known, perhaps because it has been stolen. But, he said, messages encoded with his system can never be broken by these means because the random numbers used in encoding and decoding are used once and are never stored.
''Things change very quickly,'' Dr. Wang said. ''Dependence of a specialty on a single procedure is always a concern.'' His committee suggested that gastroenterologists think about what else they might do. Maybe obesity treatment, the group said, or perhaps more of a focus on liver disease or actually treating colon cancer instead of just finding it. Or maybe gastroenterologists will not have to cede CT screening to radiologists after all. Why couldn't a gastroenterologist read a CT scan of the colon? If that is the direction they want to go, gastroenterologists can look to cardiologists for inspiration, Dr. Wang added. In cardiology, when angiograms were developed to look at the heart, cardiologists invented a new subspecialty to do those tests themselves. They could have let radiologists take over angiography, but they didn't. Now these interventional cardiologists are expanding, going beyond the heart to blood vessels all over the body, putting stents into carotid arteries that feed the brain and into blocked blood vessels in the legs.
In a paper published Oct. 10 in Obesity, Dr. Brownell and his colleagues studied more than 3,000 fat people, asking them about their experiences of stigmatization and discrimination and how they responded. Almost everyone said they ate more. IDEAS &amp; TRENDS Correction:  November 5, 2006, Sunday  An article last Sunday about a tendency to blame obesity for a range of problems misattributed the journal that published a letter about how much extra fuel airlines use carrying fatter Americans. It was the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, not The American Journal of Public Health. The article also misspelled the name of a Brown University political science professor who commented that the intent of such studies is to persuade the obese to lose weight. He is James Morone, not Marone.
Elsewhere, many doctors are refusing to see Medicare patients. ''Some counties in Washington have no doctors who take new Medicare patients,'' Dr. Douglas Paauw, a professor of medicine at the University of Washington, said. Doctors in South Florida do not have a choice. Private insurers there pay the same as Medicare or less, and so many old people live in the area that if doctors want to practice, they must accept them. But how to make a living? One way, Dr. Robert Colton, an internist in Boca Raton, said, is to see lots of patients, spending just a few minutes with each and referring complicated problems to specialists. Dr. Colton did that for a while, seeing as many as 35 patients a day. A typical busy internist, he said, would see 20 patients a day. ''I felt like a glorified triage nurse,'' he said. ''If you try to handle a complex problem, it slows you down,'' Dr. Colton said. ''You have to sit down with the family, meet with the patients, talk to them. If you say you have coughing and you are short of breath and your knee hurts, I might have sent you to two different specialists.''
Mr. Orr anticipated a pleasant day on Feb. 6, starting with a workout at his gym, then lunch with a friend before he went to work at Smith &amp; Wollensky, a steakhouse where he is a manager. He arrived at the gym around noon and lifted weights, concentrating on the pectoral muscles of his chest. Then he moved on to an elliptical cross-trainer for cardiovascular exercise. After half an hour on the elliptical, Mr. Orr felt a tightness in his chest. ''I attributed it to the weight training,'' he said, but stopped exercising, showered, dressed and walked to his car. ''I felt really bad, out of sorts,'' he said. The pressure in his chest would ease off and then intensify, and now he was sweating profusely and was nauseated. When he arrived at the restaurant, he told his friend Darrin Friedman that he would have to beg off from lunch. ''I feel like hell,'' he told Mr. Friedman.
Dr. Zuckerman said she still has questions about the safety of implants, but would support their sale if those questions were answered. Nonetheless, she said, ''I think that Joe Kelly's comments touched a chord for a lot of people.'' Other forms of cosmetic surgery do not seem to elicit the same emotional reaction, said Dr. Mary H. McGrath, a panel member who is a professor of plastic surgery at the University of California in San Francisco. ''In our society, orthodontia is really a surgical enhancement,'' she said. ''It is not without risk, but it is commonplace and widely accepted.'' So, too, she said, is surgery to repair children's protruding ears and breast reduction surgery for boys with gynecomastia, or abnormally large breasts. The condition is not uncommon among adolescent boys and eventually disappears in most cases. ''I never heard any comment that this is an inappropriate cosmetic enhancement,'' Dr. McGrath said, referring to the breast reduction surgery, although it does carry risks of anesthesia, bleeding, infection or nipple numbness. ''Nor have I heard anyone say a physician is doing this out of self-interest. But those same two issues come up with young women who are trying to make their breasts larger.''
It is becoming increasingly clear, Dr. Welch said, that the more pathologists look for cancer, the more they find it, but that this does not mean the cancer is worth finding. ''At some point this has got to be crazy,'' he said. ''Everyone can't have prostate cancer.''
''We now are seeing really phenomenal results in experienced hands,'' Dr. Ornato said. ''We can open 95 to 96 percent of arteries, and bleeding in the brain is virtually unheard of. It's a safer route if it is done by very experienced people and if it is done promptly. Those are big ifs.'' The ifs were not a problem for Mr. Orr. His decision to go to Brigham and Women's Hospital proved exactly right. But he did not know that when he chose the hospital -- he chose it because his doctor was affiliated with Brigham. A Need for More Angioplasty Currently, 30 percent of patients who are candidates for reperfusion do not receive it, and of those who do, only 18 percent are treated with angioplasty, said Dr. Alice Jacobs, director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Boston University School of Medicine and a past president of the American Heart Association. Of the nation's 5,000 acute care hospitals, Dr. Jacobs said, only 1,200 provide angioplasty.
''Our whole gestalt is that there are only 30,000 genes, and when we work out this network, we are going to understand cells,'' said Dr. Leland H. Hartwell, president and director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2001. But, Dr. Hartwell said, no cell ever grows from scratch from DNA in a test tube. Every cell that has ever existed arose from a cell that preceded it. Every cell on earth is part of a line of ancestry that traces from the very first primordial cell. ''People like to look at DNA content as bytes of information,'' he said. ''What they are neglecting is the pre-existing structure. If you think about how much information it would take to make the pre-existing structure, it's astronomical. You can't make it unless you've got it.'' Another mystery is genetic variation. ''We need to realize that all of our biology, all of our understanding, comes from studying inbred populations'' like mice that are bred to be genetically identical, Dr. Hartwell said. But, he added, ''We know we are missing a good part of what is going on.''
As for the $50,000 payment to the egg donor, why not? ''It's like offering someone a million dollars to play professional football,''Dr. Fost said.  ''You are perfectly free to walk away from it. People make these choices all their lives.'' In the end, he said, ''whether children are valued and how they are treated has very little to do with how they are conceived.''
''This is the big issue in epidemiology,'' Dr. James Robins, an epidemiologist and a statistician at the Harvard School of Public Health said. ''The question is what effects can we reliably detect?'' Though they are not the first randomized studies to contradict findings in observational studies, the estrogen studies are leading to a problem. Some would call the disparity a crisis. The conclusions that hormonal therapy may have important benefits arose from observational studies that were models in medicine. If those studies were wrong, then why? How many other widely held beliefs that emerged from the same studies or ones like them have to be held up to question? It is, Dr. Robins said, ''a research question,'' one whose outcome affects almost everything that is known about public health and preventive medicine. The most recent turn in the estrogen debate occurred when a prestigious group of 28 scientists and doctors, authors of the International Position Paper on Women's Health and Menopause, said hormone replacement therapy's established benefits were much more limited than many doctors and women had believed.
''When you have a lot of doctors fighting for the dollar, there's a lot of competition,'' said Dr. Mark V. Sauer, a highly regarded fertility expert, who directs Columbia University's fertility center. Dr. Sauer said he found a market niche -- the patients that other centers turn down. They include older patients whose chances of success are very low, lesbian couples and couples in which the man is infected with H.I.V. And he has competitive prices. ''Right now, we have a brand-new site and we want to get some attention,'' Dr. Sauer said. ''The first cycle is discounted so that instead of costing the normal $7,000 they can get it for just under $6,000. It's not meant to undercut other programs, but let's face it, this is a competitive marketing plan.'' For RMA, breaking into the New York and New Jersey market meant advertising that its success rates were not just high but believable -- verified by an independent auditing firm. It meant putting staff doctors and the embryology director, Kathy Miller, on speakers' boards for companies that make fertility drugs.
Mr. Greenberg shares her sentiments. ''I am disappointed and disheartened and disgusted,'' he said. The Families II  Aiding Research, With a Wider View Like Daniel Greenberg, Sharon Terry of Sharon, Mass., found herself with two children with a rare genetic disease that she had never known existed. And like Mr. Greenberg, Ms. Terry realized that the only way anyone would look for the gene that made her two children ill would be if she provided money, body tissue and medical histories from families whose members harbored the gene.  But Ms. Terry did one thing that had never occurred to Mr. Greenberg. She and her husband, Patrick, had researchers sign a contract giving the families rights to share in the profits from any gene patent that might arise. Ms. Terry's son and daughter have pseudoxanthoma elasticum, which causes mineralization of elastic tissue. The most serious consequence is blindness, which occurs when the membrane behind the retina calcifies and develops cracks. Blood vessels leak through the cracks, destroying vision.
The Walking Test Eleanor Simonsick's initiation into the unrecognized debilitations of aging came with a research study she helped set up. The question was whether older people who are relatively vigorous are also longer-lived. As an epidemiologist at the National Institute on Aging, she thought it was time to ask that in a rigorous way. So she and her colleagues recruited 3,075 apparently healthy people in their 70's who said they could walk a quarter of a mile with no trouble and climb a flight of stairs. Each was asked to walk up and down a corridor 10 times, for a distance of a quarter mile, maintaining their pace and not stopping to rest. A quarter of them could not do it. And it was not just a matter of age. The average age of those who could do it was 73. So was the average age of those who could not. Dr. Harris explained: ''I believe most people can amble. But we were asking them to walk as quickly as they could without stopping. That's what people couldn't do.''
It was chance that led Dr. Netz to his first insight into the nature of the Stomachion. Last August, he says, just as he was about to start transcribing one of the manuscript pages, he got a gift in the mail, a blue cut-glass model of a Stomachion puzzle. It was made by a retired businessman from California who found Dr. Netz on the Internet as a renowned Archimedes scholar. Looking at the model, Dr. Netz realized that a diagram on the page he was transcribing was actually a rearrangement of the pieces of the Stomachion puzzle. Suddenly, he understood what Archimedes was getting at. The diagram involved 14 pieces, and the word ''multitude'' seemed to be associated with it. Mr. Heiberg and those who followed him thought this meant that you could get many figures by rearranging the pieces. ''This is part of the reason people didn't see what it was about,'' Dr. Netz said. But the old interpretation seemed trivial, hardly worth Archimedes' time.
There is no one in medicine who does not consider it both crucial and long overdue to have electronic records in doctor's offices and hospitals. With electronic files, patient records are not stuck on pieces of paper in endless files, but are on a screen at the touch of a key. The computers alert doctors to do medical tests and avert errors by warning when they write a prescription for the wrong drug or the wrong dose. Patients can often see their own files and even make their own appointments, online, from their homes. But most doctors have balked. The systems cost tens of thousands of dollars, and doctors worry that the companies selling them and providing support will go out of business. Many use computers to file health insurance claims, but only 20 percent to 25 percent of the nation's 650,000 licensed doctors outside the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs are using electronic patient records.
''Screening programs bring in patients,'' Dr. Berry said. ''It isn't just the mammography, but it's the biopsies, the surgeries and the like. We know that screening is exquisitely fine at finding cancers. Therefore it brings in patients and they demand treatment.'' The problem, he said, is if the women who have mammograms fare no better, or do even worse because of excessive treatment, than women who are not screened.
Dr. Sodroski described it as ''a great question we're actively looking at it.'' He said more research was needed to find out how TRIM5 worked and whether drugs or gene therapy might increase its levels so that even the less effective human form successfully blocked H.I.V. ''It's a fundamental discovery and I can see a lot of creative ways people might think about using it,'' Dr. Sodroski said. ''We've just scratched the surface.''
For the first time in its history, Medicare has systematically begun to make payments for new and expensive treatments and diagnostic tests conditional on agreement by companies or other groups to pay for studies on whether these new methods actually work on the Medicare patients who get them. The move was decided by the agency's recently appointed director, Dr. Mark McClellan, who said the goal was better and more cost-effective medicine. The new initiatives began this year when Dr. McClellan, who is both an internist and an economist, decided that evaluating treatments for elderly Americans falls under Medicare's purview to pay for whatever is medically necessary. If the treatment does not work, he argues, then it really is not medically necessary, and Medicare should not be paying. Over the past six months, he has been fundamentally transforming Medicare's scope by offering to pay for a number of new and expensive treatments and diagnostic tests -- ranging from $30,000-a-dose cancer drugs to brain scans to diagnose Alzheimer's -- but with a catch. Patients can only have them if they enter into studies that evaluate how well they work. And someone other than Medicare will have to pay for those studies.
Dr. Wadden said that even in that handful of studies, hardly any of them reported data for everyone who enrolled in the weight-loss programs. Most included only people who had completed the programs, making the outcomes ''definitely best-case scenarios,'' he said. The costs of commercial weight-loss programs can vary from $65 for three months on eDiets to $167 for the same time in Weight Watchers to more than $2,000 for a medically supervised very low-calorie diet. ''Given the lack of good comparative data, it may make sense to try the cheaper alternatives first,'' Mr. Cleland said. Other experts said that patients might want to forgo the programs altogether. ''Doctors could do as well as these programs'' in helping people lose weight, said Dr. George Blackburn, an obesity specialist at Harvard Medical School, simply by counseling people to diet and exercise. He added, ''Doctors can, ought to and are qualified to get involved.''
Women's Capital Corporation, which distributes the drug, originally asked that Plan B be sold by prescription only. Now the company wants its status changed. ''When the product was first introduced, it was such a radical concept for many that we felt we needed to soften the ground politically and professionally,'' said Kirsten Moore, president of Reproductive Health Technologies, an advocacy group that works with Women's Capital. In addition, she said, Women's Capital did not have the resources to market the product as a retail drug. That is one reason the company is selling Plan B to Barr Laboratories, which was willing to take over distribution of the drug, whether over the counter or not. At one time, drug companies decided for themselves whether a drug would be sold by prescription or not. Sometimes the same drug, in the same dosage and for the same indication, was sold both ways. The Durham-Humphrey Act of 1951, one of whose sponsors, Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic Senator from Minnesota, was a former pharmacist, said a drug had to be one or the other, and gave the F.D.A. authority to make that determination.
In 1989, Dr. David Eddy, who is an independent consultant and an adviser to Kaiser Permanente, Southern California, summed up the situation in a paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine. ''It is important to emphasize that these conclusions are not based on a lack of evidence of an effect,'' Dr. Eddy wrote, ''but are based on good evidence that there is no effect.'' For Dr. Kramer, it was a valuable lesson. ''This is the classic case,'' Dr. Kramer said. ''You were picking up cancers that would not have killed the patients, and you were curing people who did not need to be cured. In exchange you were doing a lot more surgery.'' The cancer institute hopes to do a large definitive study involving at least 20,000 people who would be randomly assigned to have a CT scan or, for comparison, to forgo it. Dr. Kramer is optimistic that once the uncertainties of the lung scan are explained, people will volunteer for the study.
Last month, another study showed that a newer diabetes drug, rosiglitazone, might be more effective than either metformin or diet and exercise. Over three years, it reduced the risk of developing diabetes by 60 percent in people with elevated blood sugar levels. Both drugs are relatively safe. Patients may lose about five pounds if they take metformin; other than that its major side effect is gastrointestinal disturbances, like a sense of fullness or soft bowel movements. Patients may gain about five pounds with rosiglitazone, about half of which is from fluid retention. That increases the risk of heart failure in people with heart disease. But with the drugs' effectiveness in preventing diabetes, maybe, some specialists say, doctors will soon view blood sugar as they do blood pressure or cholesterol. As soon as they spot an abnormally high level, they will whip out their prescription pads. Already, health authorities have ventured along that path. International treatment guidelines once said that the first step for patients with full spectrum Type 2 diabetes was to exercise and lose weight. Only after patients had tried that and utterly failed were doctors to prescribe drugs.
One possible explanation, Dr. Williamson said, is that as the number of smokers started to plummet, the demand for calories went up and the food industry began offering and advertising larger portions and more snack foods. ''The food industry in general subconsciously picked up on this and went to town,'' he said. Soon overeating more became the norm, for everyone, even children. Over the same period, said Dr. David Musto, a historian of science at Yale, America's preoccupation with healthy foods -- oat bran, broccoli, fish, etc. -- also resulted in what he called a ''barrage'' of pro-eating commercial messages. In the 1960's, Dr. Musto said, it was socially imperative to smoke. ''A man had to know his brand'' of cigarettes, he said. In much the same way, he said, it became socially imperative to eat the right foods -- those supposed to be good for you. ''The process of becoming obese is greatly facilitated by a search for health and healthy foods,'' Dr. Musto said. ''You've read that something fights Alzheimer's or lowers your blood pressure, so why shouldn't you have a healthy portion?''
This raises the question, Dr. Simmons said, of whether all along people may have been exposed to a slight heart attack risk in order to get relief from the pain of arthritis. ''This may be something that arthritis patients have been facing perhaps for decades and it hasn't been known,'' he said. And it may never be known, Dr. Monica Bertagnolli, a cancer surgeon at Harvard, said. ''No one is going to take some poor arthritis patient and put them on a placebo for three years,'' to compare their heart attack rate to others taking anti-inflammatory drugs. For now, said Dr. Bresalier, science simply does not and can not have all the answers. Every drug has risks and benefits, and often it is impossible to know all of them even after a drug is being sold. But that does not mean that drugs are bad or that federal regulators are lax.
''It was dramatic,'' said the principal investigator, Dr. Stephen R. Bloom, a professor of endocrinology at Hammersmith Hospital at Imperial College School of Medicine in London. ''We haven't had anyone who didn't get a result.'' The obese subjects ate only 1,810 calories for the rest of the day, compared with 2,456 for those given a saltwater injection. The thin subjects ate 1,533 calories after they had the hormone infusion but 2,312 when they had saltwater. Dr. Bloom emphasized that the findings were preliminary. PYY is an experimental substance; no doctor can prescribe it. And the researchers have not yet tried to find out whether people lose weight if they get PYY infusions day after day. But obesity researchers say the work, which began just two years ago, is encouraging. ''It's part of the moving front of research that's adding new and potentially important molecules into the pathways that control body weight,'' said Dr. Jeffrey Flier, an obesity researcher who is chief academic officer at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.
The study began in 1992 to 1993, with a total of 4,500 participants in the two cities, all at least 65 years old and with normal memory and reasoning skills. The investigators examined the participants again in 1994 to 1995 and once more in 1997 to 1998, asking how many had begun to lose their memories and ability to reason in the interim and how many of those had the type of progressive dementia typical of Alzheimer's. By the study's end, the Americans had two to three times more dementia and Alzheimer's disease than the Nigerians, the investigators report. While 1.35 percent of the Nigerians developed dementia in the five years of the study, 3.24 percent of the Indianapolis blacks developed it. And while 1.15 percent of the Nigerians developed Alzheimer's disease, 2.52 percent of the Indianapolis group developed it. Now, Dr. Hendrie and others said, the challenge is to understand why the Americans were so much more likely to get Alzheimer's disease. A key suspect, they said, is vascular disease -- high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, strokes. While blocked blood vessels in the brain can cause memory loss on their own, Dr. Hendrie said there were intriguing hints  that vascular disease could somehow prime the brain to develop the clinical symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. The Nigerians in the study had lower blood pressures and cholesterol levels that were as much as 60 points below those of the Americans.
Bicycling experts wince when they see novices riding on wide padded seats, assuming that a hard narrow one will lead to buttock pain. A wide seat makes the rider rock from side to side, said Rob Vandermark, the president of Seven Cycles of Watertown, Mass, who has made frames for a number of bicycling stars, including Mr. Armstrong. ''The bigger the seat, the more chafing or rubbing,'' he said. Worse, wide seats do not support the pelvis properly, notes Tom Kellogg, a bicycle racer, custom-frame builder, and president of Spectrum Cycles in Breinigsville, Pa. The seat, he said, should support the ischial tuberosities, the two bones at the bottom of the pelvis that bear the rider's weight. ''Cushioning does not help; the shape of the saddle does,'' he said. Dave Levy, a custom builder, former bicycle racer and the owner of Ti Cycles in Seattle, points out that experienced bicyclists support one-third of their weight on their hands, one-third on their feet, and one-third on their buttocks.
''The danger is that it is not the use of hormones that is driving this relationship, but it is being the kind of woman who uses hormone therapy,'' Dr. Breitner said. ''There is no way you can get around that except by doing a randomized controlled trial,'' in which women are randomly assigned to take, or not take, the drugs. Such studies of estrogen and Alzheimer's risk are now under way. In fact, it was observational studies that helped convince medical experts -- incorrectly, as it turned out -- that estrogen protected women from heart attacks and strokes. Such studies can have other drawbacks as well, and some occurred in Dr. Breitner's study. For example, its conclusions were based on just 88 women who developed Alzheimer's in the study period. The researchers subdivided those women into hormone users and nonusers and, among the users, into those taking hormones currently and those who took them previously. They also took into account the duration of the drug therapy. The number of women who fell into any of these groups was small, making the study's conclusions less certain.
There was no policy at the National Institutes of Health prohibiting the study, so Dr. Seeff decided to go ahead with it. The investigators focused on the 8,568 men in the study who had Social Security numbers, allowing federal scientists to trace them. Blood tests showed that 17 men had been infected with the hepatitis C virus when they were at that Air Force base during the Korean War, the same percentage as is found among healthy young military recruits today. Seven of the men had since died, but only one had had chronic liver disease. He had died of liver disease 42 years after his stint at the Air Force base. But what about the others? Two had no known addresses, but eight did. For a year and a half, Dr. Seeff worked on a letter to send these men, consulting with ethicists and other doctors, writing draft after draft. He knew the risks: the men could be repelled by the idea of government scientists tracking them down after all these years, they might simply throw the letter away, they might be terrified by the news that doctors had found a dread virus in their 50-year-old blood.
The study began in 1975, nearly a decade after the fecal test was developed but before anyone knew if it was effective in screening for colon cancer. Their first result was published in 1993, showing that people who had the fecal blood test had a 33 percent reduction in their death rate from colon cancer. Two large European studies subsequently confirmed that result, Dr. Mandel said. At the time, Dr. Mandel said, he predicted the study might eventually show that the test helped to prevent cancer. But it took years of waiting for the prevention result to become apparent in these healthy people. Dr. Mandel said he assumed that individuals offered the test ended up having many more polyps removed than the control group -- that, he said, was the only plausible explanation for the results. Since the control group was basically left alone, he did not know how many polyps were removed from this set of people.
In addition, Dr. Wilmore, the exercise physiologist, said it was clear from the scattered data points that maximum heart rates could vary widely from the formula. ''If it says 150, it could be 180 and it could be 120,'' Dr. Wilmore said. But the formula quickly entered the medical literature. Even though it was almost always presented as an average maximum  rate, the absolute numbers took on an air of received wisdom in part, medical scientists said, because the time was right. Doctors urging heart patients to exercise wanted a way to gauge exercise intensity. At the same time, exercise gurus, promoting aerobic exercise to the public, were asking how hard people should push themselves to improve their cardiovascular fitness. Suddenly, there was a desire for a simple formula to estimate maximum heart rates. ''You tell people to exercise at a moderate intensity,'' Dr. Haskell said. ''Well, what's a moderate intensity?''
John Kovarik got a rude shock one day last year when he went to his pharmacy to fill a prescription: His insurance company refused to pay for it. ''I was flabbergasted,'' said Mr. Kovarik, a lawyer in South Palm Beach, Fla., with a life-threatening genetic disorder known as Wilson's disease. To fight its symptoms, Mr. Kovarik needs an effective treatment to keep copper from accumulating in his body and destroying his vital organs. He had been taking a drug that could have caused irreversible and sometimes lethal side effects. So, Mr. Kovarik said, he negotiated the maze of his health maintenance organization to find a doctor who would prescribe a newer and safer drug, Galzin. But when his insurance company, Humana Inc., refused to pay for Galzin, Mr. Kovarik angrily called the company from the pharmacy counter. ''I was telling them that I have this life-threatening disease,'' Mr. Kovarik said, ''and that this drug is life sustaining. I told them that the drug I was using was having deleterious side effects. I told them that Galzin is F.D.A. approved.'' Later, he wrote letter after letter, to no avail.
Some statisticians and epidemiologists said that the study's methods and data were exemplary and that the authors -- Dr. Williamson and Dr. Katherine M. Flegal of the disease control centers, and Dr. Barry I. Graubard and Dr. Mitchell H. Gail of the cancer institute -- were experienced and highly regarded scientists. ''This is a well-known group, and I thought their analysis and their statistical approaches were very good,'' said Dr. Barbara Hulka, an emerita professor of epidemiology at the University of North Carolina. The study did not explain why overweight appeared best as far as mortality was concerned. But Dr. Williamson said the reason might be that most people die when they are over 70. Having a bit of extra fat in old age appears to be protective, he said, giving rise to more muscle and more bone. ''It's called the obesity paradox,'' Dr. Williamson said. But, he said, while the paradox is real, the reasons are speculative. ''It's raw conjecture,'' he said.
The other organ whose cells now appear to regenerate is the heart. And while some heart disease experts are astonished, the scientist who led the study, Dr. Piero Anversa, a heart researcher at New York Medical College in Valhalla, said he never believed the dogma that the heart did not grow new cells. Last year, his group reported tantalizing evidence that he was right. Scrutinizing the hearts of people who had died shortly after having heart attacks, Dr. Anversa and his colleagues reported that there were dividing cells in the damaged hearts and that those cells were most numerous in the heart tissue that was next to the area killed by the heart attack. Heart disease experts were overwhelmed. ''This is a breakthrough, at least for a new way of thinking about the heart's recuperative power and ways to repair a damaged heart,'' said Dr. Valentin Fuster, a former president of the American Heart Association.
The problem with positing dangers from the phones, scientists say, is that the microwave radiation emitted by them is too weak to break bonds in molecules. It has been hard to figure out how the microwaves would produce damage other than by heating tissue, which does not seem to occur. While microwave ovens can heat tissue, the power from the phones is too low to produce heating. In their new report in Nature, the scientists say that the worms exposed to microwaves produce a type of protein, called heat shock proteins, that they and other species, including humans, make in response to injuries, like heat or certain toxins. But, they say, the microwave radiation did not heat the worms. As evidence that there was no heating, the investigators measured the temperature in the petri dishes where the minuscule worms floated in liquid. Since temperature probes are larger than these worms, it can be hard to know what the actual temperatures of the worms are as they bounce around in the dishes.
Dr. Ackerman even questions whether the ''epidemic'' of melanoma proclaimed by many dermatologists exists. The definition of the cancer, he says, has changed over time, leading doctors to diagnose, remove and cure cancerous growths that once would not have been called melanoma. ''The criteria today, clinically and histopathologically, are diametrically different from those 30 years ago,'' he said. In medical school, he continued, ''we were taught that melanoma is a big, black, fungating tumor that kills. Who would have believed then that you can recognize melanoma for what it is when it is small and flat and the size of the fingernail on your pinky? You would have said they were insane.'' Anyone who argues that sun exposure causes melanoma, Dr. Ackerman says, needs to explain why blacks and Asians get melanoma almost exclusively on skin that is not exposed to sunlight: the palms, soles, nails and mucous membranes. Even in whites, the most common melanoma sites -- the leg in women, the trunk in men -- are hardly the most sun-exposed body parts.
Four years after researchers in Scotland startled the world by announcing that they had cloned a sheep named Dolly, scientists say evidence is mounting that creating healthy animals through cloning is more difficult than they had expected. The clones that have been produced, they say, often have problems severe enough -- developmental delays, heart defects, lung problems and malfunctioning immune systems -- to give pause to anyone thinking of cloning a human being. In one example that seems like science fiction come true, some cloned mice that appeared normal suddenly, as young adults, grew grotesquely fat. It is not that one particular thing goes wrong or one specific aspect of development goes awry, researchers say. Rather, leading cloning experts and developmental biologists said in recent interviews, the cloning process seems to create random errors in the expression of individual genes.  Those errors can produce any number of unpredictable problems, at any time in life.
I had faith that Dr. Levin knew what he was talking about. But that was decades ago, when I never thought to ask for evidence. Now, as everyone around me goes on high-protein diets, I ask a different question. If these diets, waxing and waning in popularity for nearly 140 years, are so great, why are so many people fat? Yes, I've heard the testimonials. Who hasn't? USA Today started its Page 1 article on Sept. 21 with a dieter who ''had two eggs and eight strips of bacon for breakfast, smoked ribs and pork rinds for lunch and two quarter-pound cheeseburgers (no buns) and pork rinds for dinner.'' And, he lost 100 pounds. Time offered a similar account in November. And just last week, Science Times published an essay by a reporter who had lost 28 pounds much the same way. It is hard to avoid being swept away by such powerful stories. The disclaimers of scientists and nutritionists that often accompany the glowing articles on high-protein diets can look like the pedantic grumbling of professional naysayers.
Dr. Schatzberg of Stanford agrees, acknowledging that ''We need new theories.'' ''We're getting closer but we're not there yet,'' he said. Of Mice and Men
The government should sponsor small clinical trials on whether testosterone therapy can improve conditions like frailty, weakness, failing memories and loss of sexual function in aging men with low levels of the hormone, a committee of the National Academy of Sciences said yesterday. But large long-term studies to see if testosterone can prevent such conditions should be deferred until there is evidence that it works as a treatment, the committee added. The report, by the National Academies' Institute of Medicine, answers a question from the National Institutes of Health, which wanted to know what it should do to forestall a potential disaster as more and more men take testosterone without knowing whether it helps or harms. Dr. Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging, which would conduct the studies, said he accepted the committee's advice. ''We intend to move forward quickly,'' Dr. Hodes said. Other experts on testosterone had mixed reactions, with some saying smaller studies would slow research while others said the research would move too fast.
Leading medical experts praised the study, appearing in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, saying it was well designed and large enough to put the question to a rigorous test. Although other studies have looked at the effect of group support on cancer patients' survival, they tended to be poorly designed and too small to be definitive, said Dr. Jimmie Holland, the chairwoman of the department of psychiatry and behavioral science at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. This one, Dr. Holland said, is different. ''It is a beautiful study, totally well controlled,'' she said. Dr. Harmon Eyre, who is chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, also praised the study. ''I think it's quite conclusive,'' Dr. Eyre said. Dr. Holland said she welcomed the finding. ''There has been this ethos, 'You have to think positively, you have to go to your group, you have to talk about your cancer,' '' Dr. Holland said. But, she said, ''Lots of people don't like groups.'' Now, she said, ''You don't need to feel your life is shortened if you don't go to a group.''  And those who do not join groups should not be castigated for having a bad attitude, she added.
Taco salads at Taco Bell? More calories than a Big Mac, they learned. And peanut butter? Esther Castro Rodriguez, who joined the program with her 10-year-old son, Christian, said she was reeling after learning that peanut butter was in the red category. ''I thought that because it was vegetable oil it was good,'' Mrs. Rodriguez said. The program was part of a nationwide response to an increasing alarm over the growing girth of American children. In recent years, public health officials have been warning that in all age ranges and in all income groups, children are getting fatter. And no one is sure what to do about it. In the Stanford program, one idea is to make families aware of where calories lurk. At a recent meeting of the Stanford group in East Palo Alto, Calif., about two dozen beaming parents and shy children sat politely talking about the enormous changes they were making in what they ate and how they prepared it and about the social obstacles -- like dinner at grandmother's house or lunch at school -- yet to be overcome.
The first surprise was just how sick people were, and for how long. Instead of inferring health from causes of death on death certificates, Dr. Fogel and his colleagues looked at health throughout life. They used the daily military history of each regiment in which each veteran served, which showed who was sick and for how long; census manuscripts; public health records; pension records; doctors' certificates showing the results of periodic examinations of the pensioners; and death certificates. They discovered that almost everyone of the Civil War generation was plagued by life-sapping illnesses, suffering for decades. And these were not some unusual subset of American men -- 65 percent of the male population ages 18 to 25 signed up to serve in the Union Army. ''They presumably thought they were fit enough to serve,'' Dr. Fogel said. Even teenagers were ill. Eighty percent of the male population ages 16 to 19 tried to sign up for the Union Army in 1861, but one out of six was rejected because he was deemed disabled.
Could the F.D.A. even handle an onslaught of applications from academic researchers? ''This is clearly something we are going to have to look into,'' Dr. Lepay said. But, he added, the issue was discussed in the agency recently and ''the unanimous opinion was that they universally encouraged'' seeking agency approval. Some who have worked at the F.D.A. said that was a change of attitude. In the past, they said, the agency has not been eager to take on the extra work of reviewing applications to do basic research. Jerome Halperin, the president and chief executive of the Food and Drug Law Institute, a nonprofit organization in Washington, said that when he was at the F.D.A., in the late 1970's and early 1980's, officials decided that it simply was not worth their time to vigorously regulate basic research at universities. ''We tried to clear out of the system things that did not provide useful information for drug development and did not raise the level of safety concern,'' Mr. Halperin said. ''Most of the academic experiments were of much lower orders of risk.''
Dr. Strauss, for example, who does research on pediatric obesity and directs the pediatric weight-control program at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, said he had no data on whether the children and teenagers who came for the sessions with him, a nutritionist and a behavioral counselor, could keep off any weight they lost. ''What we set as a goal is that three, four months from now you look back and see that you're eating better, you're more active,'' Dr. Strauss said. ''Then you can say you've been successful and you can see what your weight does.'' Teaching Life Control One of the few who has gathered data on the success of weight-loss programs for children is Dr. Leonard Epstein, a professor of pediatric, social and preventive medicine at the State University of New York in Buffalo. It is his view that most fat children remain fat. In the one study he did with a control group of children who were not treated, Dr. Epstein found that 25 percent to 30 percent of the children in his program lost weight to the extent that they were not obese and kept it off for a decade. Only 4 percent of the children in the control group lost weight and kept it off.
Dr. Judith Campisi, a researcher who studies aging at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, cautioned that the investigators have not yet proved that their genetic alteration mimics the mechanism that enables caloric restriction to extend life. But, she said, if it does, it suggests an interesting future. After all, she said, few people can -- or would even want to -- starve themselves for their entire lives just to live longer. But, Dr. Campisi said, with the gene, ''if it's working the way they think it's working, then here's a target for drug intervention.'' And, she added, ''I think that's the most important thing about the work.''
People with ruptured disks in their lower backs usually recover whether or not they have surgery, researchers are reporting today. The study, a large trial, found that surgery appeared to relieve pain more quickly but that most people recovered eventually and that there was no harm in waiting. And that, surgeons said, is likely to change medical practice. The study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association, is the only large and well-designed trial to compare surgery for sciatica with waiting. The study was controversial from the start, with many surgeons saying they knew that the operation worked and that it would be unethical for their patients to participate in such a study. In the end, though, neither waiting nor surgery was a clear winner, and most patients could safely decide what to do based on personal preference and level of pain. Although many patients did not stay with their assigned treatment, most fared well with whatever treatment they had.
Frailty, Dr. Harris explains, involves exhaustion, weakness, weight loss and a loss of muscle mass and strength. It is, she says, a grim prognosis whose causes were little understood. ''It means that some people spend a long time in a period of their life where they have lost function,'' Dr. Harris says. ''People find that very distressing, and there is a tremendous health care cost.'' Now, though, scientists are surprised to find that, in many cases, a single factor -- undetected cardiovascular disease -- is often a major reason people become frail. They may not have classic symptoms like a heart attack or chest pains or a stroke. But cardiovascular disease may have partly blocked blood vessels in the brain, the legs, the kidneys or the heart. Those obstructions, in turn, can result in exhaustion or mental confusion or weakness or a slow walking pace. Investigators say that there is a ray of hope in the finding -- if cardiovascular disease is central to many of the symptoms of old age, it should be possible to slow or delay or even prevent many of these changes by treating the medical condition.
The question for journalists and the public is, What makes research news? Is it a paper in a prestigious journal on animal studies? Is it a report on the first few patients to receive a treatment in a Phase 1 study, publicized at a meeting? Is it the result of much larger study asking if the treatment is effective? The families of Alzheimer's patients may want to know everything of interest, as soon as it happens. But medical experts say they worry about creating false hopes, followed by cynicism if, as history shows is extremely likely, a drug or treatment that is being tested in a Phase 1 study never makes it to the market. REFLECTIONS
''This is the first provably unbreakable code that is really efficient,'' Dr. Rabin said. ''We have proved that the adversary is helpless.'' Dr. Richard Lipton, a computer science professor at Princeton, who is visiting this year at the Georgia Institute of Technology, said, ''It's like in the old 'Mission Impossible,' where the message blows up and disappears.'' Someone who uses one of today's commercially available coding systems, Dr. Lipton explained, uses the same key -- mathematical formulas for encoding and decoding -- over and over. Eventually, they may be forced, perhaps by a court order, to give up the key. Or the key may be stolen. But with Dr. Rabin's system, the message stays secret forever because the code uses a stream of random numbers that are plugged into the key for encoding and decoding. The numbers are never stored in a computer's memory, so they essentially vanish as the message is being encrypted and decrypted.
Then, about eight months later, health care workers were dumbfounded to receive an e-mail message from the hospital administration informing them that the whole thing was a false alarm. Not a single case of whooping cough was confirmed with the definitive test, growing the bacterium, Bordetella pertussis, in the laboratory. Instead, it appears the health care workers probably were afflicted with ordinary respiratory diseases like the common cold. Now, as they look back on the episode, epidemiologists and infectious disease specialists say the problem was that they placed too much faith in a quick and highly sensitive molecular test that led them astray. Infectious disease experts say such tests are coming into increasing use and may be the only way to get a quick answer in diagnosing diseases like whooping cough, Legionnaire's, bird flu, tuberculosis and SARS, and deciding whether an epidemic is under way. There are no national data on pseudo-epidemics caused by an overreliance on such molecular tests, said Dr. Trish M. Perl, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins and past president of the Society of Health Care Epidemiologists of America. But, she said, pseudo-epidemics happen all the time. The Dartmouth case may have been one the largest, but it was by no means an exception, she said.
While Dr. Netz acknowledges that his findings cannot be proved with absolute certainty, he has presented the work to other scholars, and they say they agree with his interpretation. On a recent snowy Sunday morning at Princeton University, three dozen academics gathered to hear Dr. Netz speak, and then congratulated him, saying his arguments made sense. ''I'm convinced,'' said Dr. Stephen Menn, a McGill University historian of ancient mathematics, in an interview at the end of the two-hour session. Among all of Archimedes' works, the Stomachion has attracted the least attention, ignored or dismissed as unimportant or unintelligible. Only a tiny fragment of the introduction survived, and as far as anyone could tell, it seemed to be about an ancient children's puzzle -- also known as the Stomachion -- that involved putting strips of paper together in different ways to make different shapes. It made no sense for a man of Archimedes' stature to care about such a game. As a result, Dr. Netz said, ''people said, 'We don't know what it is about.' ''
At the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine of Eastern Virginia Medical School, a large fertility center in Norfolk, doctors have helped half a dozen couples over the past year, said Dr. William E. Gibbons, the director. The institute does not advertise the service. ''It's just a low-key process,'' he said. So far, one woman has become pregnant with twins, but she had a miscarriage, he said. None of the women have been infected, he noted. Dr. Sauer said he first considered helping men with the virus in 1997, after a Florida woman, Carol Madeiros, sought his services. Her husband, Lawrence, was infected, but the couple had finally found a doctor willing to treat them secretly, despite the state law, using a procedure called sperm washing to separate the sperm from the seminal fluid that harbors the virus. The couple even bought their own cryotank to keep their washed sperm frozen in liquid nitrogen, far from those of the doctor's other patients.
Still, Dr. Wennberg and his colleagues say the disparities are too stark to be explained entirely by such factors. In a paper published in February in the journal Health Affairs, they wrote that Medicare's typical lifetime spending for a 65-year-old in Miami is more than $50,000 higher than for a 65-year-old in Minneapolis. In a further analysis, they found that in Miami, where medical services are particularly abundant, the federal Medicare program pays more than twice as much per person per year as it does in Minneapolis: $7,847 in Miami, $3,663 in Minneapolis. Nor can the gap be explained by regional differences in medical costs, said Dr. Elliott S. Fisher, an author of the paper who is co-director of the Outcomes Group at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt., and a professor of medicine at Dartmouth. Older Miamians simply went to doctors and hospitals more often. In their last six months of life, they had more than six times as many visits to medical specialists as those in Minneapolis, spent twice as much time in the hospital and were admitted to intensive care units more than twice as often.
For years, it was a medical truism that the earlier cancer could be detected, the better. Most cancers would inevitably worsen if left untreated, the theory went. Spontaneous remissions were so rare as to be almost unheard of. But last week, those assumptions were shattered, at least in the case of a childhood cancer. A screening test that looked as if it would save children from terrible deaths from a cancer of the nervous system utterly failed to fulfill its promise. Now the story of that screening and questions about tests for adult cancers like mammography and a blood test for prostate cancer are ushering in a broader debate about cancer screening in general, with questions about what is known of the benefits and risks of tests that look for cancers in healthy people with no symptoms. The questions are pressing, because cancer remains a leading killer. In 1998, the most recent year for which data are available, 541,519 Americans died of cancer. Men have a 43 percent chance of developing cancer in their lifetime and for women the lifetime risk is 38 percent.
But opponents say that for all but about five or six of the conditions, it is not known whether the treatments help or how often a baby will test positive but never show signs of serious disease. There is a danger, they say, of children with mild versions of illnesses being treated needlessly and aggressively for more serious forms and suffering dire health consequences. And both sides agree that the tests unintentionally pick up about 25 other conditions, in addition to the 29 that the screening is intended to find. These additional conditions show up as abnormalities, but no one knows what they mean. It is not known whether they are associated with a disease or, if so, what the effects will be. The federal advisory group recommended informing the parents of such results. But that advice, too, is controversial. ''Giving parents the result, saying, 'Here's the mutation; we are not sure what the outcome will be,' is better than not telling,'' said Sharon Terry, president and chief executive of the Genetic Alliance, an advocacy group for people with genetic disorders. Ms. Terry said it was paternalistic for doctors to presume that it was better for parents not to know.
Dr. Kiel and Dr. David Karasik, his colleague at the Hebrew Rehabilitation Center and a genetic epidemiologist at Harvard, are investigating another possible marker: the hand. They have developed a scorecard based on changes they can see in X-rays of things like bone spurs in the joints. They are studying hand X-rays taken in the 1960's from participants in the federal Framingham study, which follows residents of Framingham, Mass., and keeps records of their health. The hope is that those with lower hand-aging scores lived longer than others who were the same age but had higher scores. Even an initial assessment of this hypothesis will take time. Dr. Karasik says he has read about 2,000 hand X-rays and has about 1,700 to go. He is cautious about his chances for success, noting that the National Institute on Aging has invested much time and money looking for a biological marker of aging, but nothing has panned out yet.
While this may not be a problem for people who can afford fee-for-service plans, which typically are far more expensive than other health insurance, it can be devastating for the uninsured. ''If you're a partner in a law firm you can afford to pay more than your legal secretary can,'' said Dr. Darcy Hansen, an internist in private practice in Washington. ''But,'' she said,  ''it's the uninsured who really falter.'' Dr. Hansen said the pattern began about 10 or 15 years ago when she started negotiating with managed care companies. ''I thought it was the wave of the future,'' she said. ''I have a lot of poor patients, a lot of single moms who don't have a huge income. I thought that if they could pay $5 for an office visit they were more likely to come in than if they have to pay a $400 or $500 bill,'' she said, referring to the co-payment, the  amount a patient might have to pay when a managed care company covers virtually the entire bill.
''You have to be able to shoot a gun with either hand,'' he explained. But as time passed, Mr. Collins continued to be plagued by numbness in his left hand and on the left side of his face. He wanted to return to work -- ''I'm doing great,'' he said this month -- but the Police Department insisted that he retire, telling him, he said, ''it's an officer safety issue.'' The rest of the patients in the stroke units at the two hospitals that day were less fortunate: almost certain to live, but also almost certain to end up with brain damage. Some would have to spend time at a rehabilitation center. On average, said Dr. Brendan E. Conroy, medical director of the stroke recovery program at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, which is attached to the Washington Hospital Center, a third of the Washington hospital's stroke patients die, a third go home and a third come to him.
To the uninitiated, ethics in science can sound as straightforward as the West Point honor code: a cadet will not lie, cheat, steal or tolerate those who do. Just substitute ''scientist'' for ''cadet,'' and that should be it. But the 50 or so graduate students taking Dr. Francis L. Macrina's ethics course at Virginia Commonwealth University are getting quite a different view of research ethics, one that asks troubling questions about professional relationships and how to draw moral lines in the sand if their own careers are at stake. It is a view that reflects a growing realization among researchers that the real ethics issues in science are not so much the scandals that rock the field periodically -- charges of outright fabrications, invented data, theft of another's research. Instead, they say, they worry about more insidious problems that can corrupt science from within and push promising researchers who are uninformed about the rules out the door.
In a telephone interview, Dr. McClellan said he was surprised to be so roundly praised. ''I thought I managed to tick everybody off,'' he said. ''It's one of the things that's kind of freeing about this job. We get criticized no matter what we do.'' But, he said, he wants to continue the agency's long tradition of ''getting the science right.'' ''A lot of people have a pretty cynical view of Washington, but I really don't,'' Dr. McClellan said. Some find him hard to pigeonhole. For example, consumer groups objected and large drug companies applauded when he warned that it was illegal to import prescription drugs from Canada. But the opposite happened when he changed regulations to make generic drugs available sooner when a drug's patent expired. With foods, Dr. McClellan and his staff examined whether nutritional science could justify new claims. In the first change to food labels in a decade, last year he announced a proposal for labels to list so-called trans fats, which can increase cholesterol levels, a move that angered some companies. But, in an action favored by food manufacturers, he would allow them to list qualified claims about the health benefits of foods and nutrients.
Her prize-winning paper appeared in Review of Economic Studies. And she ended up with a job as an assistant professor at Princeton. Now, others papers have appeared, examining the effects of changed laws on compulsory education in Sweden, Denmark, England and Wales. In every country, compelling children to spend a longer time in school led to better health. ''You might think that forcing someone to go to school who does not want to be there may not be the same thing as going to school because you want to,'' Dr. Lleras-Muney said. ''That did not seem to be the case.'' Not everyone was convinced. Victor Fuchs, a health economist at Stanford, points out that it is not clear how or why education would lead to a longer life. And, he said, there are other mysteries. For example, women increased their years of schooling more than men have in recent decades. But men are catching up with women in their life spans.
The report urges that doctors and patients pay attention to bones throughout life. Children and adolescents need a proper diet and exercise to stimulate bone growth. For adults, eating properly and staying active can maintain bone strength. The report recommends that people over 50 who are at high risk for osteoporosis -- women with a strong family history of the disease, for example -- and anyone over 65 have a bone density test. Older people should also take simple measures to prevent falls, like removing small rugs from their homes. But paying close attention to fractures is near the top of most experts' list of largely ignored medical interventions. ''When you see people over 50 who fall and break a wrist bone, you need to stop and take a look,'' said Dr. Richard H. Carmona, the surgeon general. ''We need to take one step back and say, 'Why should that bone have broken from a simple fall?'''
Undaunted, in 1994 Dr. El-Rashidy started a second company, Pentech, got approval from the Food and Drug Administration to investigate the drug, and found about 50 impotent volunteers who agreed to try it. Unfortunately, he said, they had both effects: they vomited and they had erections. ''That was not fun,'' he said. Going back to the lab, Dr. El-Rashidy worked on new ways to deliver the drug, finally ending up with a tablet that dissolved slowly under the tongue. He thought he had largely solved the vomiting problem, while keeping the drug's ability to help men get erections. At that point, at the end of 1995, Dr. El-Rashidy needed to find a company to conduct large studies to see if the drug was effective enough to get approval from the drug agency. His company, with only about 10 people at that time and with limited resources, could not conduct studies of thousands of people.
Suspicions grew when the Pentagon sporadically increased its estimates of how many troops might have been exposed to toxic substances. But researchers who were asked to investigate threw up their hands in dismay. There was so little medical and exposure data that scientists could not fully investigate possible causes of the symptoms. They said they lacked crucial data on the troops' health before, during and after the war, they lacked necessary information on who might have been exposed to what in the Persian Gulf, and doctors with the V.A. did not have clinical guidelines for assessing veterans' health. With data that were skimpy and unreliable, it was almost impossible to conduct good studies. ''We didn't have the base line information we needed,'' said Dr. William Winkenwerder Jr., the assistant secretary of defense for health affairs. ''We didn't have good capture of events in the theater, and there wasn't a systematic capture of information when they came out.'' Until then, he said, such data were not viewed as important. ''It was never viewed as a critical thing to do for the service member,'' he said.
''There is a lot of controversy as to why,'' he said. ''I don't think anyone thinks it has to do with the skill of the surgeon doing the original operation.'' Instead, Dr. Birkmeyer explained, the key may be the tumor board, a group of medical specialists who review each patient's proposed treatment program. At medical centers that see large numbers of patients, the tumor boards, he said, ''may be better at matching patients with therapies.'' ''The totality of evidence leaves little doubt that for most serious cancers, you improve your outlook by going to an experienced center,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. Yet, Dr. Downey said, most of his patients do not ask about such things. ''And when they do, they're apologetic,'' he said. Instead, they tell him they went to Memorial Sloan-Kettering because a local doctor told them to, or because they know someone who was treated there and did well. The most common reason, though, is the hospital's famous name. ''As soon as they hear the word 'cancer,' they head for Memorial,'' Dr. Downey said.
Zoe Foods says its soy cereals and bars ''have helped thousands of women overcome their menopausal symptoms.'' Another company, SoyToy, claims its soy juicer makes milk from soybeans in 25 minutes. Soy, it says, alleviates symptoms of menopause, increases bone mass and decreases the risk of heart disease. GlaxoSmithKline, the large drug company best known for its prescription drugs, touts the benefits of another diet supplement, black cohosh, which it markets as Remifemin. The package states that Remifemin is ''drug free'' and ''estrogen free'' and that it is good for hot flashes, night sweats, mood swings, irritability and related occasional sleeplessness. A footnote informs consumers, ''These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration.'' Other companies offer custom blends of actual estrogens and progestins. Individual states, rather than the F.D.A., normally regulate these products as they regulate pharmacies. Dr. Schiff, at Massachusetts General, pointed to a flier from one such company, the Women's International Pharmacy, advertising ''bio-identical hormones'' and ''customized prescriptions'' and claiming that its product is safer than hormones sold by drug companies. ''They have no evidence for that,'' Dr. Schiff said.
''I'd always imagined this system had a fixed architecture, like a plumbing system,'' he said. ''A certain number of pipes were laid out or fixed.'' He said he had thought the flow of signals in the hypothalamus was regulated by the equivalent of opening or closing valves. But that was not what happened. ''In this case, the brain is adding and subtracting pieces of pipe,'' Dr. Friedman said. ''Nerves are not appearing or disappearing, but the way they are connected to each other is. ''Right now there is an assumption on the part of the public that differences in weight are accounted for by discipline.'' It is thought, he said, that with will power, anyone can lose weight and keep it off. ''That assumes that the drive to eat is the same in all people,'' Dr. Friedman said, ''but this says there is not only a dynamic system that controls weight but that the wiring diagram is different in the obese. It at least raises the question, To what extent is the wiring diagram different in obese humans?''
Brillat-Savarin continued, ''He doesn't even leave us potatoes or macaroni! Who would have thought this of a lover of good food who seemed so pleasant? '' 'What's this I hear?' I exclaim, putting on my severest face, which I do perhaps once a year. 'Very well then; eat! Get fat! Become ugly and thick, and asthmatic, finally die in your own melted grease.'' The Frenchman's recipe for good health was only one of many to come. A decade later, the Rev. Sylvester Graham exhorted Americans to eat simple foods like grains and vegetables and to drink water. Beef and pork, salt and pepper, spices, tea and coffee, alcohol, he advised, all lead to gluttony. Bread should be unleavened, and made with bran to avoid the problem of yeast, which turns sugar into alcohol, he continued. It is also important, he said, to seek out fresh organic fruits and vegetables, grown in soil without fertilizers.
At a recent group visit at a Kaiser Permanente clinic in Wheat Ridge, Colo., 17 elderly people with a variety of ailments began arriving early, eagerly settling into plastic chairs in a windowless room. One couple, Kenneth and Edith Carrier, came even though it was their 54th wedding anniversary. ''It's a heck of a way to spend your wedding anniversary,'' said the 80-year-old Mr. Carrier. But, he added, ''We have a great time.'' For Dr. Scott, the success of the group visits seemed almost too good to be true. ''We went back and looked at the program and said, 'My God, how does this work?' '' he said. One reason, he decided, was that the patients were not afraid to ask questions. In an ordinary office visit, he said, ''Many folks think the doctor is so busy that they don't want to ask anything.'' Just as important, the patients help each other, Dr. Scott said.
In contrast, her husband, Donald Berry, who heads the biostatistics department at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, is among the distinct minority of people who deliberately refuse screening tests for fear of the harm of overdiagnosis. ''I have this philosophy about looking for things,'' Dr. Berry said. ''I do go to the doctor if I am sick, but I don't have routine checkups. I may live to regret it, but the evidence for most of these things does not exist.'' Health
''Whatever is going on with these patients,'' he said, ''if it is unresponsive to antibiotics, it is unlikely that it is untreated Lyme disease.'' In contrast, antibiotics have been shown to work extraordinarily well when, for instance, the Lyme organism has demonstrably infected the brain, Dr. Dattwyler said. But some who have treated hundreds of patients with long-term antibiotics, like Dr. Sam L. Donta of Boston University Medical Center, were not convinced. The antibiotics in the studies were not given for a long enough time, Dr. Donta said, and he would have chosen different ones. Perhaps all that the studies show, he said, is ''that this particular treatment doesn't work.'' Dr. Brian Fallon, an associate professor of psychiatry at Columbia University, is directing another  study of chronic Lyme disease that focuses on patients who have problems with fatigue, their memory and their ability to think. In his study, also supported by the National Institutes of Health, the patients receive intravenous antibiotics for 10 weeks, or a placebo.
Prempro is approved for the prevention of osteoporosis and for the relief of symptoms of menopause, like hot flashes, but doctors had hoped it might also protect against heart disease and other diseases of aging, including Alzheimer's. Many women were advised to start taking Prempro at menopause and to continue for the rest of their lives. But Prempro is not the only hormone replacement on the market, leaving many doctors and women with questions about whether other drugs, which are slightly different formulations, have similar risks. There are also questions about who should take Prempro and for how long. Prempro's label was written on the basis of older studies that did not provide the sort of precise information as the new study. Those studies did indicate possible risks of heart attacks, strokes and breast cancer, however, and that is included on the drug's label. Now, the food and drug agency is looking at the new data.
Other people buy supplements that purport to have the same effects as steroids. Whether this is true is not known, said Dr. Paul Coates, director of the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. ''There are a lot of anecdotes that support both benefits and harms,'' Dr. Coates said. ''Is that evidence? That's what we're dealing with.'' The result has been subcultures of American society where, with a wink and a nod, men, and some women, routinely take the drugs. Some, Dr. Pope said, are models in fitness magazines or trainers in gyms, who insist that they got their bodies just by hard work. Some are gay men who may have started taking anabolic steroids to combat the muscle wasting and low energy that can result from an H.I.V. infection or antiviral drugs. With steroids, many hope to hide signs of the disease with muscles that suggest they are bursting with health.
''This is a spurious subset result if I've ever seen one,'' Dr. Berry said. ''I wouldn't spend a nickel trying to confirm it.'' Correction:  February 24, 2006, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a study of the effectiveness of glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate to ease arthritis pain referred to them incorrectly. They are dietary supplements, not drugs.
Rimonabant blocks a protein in brain cells that allows cannabis, the active ingredient in marijuana, to work. It also blocks the body's own versions of cannabis, the so-called endocannabinoids. Marijuana is supposed to increase appetite. So a drug that blocks cannabis, it seems logical, should suppress the appetite. Obese people have more receptors for endocannabinoids than thin people, said Dr. F. Xavier Pi-Sunyer, a professor of medicine at Columbia University and the principal investigator of a large rimonabant study in the United States and Canada. The drug does not completely block these receptors, Dr. Pi-Sunyer said. The idea of blocking these receptors worked in animals. For example, mice that were genetically engineered so they could not respond to endocannabinoids ate less and were thinner than normal. And when scientists at Sanofi-Aventis gave rimonabant to obese mice, the animals ate much less, lost 20 percent of their body weight, and had lower levels of blood glucose and lipids, risk factors for diabetes and heart disease.
Researchers had a full gamut of responses to the unexpected findings, being reported today in The Journal of the American Medical Association. Some saw the report as a long-needed reality check on what they consider the nation's near-hysteria over fat. ''I love it,'' said Dr. Steven Blair, president and chief executive of the Cooper Institute, a research and educational organization in Dallas that focuses on preventive medicine. ''There are people who have made up their minds that obesity and overweight are the biggest public health problem that we have to face,'' Dr. Blair said. ''These numbers show that maybe it's not that big.'' Others simply did not believe the findings. Dr. JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, which is affiliated with Harvard, pointed to the university's own study of nurses that found mortality risks in being overweight and even greater risks in being obese. (That study involved mostly white women and used statistical methods different from those in the newly reported research.)
But, he said, ''Certain things you put out of your mind because life is so good.'' Preventing Cancer Previous articles in this series explored whether diet, exercise, stress and environmental factors matter in prevention. The articles remain online, and Gina Kolata discusses cancer in a video feature: nytimes.com/science. Preventing Cancer Correction:  December 28, 2005, Wednesday  A picture caption with an article in Science Times yesterday about the genetic underpinnings of cancer misstated the age of a New York City firefighter whose myelogenous leukemia was diagnosed in 1996. As the article noted, the firefighter, Jay Weinstein, was 36 at the time of his diagnosis, not today.
Scientists eagerly looked for evidence that the chemicals mediated any and all sorts of pleasure. Meanwhile, Dr. Snyder said, a running craze had begun, with enthusiasts exalting in the wonderful feelings they said exercise elicited. ''Jogging was first becoming popular in the United States, and everyone was talking about the runner's high,'' Dr. Snyder said. ''They said: 'Well, I have a high. It must be endorphins.' '' Indeed, scientists noted that endorphin levels in the blood rose with exercise. But that finding is meaningless, they say. ''Endorphins in the blood are irrelevant,'' Dr. Snyder said. They do not pass from the circulating blood into the brain. It is easy to see how the confusion arose, Dr. Akil said, because endorphins are released into the blood during running as part of the body's normal stress response. Scientists still do not understand the function of endorphins in the blood, Dr. Akil said, but many erroneously assume that if their levels rise in the blood, they rise in the brain, too.
Drugs to prevent or treat osteoporosis include bisphosphonates like Merck's Fosamax, which permanently bind to bone; parathyroid hormone, which is generally reserved for severe osteoporosis; Eli Lilly's Evista, which acts like estrogen on bone but also can cause hot flashes and blood clots; and calcitonin, a less effective treatment that is administered as a nasal spray. Worldwide sales of osteoporosis drugs reached $3.98 billion last year. There are no national data on the number of people with osteopenia who are treated. But Merck estimates, from its own market research, that about 8 million women have been found to have osteopenia and about a third of them are taking an osteoporosis drug. Osteopenia was defined in June 1992 at a World Health Organization meeting in order to prompt governments to pay attention to the problem of bone loss. Dr. L. Joseph Melton, an osteoporosis epidemiologist at the Mayo Clinic who attended the meeting, said the group decided to identify a new condition, osteopenia, for people 50 and older with lower than average bone density who did not have osteoporosis. It would encompass a bone density that was one standard deviation below that of a normal young adult. (The group also defined osteoporosis as 2.5 standard deviations or more below that reference point.)
The study, by researchers at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital and published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, involved more than 31,000 people in seven countries. The participants included smokers and former smokers, but also included people in Japan who had never smoked but had the scans as part of annual physical exams. The scans found 484 lung cancers, 412 of which were at a very early stage. Then the researchers tracked those cancer patients for an average of about three years after the cancer was detected. After three years, most patients were still alive. The researchers projected that more than 80 percent of those with early-stage cancer would live at least 10 years after their cancer was diagnosed. Supporters of the findings include Dr. James Mulshine, a professor of internal medicine at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. The study design may not have been perfect, he said, and there is more to be learned from other studies that are now under way, but he said the data from this one was convincing.
''I was able,'' Mr. Dieffenbacher said, ''to put those chips aside and go about my business.'' Correction:  March 12, 2003, Wednesday  A front-page article yesterday about an experimental drug that proved effective against severe peanut allergies misstated the surname of an allergist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who said he would offer it to patients despite its cost, more than $10,000 a year. He is Dr. John J. Murray, not Barron.
Panel members said they worried about the paucity of information on how likely a silicone implant was to rupture or what sort of complications could be expected after two years or so. Yet the agency generally allows device makers to start selling their products after they complete 2 years of a 10-year study. And Inamed had worked with the government to prepare the data the agency requested. ''This was unbelievably difficult, much more difficult than I had ever anticipated,'' said a panel member, Dr. Benjamin O. Anderson, the director of the Breast Health Center in Seattle and associate professor of surgery at the University of Washington. He voted in favor of approval, he said, because ''ultimately I believe in the right to choose and informed consent.'' One panel member, Dr. Nancy A. Dubler, who directs the division of bioethics at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, changed her mind hours before the vote.
Researchers also point out that many overweight people are healthy and even those who are not often need to lose only small amounts of weight -- as little as 5 or 10 pounds -- to resolve health problems like high blood pressure and elevated levels of sugar in the blood. Between the extremes exemplified by Ms. Sabo and Ms. Haworth are the families taking part in Dr. Robinson's experimental program in East Palo Alto. They are eager, enthusiastic and convinced that weight loss is of paramount importance. They are also well aware of the struggles ahead. Mrs. Sanchez, for example, worries about her mother, who lives nearby and often invites her family for dinner. ''If we eat just a little bit, she is offended,'' Mrs. Sanchez said. ''She feels like she has cooked all day for nothing. She is so happy when everyone is at the table and is asking for more.''
But, to the investigators' surprise, only one animal was infected, a healthy 23-year-old male from Gombe. And he had a virus that did not resemble the human AIDS virus. It was, instead, like the virus isolated previously from the captive chimpanzee of unknown origin. The scientists reported their results in the Jan. 18 issue of the journal Science. Other AIDS experts were equally astonished. ''It's quite incredible,''said Dr. Edward Holmes of Oxford University. There are three possible explanations, he added. There may be widely infected chimpanzee populations, but they are so isolated that they did not spread their infection to other chimpanzees. Or chimpanzee populations that once harbored the virus have gone extinct, possibly because they were hunted and eaten and their habitat was destroyed by development. Or, most puzzling of all, perhaps there really is very little infection in chimpanzees. But, scientists ask, if infected chimps are so scarce, how did the virus jump to humans? The scientists know, from looking at genetic variants of human AIDS, that the virus infected humans on at least several occasions before becoming a full-fledged epidemic.
That is what happened this spring to a 65-year-old English professor from Connecticut. He could hardly believe his P.S.A. level was high, he could hardly believe he was having a biopsy. Then he learned he had cancer. He was sitting in his office when the phone rang, his doctor calling with the news. ''I was shocked,'' he said. The doctor, he added, ''tried valiantly to explain to me the nature of the disease, but I probably heard about 10 percent of the conversation.'' He decided to keep his cancer secret because he did not want his colleagues, friends and neighbors to pity him or gossip about him. Soon the professor found himself sitting in doctors' offices with his wife, hearing what might be in store for him. He found himself poring over the Internet and trying to decide among some not very appealing treatment alternatives. He also found himself confiding in the owner of his town's liquor store, who had recently gone through the agonizing process from diagnosis to treatment to recovery. ''We have developed this relationship,'' the professor said. ''We talk about wine and then we go immediately to the prostate.''
That story began more than a decade ago, when Marlo Brown, a resident of Petaluma, Calif., who ran a shelter for cats, was astonished to see that several of them were showing symptoms that looked like AIDS. She took them to a veterinarian, who was baffled. So she took the cats to Dr. Niels Pedersen, an animal virologist at the University of California at Davis, telling him they had AIDS. She turned out to be right. A year later, in August 1987, Dr. Pedersen and a research colleague, Dr. Janet Yamamoto, found the virus. It is a close cousin of the human AIDS virus, although it does not infect people. But where did it come from? Were wild cats infected too? And, if so, did that mean that endangered species like lions and pumas were going to get a version of AIDS, like the domestic cats, and be exterminated? Dr. Stephen O'Brien, a cat expert who is chief of the Laboratory of Genomic Diversity at the National Cancer Institute in Frederick, Md., intrigued and alarmed, began looking for the virus in a repository of serum from thousands of wild cats, including cheetahs, lions, ocelots and pumas. To his great surprise, it was everywhere, with a vast majority of wild cats carrying the virus.
Doctors also say the level of alarm among patients, as well as some physicians and dentists, is itself alarming. ''The whole thing has spun out of control,'' said Dr. Ethel Siris, director of the Toni Stabile Osteoporosis Center at Columbia University. The Food and Drug Administration is aware of the issue, said Laura Alvey, a spokeswoman, and has required that all bisphosphonate labels disclose the link to osteonecrosis of the jaw. The problem is that patients cannot easily abandon the drugs. Cancer patients, mostly those with multiple myeloma and breast cancer whose disease has spread to their bones, generally take one of two bisphosphonates, Zometa or the older Aredia, intravenously. The drugs, doctors say, largely prevent excruciating bone pain and fragile bones that break like kindling. Osteoporosis patients, on the other hand, usually take bisphosphonates as pills, in much lower doses. Those drugs -- Fosamax, Actonel and Boniva -- reduce the risk of fractures of the spine or hip, injuries that can create a steady downward spiral in patients' condition.
The steadily improving health of recent generations shows up in population after population and country after country. But these findings raise a fundamental question, Dr. Costa said. ''The question is, O.K., there are these differences, and yes, they are big. But why?'' she said. ''That's the million-dollar question,'' said David M. Cutler, a health economist at Harvard. ''Maybe it's the trillion-dollar question. And there is not a received answer that everybody agrees with.'' Outgrowing the Past Don Hotchkiss, a civil engineer in Las Vegas and a descendant of Civil War veterans, is an avid Civil War re-enactor. Early on, he and his brother tried to sleep in an exact replica of one of the old tents. It was too small, Mr. Hotchkiss said. He is six feet tall and stocky. His brother, a police officer in Phoenix, is thinner, but 6-foot-2. The tents were made for men who were average size then. ''In the past 145 years, we've ballooned up,'' Mr. Hotchkiss said.
''It's muddy,'' Dr. Bresalier said. ''Even people who are experts don't have the answers.''
And obesity is not just a social stigma -- it is associated with poor health, from diabetes to heart ailments to gall bladder disease. To make things worse, a hormone called leptin that was supposed to be the magic bullet for obesity, making people effortlessly lose fat while retaining muscle, looks like a bust. In a preliminary study reported last week, most people who took leptin lost little or no weight -- one fat person who took the highest dose actually gained 20 pounds. Medical experts disagree about where the nation goes from here. Some fear that without a national anti-obesity campaign, the future could hold more bad news. Others say there may in fact be a magic bullet for obesity one day, thanks to the miracles of molecular biology. And these experts say the pathway to a truly effective obesity drug is being illuminated by the very hormone, leptin, that has proved so disappointing.
After investigating the death of a young, healthy volunteer last month in a research study at Johns Hopkins University, a federal oversight agency yesterday suspended almost all the university's federally financed medical research involving human subjects. One reason for its action, the agency, the Office for Human Research Protections, said in a letter to Hopkins, was that the ethics committee that approved the study in question had failed to take proper precautions to protect its subjects. Suspending research is an unusual step. Johns Hopkins receives more federal research money than any other university, $310 million last year. But a spokeswoman for the university said she did not know how many studies or how many subjects would be affected. To resume the studies, the agency said, the university will have to address concerns raised in the letter, restructure its system for protecting human subjects and develop a plan to make sure its ethics committee and researchers are educated in the regulatory requirements for protecting human subjects. Hopkins said the agency agreed today to expedite its review of the university's response. It is not clear how long the process will take.
The company has improved its software since the study was conducted, Mr. Cascella added. The study's lead author, Dr. Joshua J. Fenton of the University of California, Davis, emphasized that women should continue to have mammograms. But, Dr. Fenton said, they may want to ask if their mammography center uses computer-aided detection. His study, he said, ''does raise concerns that technology is causing harm without clear benefit.'' The new look at computer-aided detection is the latest question mark in the changing era of breast cancer detection. New technology -- like computer-aided detection, digital mammography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound -- can be so sensitive that doctors have trouble deciding which findings are worrisome. The only screening method that has been rigorously evaluated is old-fashioned X-ray film mammograms, but it is likely to be replaced by something, or some combination of things, whose benefits and risks are largely unknown. ''We are getting ourselves out on thinner and thinner ice,'' said Dr. Suzanne W. Fletcher, an emerita professor of ambulatory care and prevention at Harvard Medical School.
In the workshop sessions and in private discussions, scientists explained why they were so impassioned and why they came to believe that genes controlled life spans. Dr. Kenyon started her quest to postpone aging with a fact that used to seem surprising: Many of the fundamental biological processes that occur in the simple roundworm, C. elegans, also occur in humans. She was a postdoctoral student when a revolution in thinking began, in the early 1980's. Scientists had discovered a small collection of genes that choreographed development in simple creatures like fruit flies and, they soon discovered, in mammals as well. By making a single change in a single gene, development could be profoundly deranged: A fly's antennae could turn into legs, for example. Worms, once thought too primitive, also turned out to have these genes. So Dr. Kenyon began pondering the genetic control of aging. Perhaps  the same genetic approach that worked with development might crack the problem of aging, she reasoned, and worms might show the way. After all, she decided, there was every reason to believe that life spans were written in the genes.
Some younger surgeons say it is often older surgeons who disparage the operation because they cannot do it. But some surgeons who do not perform the operation say those who do are using it as a marketing tool. ''This could be a lot like female hormones,'' Dr. Eric Rose, a heart surgeon who is chairman of the department of surgery at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, said as he referred to the decades of enthusiasm for hormone therapy after menopause and the shock when a large federal study found last year that the therapy conferred risks that outweighed the benefits. ''There are very strong feelings, especially among surgeons,'' Dr. Rose said. ''We're famous for often being wrong, but never uncertain.'' Like its name, pumphead, the brain injury problem is rarely mentioned in front of patients, and few ask about it. Quite a few do not even realize that there are two ways to perform bypass surgery.
''We started it,'' Dr. Verma said, speaking of the debate. Now, he said, ''we withdraw from it because we realize it is going out of control.'' Yet, he said, this time, with abortion politics entwined in the story, the public backlash may be far worse than it was with gene therapy. ''In five years, if it doesn't work out, people will turn to us and say, 'You divided the nation,' '' Dr. Verma said. THE STEM CELL DEBATE
With esophageal cancer, for example, ''you literally double your odds by going to a high-volume center,'' Dr. Birkmeyer said. The five-year survival rate for patients going to hospitals that did four or fewer esophageal operations a year was 17 percent. The five-year survival rate for patients going to hospitals that did more than 14 operations a year was 34 percent. Dr. Robert J. Downey, a thoracic surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he stopped doing operations for esophageal cancer because he was doing only about one a month, not enough, he decided, for optimal results. Yet Dr. Birkmeyer's study finds that fully a third of patients have the operation at hospitals doing four or fewer such surgeries in a year. It may not matter, Dr. Downey said, whether someone with esophageal cancer ''goes to a Memorial Sloan-Kettering or a Columbia-Presbyterian,'' two of New York's teaching hospitals. What matters, he said, is whether they go to a hospital that does more than just a few operations. With breast cancer, Dr. Birkmeyer said, women who go to medical centers that see large numbers of such patients tend to live longer than women who go to centers that see fewer.
So far, however, the study only shows that DNA vaccines are a promising approach in AIDS, not that this particular vaccine will protect people, researchers emphasized. ''This is a proof of concept,'' Dr. Siliciano said. Nonetheless, he and other AIDS experts said they were hopeful. ''We're not there yet in humans in terms of having a vaccine that can do what we can do in monkeys,'' Dr. Letvin said. But, he added, ''I think we know how to do it.''
The study results, along with two editorials, will be published in the Nov. 6 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, but the journal released them yesterday because of their clinical importance. Since so few women, in either group, had recurrences, as a new cancer in the opposite breast, as a recurrence in the original breast or as a metastasis elsewhere in the body, and since a recurrence does not necessarily mean death, the survival rates in the first few years after tamoxifen were high, for everyone. The investigators estimated that the four-year survival rate for the women taking letrozole was 96 percent and for women taking the placebo it was 94 percent. Dr. Larry Norton, the head of medical oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and one of the study investigators, said he was confident letrozole would save lives. ''Disease-free survival predicts survival. It always has. And there is a very big decrease in cancer incidence so there will be a survival difference,'' Dr. Norton said.
''Wow!'' Dr. Jenkins said. ''Now you've changed that paradigm.'' One way to do it would be to use artificial blood, which has been a longtime interest of the military. Dr. Steven Gould, a trauma surgeon who is the chairman and chief executive of Northfield Laboratories, said he began working on a blood substitute in 1969 as part of a small research team in Chicago. The Army supplied the research money, he said. The concept was simple. Oxygen is carried in blood by hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. If you got rid of the cell and just used hemoglobin, it could in theory supply tissues with oxygen on its own. But when researchers tried that approach, it ended in disaster, with injuries to major organs, including the liver and kidneys. A likely reason is that hemoglobin disables a small molecule, nitric oxide, in blood vessels, preventing them from relaxing. With narrowed blood vessels, vital organs do not get enough blood.
''It was a total surprise -- it knocked our socks off,'' Dr. Nathan said. Dr. Faustman says she still does not know where the new islet cells came from. They may have grown  from pancreas cells. Or they may have come from immature cells that originated elsewhere in the body and were stimulated to develop into islet cells by signals in the pancreas. But whatever their origin, the islet cells were working normally, raising the question of whether the same treatment strategy would work in humans. That is an ultimate goal, Dr. Nathan said, while cautioning, ''we're a long way from that.'' He estimated it would take at least a couple of years before the investigators were ready to try the most preliminary studies in humans. But, he added, he is excited. ''This is really cool,'' Dr. Nathan said. ''It provides the possibility that you could take people with Type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune diseases that are involved in the destruction of tissue and, if you interrupt the diseases, maybe these cells would regrow.''
Some leading doctors who treat arthritis patients are less concerned.  ''By and large, the drugs are very helpful,'' said Dr. Michael Lockshin, who directs the Barbara Volcker Center for Women and Rheumatic Disease at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University. Dr. Lockshin does not consult for and is not on the speaker's bureau of Merck or Pharmacia. While most patients can safely take drugs like aspirin, he added, it is impossible to predict ahead of time who will have problems with gastrointestinal bleeding, and so the cox-2 inhibitors are useful because, he said, they give doctors and patients, ''a freedom from that concern.'' Dr. John Sergent, an arthritis expert who is chief medical officer at Vanderbilt medical school, also continues to prescribe Vioxx and Celebrex and, like Dr. Lockshin, has not even suggested to Vioxx patients that they switch to Celebrex. He too is neither a consultant nor a member of the speaker's board for Merck or Pharmacia.
Her doctor, Maureen Connelly, an internist at Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates, a group practice in Boston, suggested she start taking the hormones again and then try to stop. But, Ms. Danzig said, ''every time I tried to back off completely, the symptoms came back.'' ''It happened again this year," she said. ''I backed off of a smaller dose and, whammo, the symptoms were back. Now I'm back on a full dose.'' ''I am worried,'' Ms. Danzig said. ''I'm still living with having taken it for five or six years, and I don't know what negative effect that has had.'' She said she wanted an alternative that would control her symptoms, but did not know what to do. ''I go to health food stores and there are things on the shelf, but I know nothing about them.'' ''I looked at my vitamins this morning and my two hormone replacement pills were there,'' Ms. Danzig said. ''I said, 'Boy, am I taking poison!' ''
The son of an Akron, Ohio, machinist, David Costill started out thinking that he would teach high school science and coach a swimming team. But he soon grew dissatisfied. It was 1961, and he was working in Cleveland, teaching, coaching and increasingly restless. ''One day, I came home in the afternoon,'' he said. ''I was sitting in our bare-bones apartment staring at the wall. My wife wasn't home -- she was teaching English and Spanish. And I said, Am I going to do this for the rest of my life?'' That night, he applied to the doctoral program in physiology at Ohio State University. His former college swimming coach was there and had encouraged him to come. He was summarily rejected, Dr. Costill said, confessing that his college grades had been unimpressive. ''I just was not focused,'' he said. But then, five days later, to his great surprise, he got another letter, this one accepting him with no reservations. He suspects his former coach had something to do with it. In a year, he had crammed in all the required courses for his Ph.D., and he went to the State University of New York at Cortland to teach science and coach swimming and cross-country while he did research for the doctoral degree.
Still, it is a step that is likely to be controversial. ''What is of interest, I think, in Gerry Schatten's work is the possibility that one could learn about certain types of diseases in ways that we really couldn't in humans,'' said Patricia Backlar, an ethicist at the university. ''But there's also the issue there that maybe we shouldn't do this on nonhuman primates. That's an issue. I can't resolve it for you.'' Dr. Schatten said his ultimate goal was to create colonies of monkeys that had been genetically modified to  develop a human disease. Then, he said, he could use the animals to study new treatments for humans with the disease. The evidence that the jellyfish gene got into the monkey's cells is purely molecular, Dr. Schatten said. Using an exquisitely sensitive method, polymerase chain reaction, he found the gene in cells from the  monkey's cheek, hair, urine, placenta and cord blood. But none of those cells glowed with the fluorescent protein, he reported. And, he said, he does not yet know whether the gene will be in the monkey's sperm cells, a necessity if he is to use genetically modified monkeys to produce a monkey colony.
Gerontologists say that while Mr. LaLanne may be an extreme example of what is possible, they think there is something to the ''use it or lose it'' notion of strength and endurance. ''Most of the changes that endure with aging are not inevitable, but are due to disuse,'' said Dr. Lewis A. Lipsitz, chief of gerontology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Dr. Jeremy Walston, a gerontologist at Johns Hopkins, said that while remaining strong might not prevent frailty, it could provide a crucial cushion when older people become ill. Disease can lead to a loss of muscle and a general debilitation that can tip an older person into a downward spiral of disability, ending with frailty, but those who start out strong may not fall that far. ''Skeletal muscle strength may not necessarily protect you against disease,'' Dr. Walston said. ''But it can provide you with a reserve that can get you through the tough times.''
That advice is not just for broken wrist bones, Dr. McGowan added. ''One of the ideas that people have is that you earned your fracture,'' she said. ''You tripped, or you were ice skating with your granddaughter and you fell and broke your arm. Well, how many times did your granddaughter fall and not break an arm?'' Dr. McGowan said that a fracture was ''really a sentinel event in an older person -- any fracture.'' ''I don't care if you got it falling off a bike or even in a traffic accident,'' she continued. Yet too often, she said, doctors do not send patients with broken bones to be evaluated to see why the bone broke in the first place. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons agrees. In a position statement last year, it urged members to do more than just repair fractures in older people. ''There is a terrific information gap,'' said Dr. Laura Tosi, an orthopedic surgeon at George Washington University and a member of the academy's board. ''Orthopods know how to put metal in and get people up and going, but if you don't prevent future fractures, people will end up disabled.''
The metal in the aneroid devices can fatigue, making readings inaccurate. So manufacturers recommend that they be recalibrated every six months or so, often asking that they be returned to the companies for service. But Dr. Roccella says that is seldom done. Electronic devices use physical measurements and mathematical formulas to calculate pressure, but some blood pressure experts say they are unsatisfied by the data that the companies provide. ''What is the accuracy of these and how are they recalibrated?'' Dr. Roccella asked. He said that because companies keep the algorithms secret from competitors, it is impossible for outsiders to independently assess the devices. ''This is not to say that the new digital devices cannot be accurate. And it is not to say that aneroids can't be useful,'' he said. ''But how do we know that this is so?'' In the meantime, hospitals and medical centers are switching from mercury devices and are making their own decisions about how carefully to assess their equipment.
The cancer risk associated with PCB's has been a point of contention for years. PCB's have not been proved to cause cancer in people, and industry workers who were exposed to higher levels did not have a higher cancer rate, said Dr. Michael Gallo of the Cancer Institute at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. Dr. Gallo, who receives no money from the fish or chemical industry, said PCB's were mixtures and some could cause cancer in laboratory rodents. In animals, some of the cancer-causing PCB's are blocked by others that do not cause cancer. Other contaminants, like dioxins, can also block the effects of PCB's, said Dr. Stephen Safe, professor of toxicology at Texas A&amp;M University. In addition, in laboratory tests, some PCB's can block dioxins and some chemicals in vegetables can block the cancer-causing effects of both PCB's and dioxins. ''No one is really sure how important these interactions are in the real world,'' said Dr. Mark E. Hahn, a toxicologist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who has spent 20 years working on PCB's and dioxins, with no industry support.
Lowering cholesterol far beyond the levels recommended by most doctors can substantially reduce heart patients' risk of suffering or dying of a heart attack, a study has found. The study's results, cardiologists say, will greatly change how doctors treat patients with heart disease and will provide impetus to re-evaluate how low cholesterol levels should be, even for people without heart problems. The study compared high doses of one of the most powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs, Lipitor, made by Pfizer Inc., with a less potent drug, Pravachol, made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which sponsored the trial. The patients taking Lipitor were significantly less likely to have heart attacks or to require bypass surgery or angioplasty, the study found. Both drugs are statins, a class of medications that block a cholesterol-synthesizing enzyme and are often prescribed for patients with heart problems. ''This is really a big deal,'' Dr. David Waters, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said of the findings.
Monkeys, Dr. Schatten said, can be invaluable in studies of human disorders. ''When you think of their value as a disease model or for understanding cognition or mental disorders or all sorts of diseases and disorders that appear in people, this is a very small first step,'' he said. But, he added, a darker side of the work is the questions it raises about a popular fertility treatment. The sperm injection method is a standby in fertility clinics, where it is used 10,000 to 20,000 times a year in about 200 American clinics. Discovered by accident less than a decade ago, the method, called intracytoplasmic sperm injection, or ICSI, revolutionized the treatment of male infertility. It allowed men whose sperm do not move, men whose sperm cannot penetrate an egg, and men whose sperm are not even ejaculated, to become fathers. But ICSI (pronounced ICK-see) puts whole sperm, along with whatever may be attached to them, into egg cells. Dr. Schatten noted that viruses can attach themselves to sperm and no amount of rinsing can get them off. With ICSI, these viruses would be injected directly into eggs where, his work shows, their genes could start to function. And while there is no proof so far that babies born from ICSI procedures have unusual diseases, the prospect has troubled some scientists.
Old people, he adds, do not even respond well to the vaccine. Giving it to frail nursing home residents, for example, prevents only 30 percent to 40 percent of expected flu cases, compared with the vaccine's 80 percent to 90 percent effectiveness when it is given to younger people. In fact, according to Dr. Walter Orenstein, director of Emory University's Program for Vaccine Policy and Development, one study in Britain found that the best predictor of decreased flu mortality in nursing homes was immunization of the staff, not the residents. Dr. Orenstein and others stress that no one is suggesting that the elderly be deprived of the vaccine. ''It would be difficult ethically to say to someone at the highest risk that you should not be vaccinated,'' he said. Still, Dr. Longini observed, ''You would protect Grandma better by slowing or stopping the epidemic than by vaccinating her directly.'' Of course, there will always be parents who do not want their children vaccinated. But the beauty of the strategy, the researchers say, is that you don't need to immunize every child. Just getting to the majority of them should do the trick.
If someone developed cancer, heart disease or lung disease -- which will affect about a fifth of people aged 51 to 61 over the next eight years -- the household's income declined by an average of more than $37,000. And its assets -- its wealth -- fell by $49,000 over the ensuing eight years, even though out-of-pocket medical expenses were just $4,000. Dr. Smith also asked whether getting richer made people healthier, an effect that could translate into a longer life. It does not, he concluded after studying the large increases in income during the stock market surge of the 1990s. ''I find almost no role of financial anything in the onset of disease,'' Dr. Smith says. ''That's an almost throw-you-out-of-the-room thing,'' he confesses, but the data, he and other economists insist, is consistent. Income, says Dr. Preston, ''is so heavily influenced by health itself.'' Much More Than Genes and Luck
''If you happened to catch a disease at one of those moments,'' Dr. Joffe explained, ''then your study would show a difference.'' But for other cancers, like those of breast and lung, the study found no such effects. That may be because when experimental treatments helped in these diseases, their benefits have been modest, he said, adding, ''To assume that being in a trial would add a quantum leap is not realistic.'' Cancer experts not connected with the Dana-Farber study said they found it convincing. ''I'm in general accepting of the conclusion'' that there is no good evidence that being in a trial improves patients' outcomes, said Dr. Harmon Eyre, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ''We always need to keep ourselves honest about the communication between doctors and patients. You can't overpromise.'' Dr. Archie Bleyer, director of community oncology and a professor of pediatrics at the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said the paper tended to confirm his suspicions about the overall benefits of clinical trials, but he noted that it did not ask whether quality of life might be better for patients in such trials.
Lung cancer, Dr. Black said, like every other cancer, is a mixture of types. Some tumors are pretty much harmless -- they would never spread and kill and they would have gone undetected were it not for the screening. The result of screening, though, will usually be a cancer diagnosis, treatment and a ''cure.'' Other tumors are deadly no matter when they are found and treated, so finding them early only means more time with the cancer diagnosis. A person, for example, might die five years after symptoms are apparent, no matter what treatment is provided. If the cancer is detected five years before symptoms emerge, the person will survive 10 years after diagnosis as opposed to surviving five years after diagnosis if the cancer is not found until there are symptoms. ''As soon as you advance the date of diagnosis with any screening test, you will improve the apparent survival,'' said Dr. Barnett Kramer, who is associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health.
For some common illnesses, there may be no difference in outcomes between community hospitals and academic medical centers, ones that are connected to medical schools and that serve as referral centers for patients with the most complicated, difficult cases. For heart surgery, what matters appears to be the surgeon's experience, not the number of such patients at the hospital. But for some cancers, the important factor seems to be the total number of patients with that cancer at a hospital, not the number any particular surgeon sees. Everyone agrees that medical statistics are not the only issue. People want to like and trust their doctors. And with a community hospital, patients have the convenience of staying close to home and may be more likely to receive warm, personal care. That was an important consideration for Mary Bruce Buchanan, a 60-year-old retired real estate broker from Flemington, N.J., whose decision about where to go for cancer care went against her own upbringing. Her father, a surgeon, had trained at the University of Pennsylvania and, she said, ''when anything was really wrong, that was where you went.''
Gina Kolata asked two experts on opposite sides of the debate on early screening to look at breast cancer data and discuss what they indicate about screening and treatment. DR. BARNETT KRAMER, director of the Office of Disease Prevention at the National Institutes of Health, looks at national trends in breast cancer and sees hints of overdiagnosis, meaning that mammography is finding many cancers that either would go away if left alone or that would be found and treated when they became larger. He points to two features of the breast cancer data that give him pause. First, the number of new cases that are being found has increased over the past 20 years, since mammography came into widespread use. In 1983, there were 111.0 cases per 100,000 women, while in 1998 that number had risen to 140.5. ''There are very few things that can so dramatically increase the incidence of new disease,'' he said. One is the introduction of a powerful new carcinogen, like tobacco.
But recent research changed all that. Dr. Mooi and Daniel Peeper of the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam showed that the phenomenon explains what happens in moles. Mole cells have a cancer gene, BRAF, that makes them divide. BRAF then turns on another gene, p16, that makes them stop dividing forever. Dr. Leonard Zon and Elizabeth Patton of Children's Hospital, Dr. Fisher, and their colleagues produced moles in zebrafish by giving them the BRAF gene. Next they tried the same experiment in zebrafish that lacked a gene, p53, that prevented the BRAF gene from activating the cell's brakes on cell division. The result was a malignant cancer, moles that quickly turned into deadly melanomas. The same sort of thing happens in the prostate, Dr. Pandolfi discovered. In prostate glands removed from men with early prostate cancer, he saw cancer cells, of course, but he also saw something else: tumors that were the molecular equivalent of moles, made up of senescent cells.
Of course, that leads to the question of why rely on them at all. ''At face value, obviously they shouldn't be doing it,'' Dr. Perl said. But, she said, often when answers are needed and an organism like the pertussis bacterium is finicky and hard to grow in a laboratory, ''you don't have great options.'' Waiting to see if the bacteria grow can take weeks, but the quick molecular test can be wrong. ''It's almost like you're trying to pick the least of two evils,'' Dr. Perl said. At Dartmouth the decision was to use a test, P.C.R., for polymerase chain reaction. It is a molecular test that, until recently, was confined to molecular biology laboratories. ''That's kind of what's happening,'' said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, an infectious disease specialist and professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University. ''That's the reality out there. We are trying to figure out how to use methods that have been the purview of bench scientists.''
But, arthritis researchers say, they know of no biological reason why eating those compounds would help people with arthritis. Dr. Tim McAlindon, chief of rheumatology at Tufts-New England Medical Center in Boston, said that glucosamine traveled to the liver, which then broke it down. Almost no glucosamine that is eaten actually gets into the blood, where it can travel to the joints, Dr. McAlindon said, adding, ''The amount that gets beyond the liver is minuscule.'' Chondroitin, a large molecule, is digested, Dr. McAlindon said, but it is broken into pieces in the intestines and none of it gets through intact to the joints. Still, many arthritis patients swear by the supplements, which cost $30 to $50 a month, said Dr. Andrew Shao, vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade association for the dietary supplement industry. Dr. Stephen E. Straus, director of the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a sponsor of the new study, said a national survey in 2002 found that about 5.2 million Americans had used one or both supplements in the preceding year. Dr. Straus noted that arthritis joint pain and stiffness were among the leading reasons for seeking alternative medical treatments.
In an ideal world, said Dr. Leon Gordis, a professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins, all studies, positive or negative, would be judged by whether they were well done and whether they were interesting. ''I don't think there should be a journal of not finding associations,'' Dr. Gordis said. ''If you have a good study, it should be entered into a prestigious medical journal.'' That, of course, is what happens with studies like the ones on cellphones, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, The Journal of the American Medical Association and The Journal of the National Cancer Institute, or the prostate cancer study, published in The Journal of the American Medical Association. But then, Dr. Gordis and others added, another complication enters in. ''On certain controversial or emotionally charged issues, when do we decide that no further studies are needed?'' Dr. Gordis asked. WITH cellphones, some scientists are continuing to look for evidence of danger. Now, Finnish scientists have announced that they will be reporting on laboratory experiments that suggest that cellphone radiation alters the blood-brain barrier, allowing chemicals into the brain that should be kept out. There is, of course, no evidence that any such thing is happening in humans. But the very effort shows that the cellphone issue remains alive.
But the day after he got home from the hospital, he thought about what had happened. ''The gravity of the situation just sort of clicked,'' Mr. Orr said. ''I started to cry.'' WHAT I WISH I'D KNOWN  Naomi Atrubin, a Survivor of Two Heart Attacks, Shares the Lessons She Has Learned Naomi Atrubin's life might have been different. She would know what was happening that Christmas Eve when she had her first heart attack. She would not have blamed spicy mustard for that heavy feeling in her chest. She would have taken an ambulance. She would have kept better track of her blood pressure and cholesterol. At 76, Ms. Atrubin gets tired but also stays active with duplicate bridge and book clubs. She had chest pains last summer. But she also is grateful that she lived to tell her story.

Teenagers and young adults who watched more than one hour of television daily were more likely to commit violent crimes and engage in other forms of aggressive behavior later, according to a new report. An association between television violence and aggression has been well established by studies over the last four decades. But most research has focused on the television viewing habits of children. The new study, published today in the journal Science, searched for a relationship between television watching and aggression in an older group. The investigators, led by Dr. Jeffrey G. Johnson of Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, followed children in 707 families in two counties in northern New York State for 17 years. They reported that adolescents and young adults who watched television for more than seven hours a week had an increased likelihood of committing an aggressive act in later years. When adjusted for factors like differences in income, the increased likelihood fell between 16 percent and 116 percent.
Although the paper was written in dense jargon and summarized its findings by saying, ''We report the derivation of a pluripotent embryonic stem cell line (SCNT-hES-1) from a cloned human blastocyst,'' its import was immediately clear to researchers. ''My reaction is, basically, wow,'' said Dr. Richard Rawlins, an embryologist who is director of the assisted reproduction laboratories at the Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. ''It's a landmark paper.'' It is what patients with diseases like Parkinson's and diabetes had been waiting for, the start of so-called therapeutic cloning. The idea is to clone a patients cells to make embryonic stem cells that are an exact genetic match of the patient. Then those cells, patients hope, could be turned into replacement tissue to treat or cure their disease without provoking rejection from the body's immune system. Even though the new work clears a significant hurdle, scientists caution that it could take years of further research before stem cell science turns into actual therapies.
Dr. Catalona is of the opposite camp. He says he has moved his cutoff down a notch, to 2.5. He has seen too many men, he says, who ended up with deadly cancers because they waited for their P.S.A. levels to creep above four before having a biopsy. But Dr. Stamey said, ''I have some smart colleagues who are very proud of the fact that they used to stand up at meetings and say, 'I never had a P.S.A. test in my life, and I don't plan to have one.''' Given the new study, he said, ''it looks like they were very insightful.''
The problem with simply reassuring children, Dr. Lifton said, was that then they might imagine that even worse things were happening. What they needed, he said, was to hear that they were safe and that their parents would take care of them. Dr. Howard Weinblatt, a pediatrician in Ann Arbor, Mich., said he told parents that rather than just blurting out everything they knew, they had to use their instincts about how much and what the child really wanted to know. And they must take their child seriously. ''That means stopping what you are doing,'' he said, and listening to what the child was saying. He has found that sometimes children, and even teenagers, have surprising misunderstandings. On Tuesday evening, Dr. Weinblatt said, a 16-year-old girl was at his office for a routine visit. Suddenly, she started talking about the terrorist attacks. ''She said, 'What's going to happen to the world now that they blew up the World Trade Center? Now there won't be any world trade,' '' he said.
''I was still hopeful that there would be an underlying effect on the progression of atherosclerosis,'' Dr. Herrington said. Now, he said, he thinks the question has been answered. ''I think this study, coupled with the HERS trial, is a pretty compelling combination of evidence showing that estrogen replacement therapy is not effective in reducing the risk for heart attacks or heart-disease deaths, or for slowing the disease that's responsible for those heart attacks, in women with established heart disease,'' he said. Others agreed. ''I think it's very convincing that after three years in a well-designed study, there was no evidence of benefit,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Barrett-Connor, a professor of family and preventive medicine at the University of California at San Diego. But the artery study and the HERS study do not address the question of whether hormone therapy at menopause can prevent the development of heart disease in women who do not yet have it.
Eventually, other researchers confirmed the work. And gradually, the thinking among exercise physiologists began to change. ''The evidence has continued to mount,'' said L. Bruce Gladden, a professor of health and human performance at Auburn University. ''It became clear that it is not so simple as to say, Lactic acid is a bad thing and it causes fatigue.'' As for the idea that lactic acid causes muscle soreness, Dr. Gladden said, that never made sense. ''Lactic acid will be gone from your muscles within an hour of exercise,'' he said. ''You get sore one to three days later. The time frame is not consistent, and the mechanisms have not been found.'' The understanding now is that muscle cells convert glucose or glycogen to lactic acid. The lactic acid is taken up and used as a fuel by mitochondria, the energy factories in muscle cells. Mitochondria even have a special transporter protein to move the substance into them, Dr. Brooks found. Intense training makes a difference, he said, because it can make double the mitochondrial mass.
Some providers charge at least $100 more for a medical abortion than a surgical one, explaining that each Mifeprex pill costs $100. Many use a lower dose, giving one pill instead of the three that the company recommends, but say the extra cost of the pill-induced abortion is still a burden for some patients. In addition, many doctors in private practice worry about malpractice insurance if they offer the drug. Some may be put off by requirements that they provide backup surgical abortions if the pills fail. The drug's distributor, Danco Laboratories of New York, said most of the women who used Mifeprex got it at abortion clinics -- just 17 percent of the sales were to doctors' private practices. But Dr. Carole Joffe, a visiting professor in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California at San Francisco, said that if the experience in Europe was any guide, it takes time for medical abortions to take hold.
When patients go to Dr. Stephen Brenner, an internal medicine specialist, for a routine exam, their bills can vary by 45 percent. The uninsured pay the most and patients with insurance plans are charged the least. It is not his doing, said Dr. Brenner, who practices in New Haven. He explains that it is because health insurance companies insist on hefty discounts. ''It's a take it or leave it situation for doctors,'' Dr. Brenner said. But he said he knew that the insured paid much less than their share. For the insured, he said, ''it's almost like getting a BMW or Mercedes at half price.'' Other doctors cite more extreme price disparities. A New York gynecologist says he gets $25 for a routine exam for a woman insured by Group Health Insurance and charges $175 for the same exam for a woman without insurance. ''It's horribly ironic,'' said Paul Menzel, a professor of philosophy at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Wash. The care of the poor once was supported by the wealthy and the insured, but now the opposite is happening, he said. ''It is the people who are most provided for, not the people who are least provided for, who get the benefit of cost-shifting,'' Professor Menzel said.
Dogs have long been used to study human diseases. Rabies, in fact, was first discovered in dogs, insulin was discovered in dogs, and the first open heart surgery was in dogs. Eventually, the team hopes to make dog embryonic stem cells and test them in the animals as treatments. Dogs presented a number of challenges to the researchers. Ovulation is once or twice a year, but not predictable, and no one has found a way to induce ovulation by giving dogs hormones. Eventually, the South Koreans discovered, through trial and error, a signature spike in the hormone progesterone that signaled ovulation. With other animals, scientists collect mature eggs from ovaries, but the eggs dogs ovulate are immature. They mature in the oviduct and so far it has proved impossible to extract eggs from a dog's ovary and mature them in the laboratory. So the researchers had to pinpoint when to pluck a mature egg from the oviduct, and needed surgery to retrieve it, instead of the kind of needle suctioning used in other animals.
The 2,000 people, the worried well, who come each year to Memorial Sloan-Kettering's cancer prevention center will learn that many cancers can, in fact, be prevented, and that it is up to them to have the appropriate medical tests and to live right. For their $2,000 fee, most of which is paid by health insurance, they may be steered to smoking cessation sessions, or watch a cooking demonstration and hear a talk by a nutritionist. They will learn the early signs and symptoms of cancer and they almost certainly will have a cancer screening test. ''There is a lot that can be done to prevent cancer and detect it early,'' said Dr. Moshe Shike, the center's director. ''We could probably cut cancer mortality by 50 percent.'' Stopping smoking can prevent many forms of cancer, and changes in diet and weight loss also may have a marked effect. And while screening may find only cancer that is already present, it can save lives by catching it early.
The story is reaching its culmination now, with the unexpected discovery of drugs that appear to selectively inhibit cox-2, an enzyme involved in inflammation. Until recently, the only drugs that blocked this enzyme also had a troublesome side effect. The older drugs, which include aspirin and the anti-inflammatory drug sulindac, can cause bleeding, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. But new cox-2 inhibitors are essentially free of this problem. And so the cancer institute, working with Searle, is beginning large studies involving thousands of Americans, asking whether people at risk for cancers of the colon, skin, esophagus or bladder can protect themselves by taking the new drugs. Merck is starting a similar study on its own, with its cox-2 inhibitor, asking if it can prevent colon cancer. The studies are not the first to look at drugs that prevent cancer. The institute has studied beta-carotene and vitamin A, for example, but has failed to find anti-cancer effects. It also has another major prevention initiative under way, comparing two drugs, tamoxifen and raloxifen, for the prevention of breast cancer. Both drugs can block estrogen, which often promotes breast cancer growth. But both drugs can also lead to potentially fatal blood clots, and tamoxifen doubles a woman's risk of developing uterine cancer.
Investigators emphasize that only a small number of women in the study actually had heart attacks, strokes or blood clots in the lungs or the legs. The exact numbers were in the hands of an independent committee that oversees the study, and its members would not reveal them even to the study investigators. But overall, only about 1 percent of all the women, who were 50 to 79, had these problems in the first two years of the study. The effect seems to be diminishing as the study continues, the researchers say. Yet apparently, these grave medical problems were disproportionately concentrated in the women taking hormones that were supposed to prevent them. ''This is the most widely prescribed drug in America,'' said Cindy Pearson, the executive director of the National Women's Health Network, an advocacy group in Washington. ''A lot of the women are taking it because they've been told by their doctors that it will prevent a heart attack. Those are the women who should be sitting up and taking notice and going to their doctors and saying, 'Why am I taking this? What's the point of this?' ''
Dr. Pickhardt said, ''It's an educational issue.'' Most very tiny polyps are inconsequential, he explained, adding that virtually none are cancerous and that many shrink on their own. Those that do not shrink grow so slowly that they can be checked again in a few years. ''The tiny risk of a small polyp doesn't outweigh the risk of undergoing an invasive procedure to remove it,'' he said. But he and others are optimistic that if the new virtual colonoscopy study can be replicated, the public may soon have another option for colon cancer screening. And that, colon cancer experts hope, may encourage more people to be screened. Many simply ignore the public health advice to have colon cancer screening starting at age 50, finding the available options unappealing. ''Boy, do we need a better test,'' Dr. Harris said. ''The tests we have now all have problems.'' Professional groups recommend regular screening with any of four methods. The most accurate, most invasive and most expensive, at about $2,000, is colonoscopy, which must be repeated every decade.
The study by the group in Rockford suggests a way to improve colonoscopy: by slowing down. ''If you rush things, you miss things,'' Dr. Schoen said. That happens in part because reimbursement rates for colonoscopies have fallen in recent years, and some doctors are doing the exams faster than ever, Dr. Schoen and others say. ''I have heard of people who do it in 30 seconds,'' Dr. Schoen said. ''Whoosh, and it's out.'' The Rockford group concluded that doctors should take at least eight minutes to withdraw the endoscope. To remind themselves, they set a timer with a bell that rings once at two minutes, twice at four minutes, three times at six minutes, and four times at eight minutes. Their polyp-detection rate has increased by 50 percent, Dr. Barclay said. Last spring, a task force for the American College of Gastroenterology and the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy recommended that doctors track their polyp-detection rate. On average, they should find precancerous polyps in at least 25 percent of men and 15 percent of women 50 and older.
Most hospitals, she said, cannot offer angioplasty because they do not have enough patients for a team of doctors to maintain their skills. An obvious solution would be to make heart attack care more like trauma care -- sending patients to the nearest hospital that can provide angioplasty as quickly as possible. But that is not always easy, Dr. Jacobs said, because hospitals do not want to lose cardiac patients. A major reason, she said, is financial. Hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare according an index that measures the acuity of medical conditions they treat. ''If your cardiac patients are transferred, your acuity index goes down, which lowers overall Medicare reimbursement for other problems like pneumonia and renal disease,'' Dr. Jacobs said. It is also difficult for patients who live in rural areas, where community hospitals are too small to offer angioplasty and larger hospitals that do offer it are hours away. Minnesota is experimenting with a program using helicopters to transport patients quickly. But for most rural patients elsewhere, angioplasty is almost an impossibility.
It has been nearly a month now since the government announced that a Florida man had come down with inhalation anthrax, a disease that almost no doctor in the United States had ever seen and few had thought about. ''It is an isolated case,'' Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said at a White House briefing on Oct. 4. ''There is no terrorism.'' But now, with seven cases of the deadly inhalation anthrax confirmed in addition to seven of the less serious cutaneous type,  scientists and government officials are having to rethink everything they thought they knew about anthrax, and they candidly admit that much of what they thought was wrong. The biggest lesson so far, some say, is that despite years of discussing and imagining how a bioterrorism attack might occur, and how it might be recognized, the actual attack took everyone by surprise. And experts say that is the very nature of terrorism.
This time, with in vitro fertilization at Cornell and IVIG treatments elsewhere, Ms. Todd became pregnant and had a baby, Alexander Leighton, born in November 2002. Even couples who are determined not to bankrupt themselves and who spurn unconventional treatments can quickly find themselves in debt. Virginia and Brian Henry of Brick, N.J., had insurance that covered four in vitro fertilization attempts in a lifetime. After two tries at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, paying $25,000 not covered by insurance, they had Connor, now a year old. To pay the bills, they took out a home equity loan and borrowed against their 401(k). Ms. Henry, a human resources specialist, took on a second job selling real estate. With insurance to cover two more attempts, they tried again, hoping to have another baby. But Ms. Henry failed to become pregnant. She knew the odds were against her. ''I just turned 40, and as I'm getting older my chances are not getting better,'' she said.
Unfortunately, he said, cancer, and prostate cancer in particular, is not like that. ''If the P.S.A. gets very high, it is telling us something,'' he said. But lower levels, certainly levels below 10, lead to the discovery of microscopic cancers that no one understands. Most are harmless and will never grow. Some are dangerous, but there is no way of distinguishing between the two. ''We just don't know what it means,'' Dr. Welch said. Prostate cancer is so common that virtually every man gets it if he lives long enough, said Dr. Thomas A. Stamey, a professor of urology at Stanford. Yet only rarely is it life-threatening. Screening, Dr. Stamey said, fueled by a false sense of confidence in what is normal and what is not, has led to far too many biopsies, far too many discoveries of cancers that pose no danger, far too many prostates removed or destroyed.
MOZART, in fact, had little to do with it, according to a new study by Kristin Nantais of the University of Windsor in Canada and E. Glenn Schellenberg of the University of Toronto at Mississauga. Students did comparatively better on the test after listening to Mozart's music, but they did just as well after listening to Shubert or after simply listening to a story. The investigators suggest that the negative effect may have been irritation or boredom from hearing the stultifying relaxation tape or sitting through 10 deadly minutes of silence. But the Mozart effect sounded so right to parents and policymakers. It had the same sort of intuitive zing as the alarms over television viewing or sugar consumption. What could be wrong with telling people to listen to classical music or to turn off the television or cut back on sugar? ''I guess I just take umbrage at misstating science and taking liberties with science,'' Dr. Nelson said. ''Then you open the door to people saying anything they want to say under the guise of science.'' People can also open the door to bitter disillusionment when the true facts emerge, he added. ''I can imagine a lawsuit five years from now by some mother in Georgia saying, 'Hey. I let my baby listen to that Mozart CD and he's in jail now.' ''
Doctors in many parts of the country say the demand for colonoscopies to screen for colon cancer has surged so much in recent years that patients are having to wait months or are simply being turned away. The colonoscopy is widely viewed as the most accurate screening test, but it is also the most expensive and risky, and there are other ways to screen for colon cancer. But while most professional organizations say the choice of a test should be up to the patient, fewer Americans are choosing the other options, which include flexible sigmoidoscopy, fecal occult blood tests and barium enemas. Regular screening is recommended for everyone 50 and over, once a year to once a decade, depending on the patient and the procedure. Colonoscopy ''has become a fashion,'' said Dr. Daniel Sulmasy, an ethicist and internist at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York, adding, ''All these other options just drop off the radar screen.''
''There are endless possibilities for doing bad statistical inferences,'' said Persi Diaconis, a statistician at Stanford University. And when we look at our parents, or our children, and see ourselves, it is easier than we think to get caught in the multiple-end-points statistical trap. Of course, we also have an urge to see what we want to see in our relatives, and the multiple-end-points problem lets us do it with abandon. ''You get to pick which features you want to resonate to,'' Professor Diaconis said. ''When you look at your mom, you might say, 'I'm exactly the opposite.' Someone else might say, 'Hmm.' '' Yet the more scientists learn about particular genes, the more they can tell us what is inherited from our ancestors. The focus is on disease, which is, after all, the legacy  that can change our lives the most. Instead of looking at a mosaic of personality traits as well as appearances, talents and diseases that seem to run in families, many geneticists are stalking tiny variations in the genetic blueprints of individuals that can say whether a disease will show up in the future. Or, most commonly, they are seeking genetic variations that will tell us whether we have a predisposition to a disease. Whether we get the disease may depend on how well we take care of ourselves or whether scientists can develop drugs to prevent the disease for those who are susceptible. Or it may depend on blind luck. But with the emerging plethora of genetic information, the question now is, How much do we want to know?
But many people, including doctors, wonder if they should plan for medical emergencies or for a sudden diagnosis of a serious disease and, if so, how. That is what troubled Dr. Peter K. Lindenauer, an internist and medical researcher at Baystate Medical Center in Springfield, Mass., and Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. At parties and at family gatherings, he said, friends, relatives and acquaintances often sidled up to him and asked for advice about where to go for medical care. He would tell them that if they had something as common as pneumonia or needed surgery for something as mundane as a hernia, they probably would do at least as well at a small local hospital as they would at a major medical center. But, he said, ''those comments were based more on gut than on actual evidence.'' He decided to look for proof. Dr. Lindenauer and his colleagues began looking at national data on two common conditions: pneumonia, the fifth-leading cause of death in America, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a lung disease that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema and is the fourth-leading cause of death. ''When we think about bread-and-butter medical problems, these are the classic ones,'' Dr. Lindenauer said.
When people try to lose weight, said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, an obesity researcher and co-director of the diabetes center at Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons, they eat less and the body sends out signals that it is hungry, among them the hormone ghrelin, made by the stomach. If people ignore them and manage to shed some pounds, the body responds by lowering its metabolic rate, making it easy to regain the weight.
Dr. Hirsch and others point out that years of research consistently show that if someone's weight gets out of her genetically determined range -- either because she has managed to eat so much that she becomes fatter or because she diets so much that she becomes thinner -- her body is driven to lose or gain weight to force her weight back in line. Those who are above their range lose their appetites and lose interest in food. At the same time, their body's metabolism actually speeds up to push their weight back down. Those who are below their range become obsessed with food and unable to control their urges to eat. In that situation, the body's metabolism slows down to make the pounds creep back on, researchers find. That, of course, does not mean that environment plays no role in making people grow fat. After all, researchers add, genes cannot change overnight, but environments can. And something must be making people gain weight. Many experts say that more and more Americans are responding to a society that insidiously encourages them to be as fat as their genes will allow them to be. Instead of being at the bottom of their weight range, like the chronic dieters, many people are at the top.
''It lends itself to corruption,'' Dr. Behr said. ''You end up doing things that may not be ethical -- selecting patients, transferring more embryos than may be safe, doing anything so you don't have to give the money back.'' By transferring multiple embryos, doctors risk creating pregnancies of triplets, quadruplets and more. Doctors who offer such programs defend them. Dr. John I. Gilliland, the program director of the Northern California Fertility Medical Center in Roseville, said women under 35 could pay $12,500 for an attempt to get pregnant with in vitro fertilization. If they fail, the center gives back $9,200 so that the woman will have spent only $3,300. A single attempt would ordinarily cost $7,900. ''There may be some suspicion as to how we may handle patients,'' Dr. Gilliland said. ''It's obviously to my advantage to get her pregnant the first time. Theoretically, you could transfer more embryos. But there's not any circumstance where I would even consider doing that.''
Eric Oliver, a political scientist at the University of Chicago, said his first instinct was to laugh at the gas and drive-through arguments. But such claims often get wide attention, he says, and take on a life of their own. ''This is like, let's find another reason to scapegoat fat people,'' Dr. Oliver says. At an annual meeting of the Obesity Society, one talk correlated obesity with deaths in car accidents, and another correlated obesity with suicides. Dr. Oliver, who attended, said no one in the crowd of at least 200 questioned whether the correlations were really cause and effect. ''The funny thing was that everyone took it seriously,'' he said. Katherine Flegal of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also wryly cautions against being quick to link cause and effect. ''Yes, obesity is to blame for all the evils of modern life, except somehow, weirdly, it is not killing people enough,'' she said. ''In fact that's why there are all these fat people around. They just won't die.''
In their paper, the researchers suggested another possible reason that the overall death rate was not lower. Men who had surgery might die at a higher rate from causes other than prostate cancer because of ''hitherto unknown adverse effects of prostatectomy,'' they wrote. For example, medical experts said, a man who had a prostate operation might develop blood clots that killed him with a stroke the next month. The Swedish investigators also questioned the men about their quality of life and found that those who had the surgery were more likely to be impotent, 80 percent, as compared to 45 percent who had watchful waiting. They also were more likely to be incontinent. But they were less likely to complain that it was difficult to urinate. The men in both groups had similar assessments of the overall quality of their lives. When it comes to men with very tiny tumors, found by P.S.A. screening, doctors say that the operation could reduce the death rate from prostate cancer either more or less than in the Swedish study. The test finds tumors five to seven years before they would cause symptoms, leaving men an extra five to seven years to live with the possible surgical side effects, like impotence and incontinence. Dr. Michael Barry, who is chief of the general medicine unit at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said that some tumors detected by screening are so small and grow so slowly that they are found only on autopsy, so men die with them, not of them.
As for genetic screening to see who is susceptible to cancer, that is still in its infancy, Dr. Berry said. There are a couple of genes that predispose to breast cancer and a couple that predispose to colorectal cancer. ''Not much is known beyond that,'' he said. And other than taking tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer or having one's breasts, ovaries or colon removed to prevent cancers in those organs, what does someone do who is genetically susceptible? Another research question, Dr. Berry said. When it comes to other prevention strategies, like diet, Dr. Kramer said, ''it gets a lot trickier.'' He urges caution in jumping to conclusions that specific foods, or diets, or even weight loss will be protective. Researchers often find associations between diets and cancer risk, but that does not mean that a particular diet or food caused or prevented cancer, he said. The history of research in this area has been sobering.
''I thought the secret was that my islets were better than anyone else's,'' she said. But when she and Dr. David Nathan, the director of the diabetes center at the hospital, tried using her islets, they also failed. So Dr. Faustman decided to go back to the laboratory and study the phenomenon in mice. Researchers had reported that islet transplants could cure diabetes in mice, but they had been making them diabetic by destroying their islet cells. Dr. Faustman decided to look at mice with a strong genetic predisposition to develop diabetes on their own. When the islet cell transplants failed in those animals, she asked why. Diabetes occurs when a white blood cell, part of the body's immune system, migrates to the pancreas and mistakenly sees islet cells as foreign tissue. It then multiplies and destroys the islets. But, Dr. Faustman learned, she could block the white cells by supplying them with a piece of protein that signaled that the islet cells were normal cells, rather than foreign invaders.
Yet many of his friends and relatives remain convinced. ''That's the way people think,'' Dr. Gallo said. ''If you get cancer, there has to be a reason.'' And there may be a reason, he and other scientists say. But pinning cancer on trace levels of poisons in the environment or even in the workplace is turning out to be a vexing task. There has been recent progress in addressing the issue, but the answers that many people believe must be out there remain elusive. ''It's an area where there's certainly been a lot of heat and not a lot of light for some time,'' said Robert Hoover, director of the epidemiology and biostatistics program at the National Cancer Institute. For the most part, Dr. Hoover said, ''we are down to speculations based on some data but without having the information we need.'' Members of advocacy groups agree that there is much to learn, but they say the questions are too important to brush off by saying the research is difficult or the questions complex.
''We have to conclude, and I will say this with a lot of experience, that this product is performing extremely well,'' Mr. LaViolette said. But a few cardiologists reported in telephone interviews that they got into trouble after the stent, a small wire tube used to hold open arteries, was slipped into place. Like all stents, Boston Scientific's stent, the Taxus Express2 , comes packaged with a deflated balloon inside. A cardiologist threads the stent with its balloon into an artery. When the site of the blockage is reached, the doctor inflates the balloon, pressing the stent against the artery wall. Then the balloon is deflated and the catheter and balloon withdrawn, leaving the stent flush against the artery, holding the vessel open. Some doctors said the balloon stuck on the stent when they were removing it. Some were able to free the balloon; some were not. Dr. William Campbell, director of the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Borgess Heart Institute in Kalamazoo, Mich., said a patient was rushed into emergency open heart surgery to remove the balloon and stent.
For now, said Dr. Clifford Hudis, a co-author of the paper and chief of the breast cancer service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, cancer treatment recommendations should not change. The new results, Dr. Hudis said, are ''hypothesis generating'' and call out for further research. Doctors need reliable tests of tumors with estrogen receptors, and they need studies to show that those tests can pick out the women who will do as well with just hormonal treatments to starve tumors of estrogen as they will with hormonal treatments and chemotherapy. The field is in a transition period, Dr. Winer said, adding that the question for cancer specialists and women with estrogen receptor positive tumors is how far to push the envelope. Should a woman take a chance that the currently available tests will tell her that she will or will not respond to chemotherapy? Or should she decide that since, on average, women with estrogen-fed tumors gain a small survival benefit from chemotherapy, she cannot forgo the treatment?
Angus Deaton, an economist at Princeton, had a hip replacement last year. And while he was happy with the outcome, he wondered how much it had cost. He got a few answers. His hospital room was $10,000 a day. ''Telephone and television were extra,'' he said. As for the total cost , there were so many charges associated with one service after another -- anesthesia, pain management, physical therapy, the surgery itself -- that he was never able to figure out how much each of them cost. ''Maybe if I devoted my life to this for six months I could find out,'' Dr. Deaton said. ''The price that is paid is the price an insurer negotiates, and that is kept in a vault somewhere.'' All he knows for sure is that insurers say they pay, on average, $50,000 for a hip replacement. Dr. Deaton's story is the sort that makes people cringe. The United States already spends nearly 16 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, and it is almost impossible to know where all that money goes. Projections are that health care will take up even more of the G.D.P. as the population ages and as more expensive drugs and medical devices are developed.
Another institute study is assessing chest X-rays by randomly assigning participants to have an annual X-rays or to have no screening. In the meantime, cancer specialists say doctors and their patients must decide, on an individual basis, what to do. They could wait for the clinical trials to be completed, or they could decide to have scans now, while the data may not be ideal. And the scans can be expensive. Dr. Howard Forman, a professor of diagnostic radiology at Yale, says that Yale charges $802.39 for the scan and the doctor's interpretation. And while many insurers do not pay for CT lung cancer screening tests, that may change, Dr. Forman said. He said he did not find this study to be convincing -- like others, he said he needed to see control group data. But Dr. Forman, who is on the Medical Policy and Technology Assessment Committee for Wellpoint, an insurance company, said it would be hard to deny paying for the test now that the data were in The New England Journal of Medicine.
For now, AIDS experts say, the virus is a formidable opponent. ''There are very few viruses that maintain a persistent replication in the face of an active immune response,'' Dr. Coffin said. But, he added, ''That's the niche this virus has evolved into.'' The Discovery  Some Can Fight The AIDS Virus The study that Jim H. joined has roots in the spring of 1994, when Robert Massey, the executive director of Ceres, a coalition of environmental, investor and advocacy groups, showed up at Massachusetts General Hospital, urging doctors to study him. He told them that he was infected with H.I.V. but had never been treated. And his immune system was fine. Mr. Massey first learned he was infected in 1984, when he had an AIDS test as part of a research study. He was not surprised by the result, he explained, because of his  hemophilia, and, like virtually every other American with this genetic disease who was alive in the early 1980's, he was repeatedly exposed to H.I.V. through the blood clotting factors made from pooled blood of donors. In those early years of the epidemic, before H.I.V. was discovered and a blood test developed, infected donors could not be identified, so blood often contained the virus.
But even debating the question poses problems. The answers can determine whether scientists can proceed with experiments on isolated human embryo cells that they hope will revolutionize medicine or whether they will be required to treat single human embryo cells with the same restraint that they treat a human embryo. ''People who hold a pro-life view regard the human embryo from the moment of conception as a fully protectable human being,'' said Dr. Ronald Green, director of the Ethics Institute of Dartmouth College. So, discussions of whether embryo cells are the equivalent of embryos or the equivalent of human tissue, like skin or muscle, are being carried out with abortion debates in the background. ''That's a tremendous pressure in these discussion,'' Dr. Green said. The mouse embryo cells the Canadian scientists studied were of a special type, known as stem cells, that in theory could grow into any tissues or organs, although not -- most assumed until the experiment -- into an entire mouse.
The screening debate is far from settled. Although he agrees with Dr. Cunningham on the need to evaluate tests, Dr. Larry Norton, a specialist on breast cancer at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York and the president of the American Society for Clinical Oncology, said he still strongly believed that early diagnosis made biological sense. The theory behind early diagnosis, Dr. Norton added, comes from years of work with animals that repeatedly shows that cancers treated early can be cured and that if they are left to grow and spread, cure becomes impossible. ''On the basis of animal models, my predisposition is to believe that early diagnosis is a good thing,'' Dr. Norton said. He said he knew of no exceptions in the animal research. There is no reason, he said, to think that humans are inherently different from animals. ''Early diagnosis works in animals, and basically mammals are mammals,'' Dr. Norton added.
Perhaps, Ms. Wong said, the doctor did not want to spend the time to talk to her, or perhaps he was put off by her Chinese accent and thought she would not understand. In any event, she never returned to that doctor. When she got her medical records, she learned that she had had hepatitis A, a viral liver infection. Ms. Wong had come across a bane of the medical profession: the difficult doctor. These doctors may be arrogant or rude, highhanded or dismissive. They drive away patients who need help, and some have been magnets for malpractice claims. And while such doctors have always been part of medicine, medical organizations say they fear that they are increasingly common -- doctors, under pressure to see more patients, are spending less and less time with each one and are replacing long discussions with laboratory tests and scans -- and that most problem doctors apparently have no idea of their patients' opinions of them.
Dr. Berry and Dr. Freedman agree that the study had a great strength: it was done when mammograms were not in general use, so women who were randomly assigned to forgo the screening were unlikely to have it on their own. In later years, when mammograms were easily available, researchers struggled with the problem of women assigned not to be screened who had mammograms on their own anyway. The two also agree that the study had a potential flaw. The researchers began by randomly assigning women to have mammograms or not. But they also decided that they did not want to include women who already had breast cancer. So after the women were assigned, they dropped women who, they later realized from looking at medical records, had had cancer. About 1,100 ended up being dropped -- some 800 from the mammography group and about 300 from the control group. Critics of the study wonder why so many more women in the screening group turned out to have had a diagnosis of breast cancer before the study began. In theory, they say, the numbers should have been roughly equal. As a result, they wonder if some women who had already had breast cancer were wrongly left in the control group.
The Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Health and Human Services are investigating as well. The university has suspended all of the 10 studies being conducted by the principal investigator, Dr. Alkis Togias, an associate professor of clinical immunology. Joann Rodgers, a university spokeswoman, said the university was ''having discussions with the family.'' But she did not know whether a lawsuit had been filed. The report issued today depicted a study that went horribly awry. And it raises questions of what is required to assure the utmost safety for volunteers in research. The study was investigating why healthy people and people with asthma responded so differently to substances that constricted their airways. When the constriction occurs, people without asthma can breathe deeply and make their airways relax, but those with asthma cannot get their airways to relax. The researchers hypothesized that nerves in the lungs controlled this relaxation. They proposed constricting the airways of volunteers with one drug and then giving them a second drug, hexamethonium. That drug temporarily blocks the nerves in their lungs from responding normally. The combination of drugs can simulate an asthma attack.
Competitive runners are also efficient, exerting themselves less than those with less talent. Conventional wisdom says the energy required to run a mile is the same, no matter whether you are fast or slow. But it turns out that elite runners simply do not work as hard as the less able. In a study of elite runners, good runners and untrained, but equally physically fit runners, Dr. Don Morgan, an exercise physiologist and recreational runner at Middle Tennessee State University, and his colleagues found that the better the runners were, the less effort they exerted running at a particular pace. But within a group of equally good runners, there were profound differences in efficiency. In treadmill tests, Dr. Morgan found that one runner could end up burning 20 percent more calories than another running the same distance at the same speed. The inefficient runners were not necessarily those who looked more awkward as they ran.
Dr. Weinstein said that Mr. Hano's problem was a huge, bulging disk, a herniation so severe that most doctors would say he should stop running immediately. Dr. Weinstein, though, thought exercise would help Mr. Hano heal. His treatment was a single injection of cortisone into the inflamed area around his disk. The sciatica gradually went away. And Mr. Hano continues to run. ''I had faith that I was going to be able to work through it,'' Mr. Hano said. ''I don't want to not do what I like just because I'm in pain.'' Moving Down the Road to Recovery I WAS injured on a nighttime run on Oct. 10. I had run nine and a half miles two days before, which was long for me. Then, the night of my injury, I got lost trying to check out a 10 kilometer course and ran way too far. By the time I got back to my car, my left forefoot ached. The next day I could barely walk.
''Those are the most remarkable data I have ever seen,'' said Dr. Eric Peterson, the Duke researcher who directed the study and has reported on it at medical meetings. The new efforts to improve care came about because the time was right, health care researchers say. ''It's really an accumulation of scientific knowledge about what quality means,'' Dr. Califf said. And there was a growing realization that quality care was not always being provided. But when it comes to improving care, there is always the contentious issue of deciding what is good medicine. ''Most of what we do has a modest effect, and that means, by the very nature of the effects, that you can't tell whether what you are doing is effective unless you do a study,'' Dr. Califf said. But that takes time, money, and often thousands or tens of thousands of patients. In most cases, such studies have not been done.
But the questions for researchers like Dr. Smith are why? And what really matters? The answers, he and others say, have been a surprise. The one social factor that researchers agree is consistently linked to longer lives in every country where it has been studied is education. It is more important than race; it obliterates any effects of income. Year after year, in study after study, says Richard Hodes, director of the National Institute on Aging, education ''keeps coming up.'' And, health economists say, those factors that are popularly believed to be crucial -- money and health insurance, for example, pale in comparison. Dr. Smith explains: ''Giving people more Social Security income, or less for that matter, will not really affect people's health. It is a good thing to do for other reasons but not for health.'' Health insurance, too, he says, ''is vastly overrated in the policy debate.'' Instead, Dr. Smith and others say, what may make the biggest difference is keeping young people in school. A few extra years of school is associated with extra years of life and vastly improved health decades later, in old age.
